Our presentation stresses the funda-mentals of database modeling and design, the languages and models provided by the database management systems, and database system implementation techniques. The book is meant to be used as a textbook for a one- or two-semester course in database systems at the junior, senior, or graduate level, and as a reference book. Our goal is to provide an in-depth and up-to-date presentation of the most important aspects of database systems and applications, and related technologies. We assume that readers are familiar with elementary programming and data-structuring con-cepts and that they have had some exposure to the basics of computer organization.\\nNew to This Edition\\nThe following key features have been added in the seventh edition:\\n ■A reorganization of the chapter ordering (this was based on a survey of the \\ninstructors who use the textbook); however, the book is still organized so that the individual instructor can choose to follow the new chapter ordering or choose a different ordering of chapters  (for example, follow the chapter \\norder from the sixth edition) when presenting the materials.\\n ■There are two new chapters on recent advances in database systems and big \\ndata processing; one new chapter (Chapter 24) covers an introduction to the newer class of database systems known as NOSQL databases , and the other \\nnew chapter (Chapter 25) covers technologies for processing big data , \\nincluding MapReduce  and Hadoop.\\n ■The chapter on query processing and optimization has been expanded and \\nreorganized into two chapters; Chapter 18 focuses on strategies and algo-rithms for query processing whereas Chapter 19 focuses on query optimiza-tion techniques.\\n ■A second UNIVERSITY database example has been added to the early chap-\\nters (Chapters 3 through 8) in addition to our COMPANY database example from the previous editions.\\n ■Many of the individual chapters have been updated to varying degrees to include \\nnewer techniques and methods; rather than discuss these enhancements here, Preface\\nvii'),\n",

The book is now divided into 12 parts as follows:\\n ■Part 1 (Chapters 1 and 2) describes the basic introductory concepts neces-\\nsary for a good understanding of database models, systems, and languages. Chapters 1 and 2 introduce databases, typical users, and DBMS concepts, \\nterminology, and architecture, as well as a discussion of the progression of database technologies over time and a brief history of data models. These chapters have been updated to introduce some of the newer technologies such as NOSQL systems.\\n ■Part 2 (Chapters 3 and 4) includes the presentation on entity-relationship \\nmodeling and database design; however, it is important to note  that instruc-\\ntors can cover the relational model chapters (Chapters 5 through 8) before \\nChapters  3 and 4  if that is their preferred order of presenting the course \\nmaterials. In Chapter 3, the concepts of the Entity-Relationship (ER) model and ER diagrams are presented and used to illustrate conceptual database design. Chapter 4 shows how the basic ER model can be extended to incorpo-rate additional modeling concepts such as subclasses, specialization, gener-alization, union types (categories) and inheritance, leading to the enhanced-ER (EER) data model and EER diagrams. The notation for the class \\ndiagrams of UML are also introduced in Chapters 7 and 8 as an alternative model and diagrammatic notation for ER/EER diagrams.\\n ■Part 3 (Chapters 5 through 8) includes a detailed presentation on relational \\ndatabases and SQL with some additional new material in the SQL chapters \\nto cover a few SQL constructs that were not in the previous edition. Chapter 5'),\n",

Chapter 6 describes some of the basic parts of the SQL standard for relational databases, including data definition, data modification opera-tions, and simple SQL queries. Chapter 7 presents more complex SQL que-ries, as well as the SQL concepts of triggers, assertions, views, and schema modification. Chapter 8 describes the formal operations of the relational algebra and introduces the relational calculus. The material on SQL (Chap-ters 6 and 7) is presented before our presentation on relational algebra and calculus in Chapter 8 to allow instructors to start SQL projects early in a course if they wish (it is possible to cover Chapter 8 before Chapters 6 and 7 if the instructor desires this order). The final chapter in Part 2, Chapter 9, covers ER- and EER-to-relational mapping, which are algorithms that can be used for designing a relational database schema from a conceptual ER/EER schema design.\\n ■Part 4 (Chapters 10 and 11) are the chapters on database programming tech-\\nniques; these chapters can be assigned as reading materials and augmented with materials on the particular language used in the course for program-ming projects (much of this documentation is readily available on the Web). Chapter 10 covers traditional SQL programming topics, such as embedded SQL, dynamic SQL, ODBC, SQLJ, JDBC, and SQL/CLI . Chapter 11 introduces \\nWeb database programming, using the PHP scripting language in our exam-ples, and includes new material that discusses Java technologies for Web database programming.\\n ■Part 5 (Chapters 12 and 13) covers the updated material on object-relational \\nand object-oriented databases (Chapter 12) and XML (Chapter 13); both of these chapters now include a presentation of how the SQL standard incorpo-rates object concepts and XML concepts into more recent versions of the SQL standard. Chapter 12 first introduces the concepts for object databases, and then shows how they have been incorporated into the SQL standard in order to add object capabilities to relational database systems. It then covers the ODMG object model standard, and its object definition and query lan-guages. Chapter 13 covers the XML (eXtensible Markup Language) model and languages, and discusses how XML is related to database systems. It presents XML concepts and languages, and compares the XML model to traditional database models. We also show how data can be converted between the XML and relational representations, and the SQL commands for extracting XML documents from relational tables.\\n ■Part 6 (Chapters 14 and 15) are the normalization and relational design \\ntheory chapters (we moved all the formal aspects of normalization algo-\\nrithms to Chapter 15). Chapter 14 defines functional dependencies, and \\nthe normal forms that are based on functional dependencies. Chapter 14 \\nalso develops a step-by-step intuitive normalization approach, and includes the definitions of multivalued dependencies and join dependencies. Chapter 15 covers normalization theory, and the formalisms, theories,'),\n",

Chapter 16 describes primary methods of organizing files of records on disk, including ordered (sorted), unordered (heap), and hashed files; both static and dynamic hashing techniques for disk files are covered. Chapter 16 has been updated to include materials on buffer management strategies for DBMSs as well as an overview of new storage devices and standards for files and mod-ern storage architectures. Chapter 17 describes indexing techniques for files, including B-tree and B\\n+-tree data structures and grid files, and has been \\nupdated with new examples and an enhanced discussion on indexing, including how to choose appropriate indexes and index creation during physical design.\\n ■Part 8 (Chapters 18 and 19) includes the chapters on query processing algo-\\nrithms (Chapter 18) and optimization techniques (Chapter 19); these two chapters have been updated and reorganized from the single chapter that covered both topics in the previous editions and include some of the newer techniques that are used in commercial DBMSs. Chapter 18 presents algo-rithms for searching for records on disk files, and for joining records from two files (tables), as well as for other relational operations. Chapter 18 con-tains new material, including a discussion of the semi-join and anti-join operations with examples of how they are used in query processing, as well as a discussion of techniques for selectivity estimation. Chapter 19 covers techniques for query optimization using cost estimation and heuristic rules; \\nit includes new material on nested subquery optimization, use of histograms, physical optimization, and join ordering methods and optimization of typical queries in data warehouses.\\n ■Part 9 (Chapters 20, 21, and 22) covers transaction processing concepts; \\nconcurrency control; and database recovery from failures. These chapters have been updated to include some of the newer techniques that are used in some commercial and open source DBMSs. Chapter 20 introduces the techniques needed for transaction processing systems, and defines the concepts of recoverability and serializability of schedules; it has a new sec-tion on buffer replacement policies for DBMSs and a new discussion on the concept of snapshot isolation. Chapter 21 gives an overview of the var-ious types of concurrency control protocols, with a focus on two-phase locking. We also discuss timestamp ordering and optimistic concurrency control techniques, as well as multiple-granularity locking. Chapter 21 includes a new presentation of concurrency control methods that are based on the snapshot isolation concept. Finally, Chapter 23 focuses on database recovery protocols, and gives an overview of the concepts and techniques that are used in recovery.'),\n",

Chapter 23 introduces distributed database concepts, incl uding availability and scalability, replication and fragmenta-\\ntion of data, maintaining data consistency among replicas, and many other concepts and techniques. In Chapter 24, NOSQL systems are categorized into four general categories with an example system in each category used for our examples, and the data models, operations, as well as the replica-tion/distribution/scalability strategies of each type of NOSQL system are discussed and compared. In Chapter 25, the MapReduce programming model for distributed processing of big data is introduced, and then we have presentations of the Hadoop system and HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System), as well as the Pig and Hive high-level interfaces, and the \\nYARN architecture.\\n ■Part 11 (Chapters 26 through 29) is entitled Advanced Database Models, \\nSystems, and Applications and includes the following materials: Chapter 26 \\nintroduces several advanced data models including active data- \\nbases/triggers (Section 26.1), temporal databases (Section 26.2), spatial data-bases (Section 26.3), multimedia databases (Section 26.4), and deductive databases (Section 26.5). Chapter 27 discusses information retrieval (IR) and Web search, and includes topics such as IR and keyword-based search, comparing DB with IR, retrieval models, search evaluation, and ranking \\nalgorithms. Chapter 28 is an introduction to data mining including over-views of various data mining methods such as associate rule mining, cluster-ing, classification, and sequential pattern discovery. Chapter 29 is an overview of data warehousing including topics such as data warehousing models and operations, and the process of building a data warehouse.\\n ■Part 12 (Chapter 30) includes one chapter on database security, which \\nincludes a discussion of SQL commands for discretionary access control (GRANT, REVOKE), as well as mandatory security levels and models for including mandatory access control in relational databases, and a discussion of threats such as SQL injection attacks, as well as other techniques and methods related to data security and privacy.\\nAppendix A gives a number of alternative diagrammatic notations for displaying a \\nconceptual ER or EER schema. These may be substituted for the notation we use, if the instructor prefers. Appendix B gives some important physical parameters of disks. Appendix C gives an overview of the QBE graphical query language, and Appendixes D and E (available on the book’s Companion Website located at  http://www.pearsonhighered.com/elmasri) cover legacy database systems, based on the hierarchical and network database models. They have been used for more than thirty years as a basis for many commercial database applications and transaction-processing systems. Preface  xi'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 12}, page_content='Guidelines for Using This Book\\nThere are many different ways to teach a database course. The chapters in Parts 1 \\nthrough 7 can be used in an introductory course on database systems in the order that they are given or in the preferred order of individual instructors. Selected chap-ters and sections may be left out and the instructor can add other chapters from the rest of the book, depending on the emphasis of the course. At the end of the open-ing section of some of the book’s chapters, we list sections that are candidates for being left out whenever a less-detailed discussion of the topic is desired. We suggest covering up to Chapter 15 in an introductory database course and including selected parts of other chapters, depending on the background of the students and the desired coverage. For an emphasis on system implementation techniques, chapters from Parts 7, 8, and 9 should replace some of the earlier chapters.\\nChapters 3 and 4, which cover conceptual modeling using the ER and EER models, \\nare important for a good conceptual understanding of databases. However, they may be partially covered, covered later in a course, or even left out if the emphasis is on DBMS implementation. Chapters 16 and 17 on file organizations and indexing \\nmay also be covered early, later, or even left out if the emphasis is on database mod-\\nels and languages. For students who have completed a course on file organization, \\nparts of these chapters can be assigned as reading material or some exercises can be \\nassigned as a review for these concepts.\\nIf the emphasis of a course is on database design, then the instructor should cover \\nChapters 3 and 4 early on, followed by the presentation of relational databases. A total life-cycle database design and implementation project would cover conceptual design (Chapters 3 and 4), relational databases (Chapters 5, 6, and 7), data model mapping (Chapter 9), normalization (Chapter 14), and application programs implementation with SQL (Chapter 10). Chapter 11 also should be covered if the emphasis is on Web database programming and applications. Additional documen-tation on the specific programming languages and RDBMS used would be required. \\nThe book is written so that it is possible to cover topics in various sequences. The \\nfollowing chapter dependency chart shows the major dependencies among chap-ters. As the diagram illustrates, it is possible to start with several different topics following the first two introductory chapters. Although the chart may seem com-plex, it is important to note that if the chapters are covered in order, the dependen-cies are not lost. The chart can be consulted by instructors wishing to use an \\nalternative order of presentation.\\nFor a one-semester course based on this book, selected chapters can be assigned as \\nreading material. The book also can be used for a two-semester course sequence. The first course, Introduction to Database Design and Database Systems , at the \\nsophomore, junior, or senior level, can cover most of Chapters 1 through 15. The second course, Database Models and Implementation Techniques , at the senior or \\nfirst-year graduate level, can cover most of Chapters 16 through 30. The two-semester sequence can also be designed in various other ways, depending on the preferences of the instructors.xii Preface'),\n",

For example, if we go to the bank to deposit or withdraw funds, if we make a hotel or airline reservation, if we access a computerized library catalog to search for a bibliographic item, or if we purchase something online—such as a book, toy, or computer—chances are that our activities will involve someone or some computer program accessing a database. Even purchasing items at a supermarket often auto-matically updates the database that holds the inventory of grocery items.\\nThese interactions are examples of what we may call traditional database \\n applications , in which most of the information that is stored and accessed is either \\ntextual or numeric. In the past few years, advances in technology have led to exciting new applications of database systems. The proliferation of social media Web sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr, among many others, has required the cre-ation of huge databases that store nontraditional data, such as posts, tweets, images, and video clips. New types of database systems, often referred to as big data  \\nstorage systems, or NOSQL systems , have been created to manage data for social \\nmedia applications. These types of systems are also used by companies such as Google, Amazon, and Yahoo, to manage the data required in their Web search engines, as well as to provide cloud storage , whereby users are provided with stor-\\nage capabilities on the Web for managing all types of data including documents, programs, images, videos and emails. We will give an overview of these new types of database systems in Chapter 24.\\nWe now mention some other applications of databases. The wide availability of \\nphoto and video technology on cellphones and other devices has made it possible to'),\n",

These types of files are becom-\\ning an important component of multimedia databases . Geographic information \\nsystems (GISs)  can store and analyze maps, weather data, and satellite images. \\nData warehouses  and online analytical processing (OLAP)  systems are used in \\nmany companies to extract and analyze useful business information from very large databases to support decision making. Real-time  and active database technology  \\nis used to control industrial and manufacturing processes. And database search \\ntechniques  are being applied to the World Wide Web to improve the search for \\ninformation that is needed by users browsing the Internet.\\nTo understand the fundamentals of database technology, however, we must start \\nfrom the basics of traditional database applications. In Section 1.1 we start by defin-ing a database, and then we explain other basic terms. In Section 1.2, we provide a simple UNIVERSITY database example to illustrate our discussion. Section 1.3 describes some of the main characteristics of database systems, and Sections 1.4 and 1.5 categorize the types of personnel whose jobs involve using and interacting with database systems. Sections 1.6, 1.7, and 1.8 offer a more thorough discussion of the various capabilities provided by database systems and discuss some typical database applications. Section 1.9 summarizes the chapter.\\nThe reader who desires a quick introduction to database systems can study \\n Sections 1.1 through 1.5, then skip or browse through Sections 1.6 through 1.8 and go on to Chapter 2.\\n1.1 Introduction\\nDatabases and database technology have had a major impact on the growing use of computers. It is fair to say that databases play a critical role in almost all areas where computers are used, including business, electronic commerce, social media, engi-neering, medicine, genetics, law, education, and library science. The word database  \\nis so commonly used that we must begin by defining what a database is. Our initial definition is quite general.\\nA database  is a collection of related data.\\n1 By data , we mean known facts that can \\nbe recorded and that have implicit meaning. For example, consider the names, telephone numbers, and addresses of the people you know. Nowadays, this data is typically stored in mobile phones, which have their own simple database software. \\nThis data can also be recorded in an indexed address book or stored on a hard drive, using a personal computer and software such as Microsoft Access or Excel. This collection of related data with an implicit meaning is a database.\\nThe preceding definition of database is quite general; for example, we may consider \\nthe collection of words that make up this page of text to be related data and hence to \\n1We will use the word data as both singular and plural, as is common in database literature; the context \\nwill determine whether it is singular or plural. In standard English, data is used for plural and datum  for \\nsingular.'),\n",

A database has the following implicit properties:\\n■ A database represents some aspect of the real world, sometimes called the \\nminiworld  or the universe of discourse (UoD) . Changes to the miniworld \\nare reflected in the database.\\n■ A database is a logically coherent collection of data with some inherent \\nmeaning. A random assortment of data cannot correctly be referred to as a database.\\n■ A database is designed, built, and populated with data for a specific purpose. \\nIt has an intended group of users and some preconceived applications in which these users are interested.\\nIn other words, a database has some source from which data is derived, some degree \\nof interaction with events in the real world, and an audience that is actively inter-ested in its contents. The end users of a database may perform business transactions (for example, a customer buys a camera) or events may happen (for example, an employee has a baby) that cause the information in the database to change. In order for a database to be accurate and reliable at all times, it must be a true reflection of the miniworld that it represents; therefore, changes must be reflected in the data-base as soon as possible.\\nA database can be of any size and complexity. For example, the list of names and \\naddresses referred to earlier may consist of only a few hundred records, each with a simple structure. On the other hand, the computerized catalog of a large library may contain half a million entries organized under different categories—by pri-\\nmary author’s last name, by subject, by book title—with each category organized \\nalphabetically. A database of even greater size and complexity would be maintained by a social media company such as Facebook, which has more than a billion users. The database has to maintain information on which users are related to one another as friends,  the postings of each user, which users are allowed to see each posting, \\nand a vast amount of other types of information needed for the correct operation of their Web site. For such Web sites, a large number of databases are needed to keep track of the constantly changing information required by the social media Web site.\\nAn example of a large commercial database is Amazon.com. It contains data for \\nover 60 million active users, and millions of books, CDs, videos, DVDs, games, electronics, apparel, and other items. The database occupies over 42 terabytes (a\\xa0terabyte is 10\\n12 bytes worth of storage) and is stored on hundreds of computers \\n(called servers). Millions of visitors access Amazon.com each day and use the \\ndatabase to make purchases. The database is continually updated as new books \\nand other items are added to the inventory, and stock quantities are updated as \\npurchases are transacted.\\nA database may be generated and maintained manually or it may be computer-\\nized. For example, a library card catalog is a database that may be created and \\nmaintained manually. A computerized database may be created and maintained \\neither by a group of application programs written specifically for that task or by a'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 36}, page_content='6 Chapter 1 Databases and Database Users\\ndatabase management system. Of course, we are only concerned with computer-\\nized databases in this text.\\nA database management system (DBMS)  is a computerized system that enables \\nusers to create and maintain a database. The DBMS is a general-purpose software \\nsystem  that facilitates the processes of defining, constructing, manipulating,  and \\nsharing  databases among various users and applications. Defining  a database \\ninvolves specifying the data types, structures, and constraints of the data to be \\nstored in the database. The database definition or descriptive information is also stored by the DBMS in the form of a database catalog or dictionary; it is called meta-data . Constructing  the database is the process of storing the data on some \\nstorage medium that is controlled by the DBMS. Manipulating  a database includes \\nfunctions such as querying the database to retrieve specific data, updating the data-base to reflect changes in the miniworld, and generating reports from the data. Sharing  a database allows multiple users and programs to access the database \\nsimultaneously.\\nAn application program  accesses the database by sending queries or requests for \\ndata to the DBMS. A query\\n2 typically causes some data to be retrieved; a transaction  \\nmay cause some data to be read and some data to be written into the database.\\nOther important functions provided by the DBMS include protecting  the database \\nand maintaining  it over a long period of time. Protection  includes system protec-\\ntion against hardware or software malfunction (or crashes) and security protection  \\nagainst unauthorized or malicious access. A typical large database may have a life \\ncycle of many years, so the DBMS must be able to maintain  the database system by \\nallowing the system to evolve as requirements change over time.\\nIt is not absolutely necessary to use general-purpose DBMS software to implement \\na computerized database. It is possible to write a customized set of programs to cre-ate and maintain the database, in effect creating a special-purpose  DBMS software \\nfor a specific application, such as airlines reservations. In either case—whether we use a general-purpose DBMS or not—a considerable amount of complex software is deployed. In fact, most DBMSs are very complex software systems.\\nTo complete our initial definitions, we will call the database and DBMS software \\ntogether a database system . Figure 1.1 illustrates some of the concepts we have \\ndiscussed so far.\\n1.2 An Example\\nLet us consider a simple example that most readers may be familiar with: a \\n UNIVERSITY  database for maintaining information concerning students, courses, \\nand grades in a university environment. Figure 1.2 shows the database structure and a few sample data records. The database is organized as five files, each of which \\n2The term query , originally meaning a question or an inquiry, is sometimes loosely used for all types of \\ninteractions with databases, including modifying the data.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 37}, page_content='1.2 An Example  7\\nstores data records  of the same type.3 The STUDENT  file stores data on each stu-\\ndent, the COURSE  file stores data on each course, the SECTION  file stores data on \\neach section of a course, the GRADE_REPORT  file stores the grades that students \\nreceive in the various sections they have completed, and the PREREQUISITE  file \\nstores the prerequisites of each course.\\nTo define  this database, we must specify the structure of the records of each file by \\nspecifying the different types of data elements  to be stored in each record. In \\nFigure 1.2, each STUDENT  record includes data to represent the student’s Name , \\nStudent_number , Class  (such as freshman or ‘1’, sophomore or ‘2’, and so forth), \\nand Major (such as mathematics or ‘MATH’ and computer science or ‘CS’); each \\nCOURSE  record includes data to represent the Course_name, Course_number , \\nCredit_hours , and Department  (the department that offers the course), and so  \\non. We must also specify a data type  for each data element within a record. For \\nexample, we can specify that Name  of STUDENT  is a string of alphabetic characters, \\nStudent_number  of STUDENT  is an integer, and Grade of GRADE_REPORT  is a  \\n3We use the term file informally here.

We may also use a coding \\nscheme to represent the values of a data item. For example, in Figure 1.2 we rep-resent the \\nClass  of a STUDENT  as 1 for freshman, 2 for sophomore, 3 for junior,  \\n4 for senior, and 5 for graduate student.\\nTo construct  the UNIVERSITY  database, we store data to represent each student, \\ncourse, section, grade report, and prerequisite as a record in the appropriate file. Notice that records in the various files may be related. For example, the record for \\nSmith  in the STUDENT  file is related to two records in the GRADE_REPORT  file that \\nspecify Smith’s grades in two sections. Similarly, each record in the PREREQUISITE   \\nfile relates two course records: one representing the course and the other represent-ing the prerequisite. Most medium-size and large databases include many types of records and have many relationships  among the records.\\nDatabase manipulation  involves querying and updating. Examples of queries are as \\nfollows:\\n■ Retrieve the transcript—a list of all courses and grades—of ‘Smith’\\n■ List the names of students who took the section of the ‘Database’ course \\noffered in fall 2008 and their grades in that section\\n■ List the prerequisites of the ‘Database’ course\\nExamples of updates include the following:\\n■ Change the class of ‘Smith’ to sophomore\\n■ Create a new section for the ‘Database’ course for this semester\\n■ Enter a grade of ‘A’ for ‘Smith’ in the ‘Database’ section of last semester\\nThese informal queries and updates must be specified precisely in the query lan-\\nguage of the DBMS before they can be processed.\\nAt this stage, it is useful to describe the database as part of a larger undertaking \\nknown as an information system within an organization. The Information Tech-nology (IT) department within an organization designs and maintains an informa-tion system consisting of various computers, storage systems, application software, and databases. Design of a new application for an existing database or design of a brand new database starts off with a phase called requirements specification and \\nanalysis . These requirements are documented in detail and transformed into a \\n conceptual design  that can be represented and manipulated using some comput-\\nerized tools so that it can be easily maintained, modified, and transformed into a \\ndatabase implementation. (We will introduce a model called the Entity-Relation-ship model in Chapter 3 that is used for this purpose.) The design is then translated to a logical design  that can be expressed in a data model implemented in a com-\\nmercial DBMS. (Various types of DBMSs are discussed throughout the text, with an emphasis on relational DBMSs in Chapters 5 through 9.)\\nThe final stage is physical design , during which further specifications are provided for \\nstoring and accessing the database. The database design is implemented, populated with actual data, and continuously maintained to reflect the state of the miniworld.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 40}, page_content='10 Chapter 1 Databases and Database Users\\n1.3 Characteristics of the Database Approach\\nA number of characteristics distinguish the database approach from the much \\nolder approach of writing customized programs to access data stored in files. In traditional file processing , each user defines and implements the files needed for a \\nspecific software application as part of programming the application. For example, one user, the grade reporting office,  may keep files on students and their grades. \\nPrograms to print a student’s transcript and to enter new grades are implemented as part of the application. A second user, the accounting office , may keep track of \\nstudents’ fees and their payments. Although both users are interested in data about \\nstudents, each user maintains separate files—and programs to manipulate these \\nfiles—because each requires some data not available from the other user’s files. \\nThis redundancy in defining and storing data results in wasted storage space and \\nin redundant efforts to maintain common up-to-date data.\\nIn the database approach, a single repository maintains data that is defined once \\nand then accessed by various users repeatedly through queries, transactions, and \\napplication programs. The main characteristics of the database approach versus the \\nfile-processing approach are the following:\\n■ Self-describing nature of a database system\\n■ Insulation between programs and data, and data abstraction\\n■ Support of multiple views of the data\\n■ Sharing of data and multiuser transaction processing\\nWe describe each of these characteristics in a separate section. We will discuss addi-\\ntional characteristics of database systems in Sections 1.6 through 1.8.\\n1.3.1 Self-Describing Nature of a Database System\\nA fundamental characteristic of the database approach is that the database system contains not only the database itself but also a complete definition or description of the database structure and constraints. This definition is stored in the DBMS cata-log, which contains information such as the structure of each file, the type and stor-age format of each data item, and various constraints on the data. The information stored in the catalog is called meta-data , and it describes the structure of the pri-\\nmary database (Figure 1.1). It is important to note that some newer types of data-\\nbase systems, known as NOSQL systems, do not require meta-data. Rather the data is stored as self-describing data  that includes the data item names and data values \\ntogether in one structure (see Chapter 24).\\nThe catalog is used by the DBMS software and also by database users who need \\ninformation about the database structure. A general-purpose DBMS software package is not written for a specific database application. Therefore, it must refer to the catalog to know the structure of the files in a specific database, such as the type and format of data it will access. The DBMS software must work equally well with any number of database applications— for example, a university database, a'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 41}, page_content='1.3 Characteristics of the Database Approach  11\\nbanking database, or a company database—as long as the database definition is \\nstored in the catalog.\\nIn traditional file processing, data definition is typically part of the application pro-\\ngrams themselves. Hence, these programs are constrained to work with only one \\nspecific database,  whose structure is declared in the application programs. For \\nexample, an application program written in C++ may have struct or class declara-\\ntions. Whereas file-processing software can access only specific databases, DBMS \\nsoftware can access diverse databases by extracting the database definitions from the catalog and using these definitions.\\nFor the example shown in Figure 1.2, the DBMS catalog will store the definitions of \\nall the files shown. Figure 1.3 shows some entries in a database catalog. Whenever a request is made to access, say, the \\nName  of a STUDENT  record, the DBMS software \\nrefers to the catalog to determine the structure of the STUDENT  file and the position \\nand size of the Name  data item within a STUDENT  record. By contrast, in a typical \\nfile-processing application, the file structure and, in the extreme case, the exact location of \\nName  within a STUDENT  record are already coded within each program \\nthat accesses this data item.\\nFigure 1.3 \\nAn example of a  database catalog for \\nthe database in  Figure 1.2.Relation_name No_of_columns\\nSTUDENT 4\\nCOURSE 4\\nSECTION 5\\nGRADE_REPORT 3\\nPREREQUISITE 2\\nColumn_name Data_type Belongs_to_relation\\nName Character (30) STUDENT\\nStudent_number Character (4) STUDENT\\nClass Integer (1) STUDENT\\nMajor Major_type STUDENT\\nCourse_name Character (10) COURSE\\nCourse_number XXXX NNNN COURSE\\n…. …. …..\\n…. …. …..\\n…. …. …..\\nPrerequisite_number XXXX NNNN PREREQUISITERELATIONS\\nCOLUMNS\\nNote: Major_type is defined as an enumerated type with all known majors.  \\nXXXX NNNN is used to define a type with four alphabetic characters followed by four numeric digits.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 42}, page_content='12 Chapter 1 Databases and Database Users\\n1.3.2  Insulation between Programs and Data,  \\nand Data Abstraction\\nIn traditional file processing, the structure of data files is embedded in the applica-\\ntion programs, so any changes to the structure of a file may require changing all \\nprograms  that access that file. By contrast, DBMS access programs do not require \\nsuch changes in most cases. The structure of data files is stored in the DBMS cata-\\nlog separately from the access programs. We call this property program-data \\nindependence .\\nFor example, a file access program may be written in such a way that it can access \\nonly STUDENT  records of the structure shown in Figure 1.4. If we want to add \\nanother piece of data to each STUDENT  record, say the Birth_date , such a program \\nwill no longer work and must be changed. By contrast, in a DBMS environment, we only need to change the description  of \\nSTUDENT  records in the catalog (Figure 1.3) \\nto reflect the inclusion of the new data item Birth_date ; no programs are changed. \\nThe next time a DBMS program refers to the catalog, the new structure of  \\nSTUDENT  records will be accessed and used.\\nIn some types of database systems, such as object-oriented and object-relational \\nsystems (see Chapter 12), users can define operations on data as part of the database definitions. An operation  (also called a function  or method ) is specified in two \\nparts. The interface  (or signature ) of an operation includes the operation name and \\nthe data types of its arguments (or parameters). The implementation  (or method ) of \\nthe operation is specified separately and can be changed without affecting the inter-face. User application programs can operate on the data by invoking these opera-tions through their names and arguments, regardless of how the operations are \\nimplemented. This may be termed program-operation independence .\\nThe characteristic that allows program-data independence and program-operation \\nindependence is called data abstraction . A DBMS provides users with a conceptual \\nrepresentation  of data that does not include many of the details of how the data is \\nstored or how the operations are implemented. Informally, a data model  is a type of \\ndata abstraction that is used to provide this conceptual representation. The data \\nmodel uses logical concepts, such as objects, their properties, and their interrela-tionships, that may be easier for most users to understand than computer storage concepts. Hence, the data model hides  storage and implementation details that are \\nnot of interest to most database users.\\nLooking at the example in Figures 1.2 and 1.3, the internal implementation of the \\nSTUDENT file may be defined by its record length—the number of characters (bytes) in each record—and each data item may be specified by its starting byte within a record and its length in bytes. The \\nSTUDENT  record would thus be repre-\\nsented as shown in Figure 1.4. But a typical database user is not concerned with the location of each data item within a record or its length; rather, the user is concerned that when a reference is made to \\nName  of STUDENT , the correct value is returned.  \\nA conceptual representation of the STUDENT  records is shown in Figure 1.2. Many \\nother details of file storage organization—such as the access paths specified on a'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 43}, page_content='1.3 Characteristics of the Database Approach  13\\nfile—can be hidden from database users by the DBMS; we discuss storage details in \\nChapters 16 and 17.\\nIn the database approach, the detailed structure and organization of each file are \\nstored in the catalog. Database users and application programs refer to the concep-tual representation of the files, and the DBMS extracts the details of file storage from the catalog when these are needed by the DBMS file access modules. Many data models can be used to provide this data abstraction to database users. A major part of this text is devoted to presenting various data models and the concepts they use to abstract the representation of data.\\nIn object-oriented and object-relational databases, the abstraction process includes \\nnot only the data structure but also the operations on the data. These operations provide an abstraction of miniworld activities commonly understood by the users. For example, an operation \\nCALCULATE_GPA  can be applied to a STUDENT  object  \\nto calculate the grade point average. Such operations can be invoked by the user queries or application programs without having to know the details of how the operations are implemented.\\n1.3.3 Support of Multiple Views of the Data\\nA database typically has many types of users, each of whom may require a different perspective or view  of the database. A view may be a subset of the database or it may \\ncontain virtual data  that is derived from the database files but is not explicitly stored. \\nSome users may not need to be aware of whether the data they refer to is stored or derived. A multiuser DBMS whose users have a variety of distinct applications must provide facilities for defining multiple views. For example, one user of the database of Figure 1.2 may be interested only in accessing and printing the transcript of each student; the view for this user is shown in Figure 1.5(a). A second user, who is inter-\\nested only in checking that students have taken all the prerequisites of each course \\nfor which the student registers, may require the view shown in Figure 1.5(b).\\n1.3.4 Sharing of Data and Multiuser Transaction Processing\\nA multiuser DBMS, as its name implies, must allow multiple users to access the database at the same time. This is essential if data for multiple applications is to be \\nintegrated and maintained in a single database. The DBMS must include  concurrency \\ncontrol  software to ensure that several users trying to update the same data  Data Item Name Starting Position in Record Length in Characters (bytes)\\nName 1 30\\nStudent_number 31 4\\nClass 35 1\\nMajor 36 4Figure 1.4 \\nInternal storage format for a STUDENT record, based on the database catalog in Figure 1.3.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 44}, page_content='14 Chapter 1 Databases and Database Users\\ndo so in a controlled manner so that the result of the updates is correct. For exam-\\nple, when several reservation agents try to assign a seat on an airline flight, the DBMS should ensure that each seat can be accessed by only one agent at a time for assignment to a passenger. These types of applications are generally called online \\ntransaction processing (OLTP)  applications. A fundamental role of multiuser \\nDBMS software is to ensure that concurrent transactions operate correctly and efficiently.\\nThe concept of a transaction  has become central to many database applications. A \\ntransaction is an executing program  or process  that includes one or more database \\naccesses, such as reading or updating of database records. Each transaction is sup-posed to execute a logically correct database access if executed in its entirety with-out interference from other transactions. The DBMS must enforce several transaction properties. The isolation  property ensures that each transaction \\nappears to execute in isolation from other transactions, even though hundreds of \\ntransactions may be executing concurrently. The atomicity  property ensures that \\neither all the database operations in a transaction are executed or none are. We dis-\\ncuss transactions in detail in Part 9.\\nThe preceding characteristics are important in distinguishing a DBMS from tradi-\\ntional file-processing software. In Section 1.6 we discuss additional features that \\ncharacterize a DBMS. First, however, we categorize the different types of people \\nwho work in a database system environment.Student_nameStudent_transcript\\nCourse_number Grade Semester Year Section_id\\nSmithCS1310 C Fall 08 119\\nMATH2410 B Fall 08 112\\nBrownMATH2410 A Fall 07 85\\nCS1310 A Fall 07 92\\nCS3320 B Spring 08 102\\nCS3380 A Fall 08 135TRANSCRIPT\\nCourse_name Course_number Prerequisites\\nDatabase CS3380CS3320\\nMATH2410\\nData Structures CS3320 CS1310COURSE_PREREQ UISITES(a)\\n(b)\\nFigure 1.5 \\nTwo views derived from the database in Figure 1.2.

However, in large organizations, many people are involved in the design, use, and maintenance of a large database with hundreds or thousands of users. In this section we identify the people whose jobs involve the day-to-day use of a large database; we call them the actors on the scene . In Section 1.5 we consider \\npeople who may be called workers behind the scene —those who work to maintain \\nthe database system environment but who are not actively interested in the data-\\nbase contents as part of their daily job.\\n1.4.1 Database Administrators\\nIn any organization where many people use the same resources, there is a need for a chief administrator to oversee and manage these resources. In a database environ-ment, the primary resource is the database itself, and the secondary resource is the DBMS and related software. Administering these resources is the responsibility of \\nthe database administrator (DBA) . The DBA is responsible for authorizing access \\nto the database, coordinating and monitoring its use, and acquiring software and hardware resources as needed. The DBA is accountable for problems such as secu-rity breaches and poor system response time. In large organizations, the DBA is assisted by a staff that carries out these functions.\\n1.4.2 Database Designers\\nDatabase designers  are responsible for identifying the data to be stored in the data-\\nbase and for choosing appropriate structures to represent and store this data. These tasks are mostly undertaken before the database is actually implemented and popu-lated with data. It is the responsibility of database designers to communicate with all prospective database users in order to understand their requirements and to cre-ate a design that meets these requirements. In many cases, the designers are on the staff of the DBA and may be assigned other staff responsibilities after the database design is completed. Database designers typically interact with each potential group of users and develop views  of the database that meet the data and processing \\nrequirements of these groups. Each view is then analyzed and integrated  with the \\nviews of other user groups. The final database design must be capable of supporting the requirements of all user groups.\\n1.4.3 End Users\\nEnd users  are the people whose jobs require access to the database for querying, \\nupdating, and generating reports; the database primarily exists for their use. There are several categories of end users:\\n■ Casual end users  occasionally access the database, but they may need differ-\\nent information each time. They use a sophisticated database query interface'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 46}, page_content='16 Chapter 1 Databases and Database Users\\nto specify their requests and are typically middle- or high-level managers or \\nother occasional browsers.\\n■ Naive  or parametric end users  make up a sizable portion of database \\nend users. Their main job function revolves around constantly querying and updating the database, using standard types of queries and updates—called canned transactions —that have been carefully programmed and \\ntested. Many of these tasks are now available as mobile apps  for use with \\nmobile devices. The tasks that such users perform are varied. A few examples are:\\n/box4 Bank customers and tellers check account balances and post withdrawals \\nand deposits.\\n/box4 Reservation agents or customers for airlines, hotels, and car rental com-\\npanies check availability for a given request and make reservations.\\n/box4 Employees at receiving stations for shipping companies enter package \\nidentifications via bar codes and descriptive information through buttons to update a central database of received and in-transit packages.\\n/box4 Social media users post and read items on social media Web sites.\\n■ Sophisticated end users  include engineers, scientists, business analysts, and \\nothers who thoroughly familiarize themselves with the facilities of the DBMS \\nin order to implement their own applications to meet their complex require-\\nments.\\n■ Standalone users  maintain personal databases by using ready-made pro-\\ngram packages that provide easy-to-use menu-based or graphics-based \\ninterfaces. An example is the user of a financial software package that stores \\na variety of personal financial data.\\nA typical DBMS provides multiple facilities to access a database. Naive end users \\nneed to learn very little about the facilities provided by the DBMS; they simply have \\nto understand the user interfaces of the mobile apps or standard transactions designed and implemented for their use. Casual users learn only a few facilities that they may use repeatedly. Sophisticated users try to learn most of the DBMS facilities in order to achieve their complex requirements. Standalone users typically become very proficient in using a specific software package.\\n1.4.4  System Analysts and Application Programmers  \\n(Software Engineers)\\nSystem analysts  determine the requirements of end users, especially naive and \\nparametric end users, and develop specifications for standard canned transactions \\nthat meet these requirements. Application programmers  implement these specifi-\\ncations as programs; then they test, debug, document, and maintain these canned \\ntransactions. Such analysts and programmers—commonly referred to as software \\ndevelopers  or software engineers —should be familiar with the full range of capa-\\nbilities provided by the DBMS to accomplish their tasks.'),\n",

These persons are typically not interested in the database content \\nitself. We call them the workers behind the scene , and they include the following \\ncategories:\\n■ DBMS system designers and implementers  design and implement the \\nDBMS modules and interfaces as a software package. A DBMS is a very complex software system that consists of many components, or modules , \\nincluding modules for implementing the catalog, query language process-ing, interface processing, accessing and buffering data, controlling concur-rency, and handling data recovery and security. The DBMS must interface with other system software, such as the operating system and compilers for various programming languages.\\n■ Tool developers  design and implement tools —the software packages that \\nfacilitate database modeling and design, database system design, and improved performance. Tools are optional packages that are often pur-chased separately. They include packages for database design, performance monitoring, natural language or graphical interfaces, prototyping, simula-tion, and test data generation. In many cases, independent software vendors develop and market these tools.\\n■ Operators and maintenance personnel  (system administration personnel) \\nare responsible for the actual running and maintenance of the hardware and software environment for the database system.\\nAlthough these categories of workers behind the scene are instrumental in making \\nthe database system available to end users, they typically do not use the database contents for their own purposes.\\n1.6 Advantages of Using the DB MS Approach\\nIn this section we discuss some additional advantages of using a DBMS and the \\ncapabilities that a good DBMS should possess. These capabilities are in addition to the four main characteristics discussed in Section 1.3. The DBA must utilize these capabilities to accomplish a variety of objectives related to the design, administra-tion, and use of a large multiuser database.\\n1.6.1 Controlling Redundancy\\nIn traditional software development utilizing file processing, every user group maintains its own files for handling its data-processing applications. For example, consider the \\nUNIVERSITY  database example of Section 1.2; here, two groups of  \\nusers might be the course registration personnel and the accounting office. In the traditional approach, each group independently keeps files on students. The'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 48}, page_content='18 Chapter 1 Databases and Database Users\\naccounting office keeps data on registration and related billing information, \\nwhereas the registration office keeps track of student courses and grades. Other groups may further duplicate some or all of the same data in their own files.\\nThis redundancy  in storing the same data multiple times leads to several problems. \\nFirst, there is the need to perform a single logical update—such as entering data on a new student—multiple times: once for each file where student data is recorded. This leads to duplication of effort.  Second, storage space is wasted  when the same \\ndata is stored repeatedly, and this problem may be serious for large databases. Third, files that represent the same data may become inconsistent.  This may happen \\nbecause an update is applied to some of the files but not to others. Even if an update—such as adding a new student—is applied to all the appropriate files, the data concerning the student may still be inconsistent  because the updates are applied \\nindependently by each user group. For example, one user group may enter a stu-dent’s birth date erroneously as ‘JAN-19-1988’, whereas the other user groups may enter the correct value of ‘JAN-29-1988’.\\nIn the database approach, the views of different user groups are integrated during \\ndatabase design. Ideally, we should have a database design that stores each logical data item—such as a student’s name or birth date—in only one place  in the data-\\nbase. This is known as data normalization , and it ensures consistency and saves \\nstorage space (data normalization is described in Part 6 of the text).\\nHowever, in practice, it is sometimes necessary to use controlled redundancy  to \\nimprove the performance of queries. For example, we may store \\nStudent_name  and \\nCourse_number  redundantly in a GRADE_REPORT  file (Figure 1.6(a)) because  \\nwhenever we retrieve a GRADE_REPORT  record, we want to retrieve the student \\nname and course number along with the grade, student number, and section identi-\\nfier. By placing all the data together, we do not have to search multiple files to col-\\nlect this data. This is known as denormalization . In such cases, the DBMS should \\nStudent_number Student_name Section_identifier Course_number Grade\\n17 Smith 112 MATH2410 B\\n17 Smith 119 CS1310 C\\n8 Brown 85 MATH2410 A\\n8 Brown 92 CS1310 A\\n8 Brown 102 CS3320 B\\n8 Brown 135 CS3380 AGRADE_REPORT\\nStudent_number Student_name Section_identifier Course_number Grade\\n17 Brown 112 MATH2410 BGRADE_REPORT(a)\\n(b)Figure 1.6 \\nRedundant storage of Student_name and Course_name in  \\nGRADE_REPORT.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 49}, page_content='1.6 Advantages of Using the DBMS Approach  19\\nhave the capability to control  this redundancy in order to prohibit inconsisten-\\ncies among the files. This may be done by automatically checking that the  \\nStudent_name–Student_number  values in any GRADE_REPORT  record in Fig- \\nure 1.6(a) match one of the Name–Student_number  values of a STUDENT  record (Fig- \\nure 1.2). Similarly, the Section_identifier–Course_number  values in GRADE_REPORT  \\ncan be checked against SECTION  records. Such checks can be specified to the DBMS \\nduring database design and automatically enforced by the DBMS whenever the \\nGRADE_REPORT  file is updated. Figure 1.6(b) shows a GRADE_REPORT  record that \\nis inconsistent with the STUDENT  file in Figure 1.2; this kind of error may be entered \\nif the redundancy is not controlled.  Can you tell which part is inconsistent?\\n1.6.2 Restricting Unauthorized Access\\nWhen multiple users share a large database, it is likely that most users will not be \\nauthorized to access all information in the database. For example, financial data such as salaries and bonuses is often considered confidential, and only autho-rized persons are allowed to access such data. In addition, some users may only be permitted to retrieve data, whereas others are allowed to retrieve and update. Hence, the type of access operation—retrieval or update—must also be con-trolled. Typically, users or user groups are given account numbers protected by passwords, which they can use to gain access to the database. A DBMS should provide a security and authorization subsystem , which the DBA uses to create \\naccounts and to specify account restrictions. Then, the DBMS should enforce these restrictions automatically. Notice that we can apply similar controls to the DBMS software. For example, only the DBA’s staff may be allowed to use certain privileged software , such as the software for creating new accounts. Similarly, \\nparametric users may be allowed to access the database only through the pre-defined apps or canned transactions developed for their use. We discuss data-base security and authorization in Chapter 30.\\n1.6.3 Providing Persistent Storage for Program Objects\\nDatabases can be used to provide persistent storage  for program objects and data \\nstructures. This is one of the main reasons for object-oriented database systems  \\n(see Chapter 12). Programming languages typically have complex data structures, \\nsuch as structs or class definitions in C++ or Java. The values of program variables or objects are discarded once a program terminates, unless the programmer explic-itly stores them in permanent files, which often involves converting these complex structures into a format suitable for file storage. When the need arises to read this data once more, the programmer must convert from the file format to the program variable or object structure. Object-oriented database systems are compatible with programming languages such as C++ and Java, and the DBMS software auto-matically performs any necessary conversions. Hence, a complex object in C++ can be stored permanently in an object-oriented DBMS. Such an object is said to \\nbe persistent , since it survives the termination of program execution and can \\nlater be directly retrieved by another program.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 50}, page_content='20 Chapter 1 Databases and Database Users\\nThe persistent storage of program objects and data structures is an important func-\\ntion of database systems. Traditional database systems often suffered from the so-called impedance mismatch problem , since the data structures provided by the \\nDBMS were incompatible with the programming language’s data structures. Object-oriented database systems typically offer data structure compatibility  with \\none or more object-oriented programming languages.\\n1.6.4  Providing Storage Structures and Search  \\nTechniques for Efficient Query Processing\\nDatabase systems must provide capabilities for efficiently executing queries and \\nupdates.  Because the database is typically stored on disk, the DBMS must provide \\nspecialized data structures and search techniques to speed up disk search for the desired records. Auxiliary files called indexes  are often used for this purpose. \\nIndexes are typically based on tree data structures or hash data structures that are suitably modified for disk search. In order to process the database records needed by a particular query, those records must be copied from disk to main memory. Therefore, the DBMS often has a buffering  or caching  module that maintains parts \\nof the database in main memory buffers. In general, the operating system is respon-sible for disk-to-memory buffering. However, because data buffering is crucial to the DBMS performance, most DBMSs do their own data buffering.\\nThe query processing and optimization  module of the DBMS is responsible for \\nchoosing an efficient query execution plan for each query based on the existing storage structures. The choice of which indexes to create and maintain is part of physical database design and tuning,  which is one of the responsibilities of the DBA \\nstaff. We discuss query processing and optimization in Part 8 of the text.\\n1.6.5 Providing Backup and Recovery\\nA DBMS must provide facilities for recovering from hardware or software failures. The backup and recovery subsystem  of the DBMS is responsible for recovery. For \\nexample, if the computer system fails in the middle of a complex update transac-tion, the recovery subsystem is responsible for making sure that the database is restored to the state it was in before the transaction started executing. Disk backup is also necessary in case of a catastrophic disk failure. We discuss recovery and backup in Chapter 22.\\n1.6.6 Providing Multiple User Interfaces\\nBecause many types of users with varying levels of technical knowledge use a data-base, a DBMS should provide a variety of user interfaces. These include apps for mobile users, query languages for casual users, programming language interfaces for application programmers, forms and command codes for parametric users, and menu-driven interfaces and natural language interfaces for standalone users. Both forms-style interfaces and menu-driven interfaces are commonly known as'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 51}, page_content='1.6 Advantages of Using the DBMS Approach  21\\ngraphical user interfaces (GUIs) . Many specialized languages and environments \\nexist for specifying GUIs. Capabilities for providing Web GUI interfaces to a database—or Web-enabling a database—are also quite common.\\n1.6.7 Representing Complex Relationships among Data\\nA database may include numerous varieties of data that are interrelated in many ways. Consider the example shown in Figure 1.2. The record for ‘Brown’ in the \\nSTUDENT  file is related to four records in the GRADE_REPORT  file. Similarly, \\neach section record is related to one course record and to a number of  \\nGRADE_REPORT  records—one for each student who completed that section. A \\nDBMS must have the capability to represent a variety of complex relationships among the data, to define new relationships as they arise, and to retrieve and update related data easily and efficiently.\\n1.6.8 Enforcing Integrity Constraints\\nMost database applications have certain integrity constraints  that must hold for \\nthe data. A DBMS should provide capabilities for defining and enforcing these \\nconstraints. The simplest type of integrity constraint involves specifying a data \\ntype for each data item. For example, in Figure 1.3, we specified that the value of \\nthe Class  data item within each STUDENT  record must be a one-digit integer and \\nthat the value of Name  must be a string of no more than 30 alphabetic characters. \\nTo restrict the value of Class  between 1 and 5 would be an additional constraint \\nthat is not shown in the current catalog. A more complex type of constraint that \\nfrequently occurs involves specifying that a record in one file must be related to \\nrecords in other files. For example, in Figure 1.2, we can specify that every section \\nrecord must be related to a course record . This is known as a referential integrity  \\nconstraint. Another type of constraint specifies uniqueness on data item values, such as every course record must have a unique value for \\nCourse_number . This is \\nknown as a key or uniqueness  constraint. These constraints are derived from the \\nmeaning or semantics  of the data and of the miniworld it represents. It is the \\nresponsibility of the database designers to identify integrity constraints during \\ndatabase design. Some constraints can be specified to the DBMS and automatically enforced. Other constraints may have to be checked by update programs or at the time of data entry. For typical large applications, it is customary to call such con-straints business rules .\\nA data item may be entered erroneously and still satisfy the specified integrity con-\\nstraints. For example, if a student receives a grade of ‘A’ but a grade of ‘C’ is entered in the database, the DBMS cannot  discover this error automatically because ‘C’ is a \\nvalid value for the \\nGrade  data type. Such data entry errors can only be discovered \\nmanually (when the student receives the grade and complains) and corrected later \\nby updating the database. However, a grade of ‘Z’ would be rejected automatically \\nby the DBMS because ‘Z’ is not a valid value for the Grade  data type. When we dis-\\ncuss each data model in subsequent chapters, we will introduce rules that pertain to'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 52}, page_content='22 Chapter 1 Databases and Database Users\\nthat model implicitly. For example, in the Entity-Relationship model in Chapter 3, \\na relationship must involve at least two entities. Rules that pertain to a specific data model are called inherent rules  of the data model.\\n1.6.9  Permitting Inferencing and Actions  \\nUsing Rules and Triggers\\nSome database systems provide capabilities for defining deduction rules  for infer-\\nencing  new information from the stored database facts. Such systems are called \\ndeductive database systems . For example, there may be complex rules in the mini-\\nworld application for determining when a student is on probation. These can be specified declaratively  as rules , which when compiled and maintained by the DBMS \\ncan determine all students on probation. In a traditional DBMS, an explicit proce-\\ndural program code  would have to be written to support such applications. But if \\nthe miniworld rules change, it is generally more convenient to change the declared deduction rules than to recode procedural programs. In today’s relational database systems, it is possible to associate triggers  with tables. A trigger is a form of a rule \\nactivated by updates to the table, which results in performing some additional oper-ations to some other tables, sending messages, and so on. More involved proce-dures to enforce rules are popularly called stored procedures ; they become a part of \\nthe overall database definition and are invoked appropriately when certain condi-\\ntions are met. More powerful functionality is provided by active database systems , \\nwhich provide active rules that can automatically initiate actions when certain events and conditions occur (see Chapter 26 for introductions to active databases in Section 26.1 and deductive databases in Section 26.5).\\n1.6.10  Additional Implications of Using  \\nthe Database Approach\\nThis section discusses a few additional implications of using the database approach \\nthat can benefit most organizations.\\nPotential for Enforcing Standards. The database approach permits the DBA to \\ndefine and enforce standards among database users in a large organization. This facil-\\nitates communication and cooperation among various departments, projects, and \\nusers within the organization. Standards can be defined for names and formats of data elements, display formats, report structures, terminology, and so on. The DBA can enforce standards in a centralized database environment more easily than in an environment where each user group has control of its own data files and software.\\nReduced Application Development Time. A prime selling feature of the data-\\nbase approach is that developing a new application—such as the retrieval of certain data from the database for printing a new report—takes very little time. Designing and implementing a large multiuser database from scratch may take more time than writing a single specialized file application. However, once a database is up and running, substantially less time is generally required to create new applications'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 53}, page_content='1.7 A Brief History of Database Applications  23\\nusing DBMS facilities. Development time using a DBMS is estimated to be one-\\nsixth to one-fourth of that for a file system.\\nFlexibility. It may be necessary to change the structure of a database as require-\\nments change. For example, a new user group may emerge that needs information not currently in the database. In response, it may be necessary to add a file to the database or to extend the data elements in an existing file. Modern DBMSs allow certain types of evolutionary changes to the structure of the database without affect-ing the stored data and the existing application programs.\\nAvailability of Up-to-Date Information. A DBMS makes the database available \\nto all users. As soon as one user’s update is applied to the database, all other users can immediately see this update. This availability of up-to-date information is essential for many transaction-processing applications, such as reservation systems or banking databases, and it is made possible by the concurrency control and recov-ery subsystems of a DBMS.\\nEconomies of Scale. The DBMS approach permits consolidation of data and \\napplications, thus reducing the amount of wasteful overlap between activities of data-processing personnel in different projects or departments as well as redundan-cies among applications. This enables the whole organization to invest in more powerful processors, storage devices, or networking gear, rather than having each department purchase its own (lower performance) equipment. This reduces overall \\ncosts of operation and management.\\n1.7 A Brief History of Database Applications\\nWe now give a brief historical overview of the applications that use DBMSs and how these applications provided the impetus for new types of database systems.\\n1.7.1  Early Database Applications Using Hierarchical  \\nand Network Systems\\nMany early database applications maintained records in large organizations such as \\ncorporations, universities, hospitals, and banks. In many of these applications, there were large numbers of records of similar structure. For example, in a univer-sity application, similar information would be kept for each student, each course, each grade record, and so on. There were also many types of records and many interrelationships among them.\\nOne of the main problems with early database systems was the intermixing of con-\\nceptual relationships with the physical storage and placement of records on disk. Hence, these systems did not provide sufficient data abstraction  and program-data \\nindependence  capabilities. For example, the grade records of a particular student \\ncould be physically stored next to the student record. Although this provided very'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 54}, page_content='24 Chapter 1 Databases and Database Users\\nefficient access for the original queries and transactions that the database was \\ndesigned to handle, it did not provide enough flexibility to access records efficiently when new queries and transactions were identified. In particular, new queries that required a different storage organization for efficient processing were quite difficult to implement efficiently. It was also laborious to reorganize the database when changes were made to the application’s requirements.\\nAnother shortcoming of early systems was that they provided only programming \\nlanguage interfaces. This made it time-consuming and expensive to implement new queries and transactions, since new programs had to be written, tested, and debugged. Most of these database systems were implemented on large and expensive mainframe computers starting in the mid-1960s and continuing through the 1970s and 1980s. The main types of early systems were based on three main paradigms: hierarchical systems, network model–based systems, and inverted file systems.\\n1.7.2  Providing Data Abstraction and Application Flexibility  \\nwith Relational Databases\\nRelational databases were originally proposed to separate the physical storage of \\ndata from its conceptual representation and to provide a mathematical foundation \\nfor data representation and querying. The relational data model also introduced \\nhigh-level query languages that provided an alternative to programming language \\ninterfaces, making it much faster to write new queries. Relational representation of data somewhat resembles the example we presented in Figure 1.2. Relational sys-tems were initially targeted to the same applications as earlier systems, and pro-\\nvided flexibility to develop new queries quickly and to reorganize the database as \\nrequirements changed. Hence, data abstraction  and program-data independence  \\nwere much improved when compared to earlier systems.\\nEarly experimental relational systems developed in the late 1970s and the com-\\nmercial relational database management systems (RDBMS) introduced in the \\nearly 1980s were quite slow, since they did not use physical storage pointers or record placement to access related data records. With the development of new storage and indexing techniques and better query processing and optimization, their performance improved. Eventually, relational databases became the domi-nant type of database system for traditional database applications. Relational data-\\nbases now exist on almost all types of computers, from small personal computers to large servers.\\n1.7.3  Object-Oriented Applications and the Need  \\nfor More Complex Databases\\nThe emergence of object-oriented programming languages in the 1980s and the \\nneed to store and share complex, structured objects led to the development of \\nobject-oriented databases (OODBs). Initially, OODBs were considered a competitor'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 55}, page_content='1.7 A Brief History of Database Applications  25\\nto relational databases, since they provided more general data structures. They also \\nincorporated many of the useful object-oriented paradigms, such as abstract data types, encapsulation of operations, inheritance, and object identity. However, the complexity of the model and the lack of an early standard contributed to their lim-ited use. They are now mainly used in specialized applications, such as engineering design, multimedia publishing, and manufacturing systems. Despite expectations that they will make a big impact, their overall penetration into the database prod-ucts market remains low. In addition, many object-oriented concepts were incor-porated into the newer versions of relational DBMSs, leading to object-relational database management systems, known as ORDBMSs.\\n1.7.4  Interchanging Data on the Web  \\nfor E-Commerce Using XML\\nThe World Wide Web provides a large network of interconnected computers. \\nUsers can create static Web pages using a Web publishing language, such as Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML), and store these documents on Web servers where other users (clients) can access them and view them through Web browsers. Docu-ments can be linked through hyperlinks , which are pointers to other documents. \\nStarting in the 1990s, electronic commerce (e-commerce) emerged as a major application on the Web. Much of the critical information on e-commerce Web pages is dynamically extracted data from DBMSs, such as flight information, prod-uct prices, and product availability. A variety of techniques were developed to allow the interchange of dynamically extracted data on the Web for display on Web pages. The eXtended Markup Language (XML) is one standard for interchanging data among various types of databases and Web pages. XML combines concepts from the models used in document systems with database modeling concepts. Chapter 13 is devoted to an overview of XML.\\n1.7.5  Extending Database Capabilities  \\nfor New Applications\\nThe success of database systems in traditional applications encouraged devel-\\nopers of other types of applications to attempt to use them. Such applications traditionally used their own specialized software and file and data structures. Database systems now offer extensions to better support the specialized require-ments for some of these applications. The following are some examples of these applications:\\n■ Scientific  applications that store large amounts of data resulting from scien-\\ntific experiments in areas such as high-energy physics, the mapping of the human genome, and the discovery of protein structures\\n■ Storage and retrieval of images , including scanned news or personal photo-\\ngraphs, satellite photographic images, and images from medical procedures \\nsuch as x-rays and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) tests'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 56}, page_content='26 Chapter 1 Databases and Database Users\\n■ Storage and retrieval of videos , such as movies, and video clips  from news \\nor personal digital cameras\\n■ Data mining  applications that analyze large amounts of data to search for \\nthe occurrences of specific patterns or relationships, and for identifying \\nunusual patterns in areas such as credit card fraud detection\\n■ Spatial  applications that store and analyze spatial locations of data, such as \\nweather information, maps used in geographical information systems, and automobile navigational systems\\n■ Time series  applications that store information such as economic data at \\nregular points in time, such as daily sales and monthly gross national product figures\\nIt was quickly apparent that basic relational systems were not very suitable for many \\nof these applications, usually for one or more of the following reasons:\\n■ More complex data structures were needed for modeling the application \\nthan the simple relational representation.\\n■ New data types were needed in addition to the basic numeric and character \\nstring types.\\n■ New operations and query language constructs were necessary to manipu-\\nlate the new data types.\\n■ New storage and indexing structures were needed for efficient searching on \\nthe new data types.\\nThis led DBMS developers to add functionality to their systems. Some functionality \\nwas general purpose, such as incorporating concepts from object-oriented data-bases into relational systems. Other functionality was special purpose, in the form of optional modules that could be used for specific applications. For example, users could buy a time series module to use with their relational DBMS for their time series application.\\n1.7.6  Emergence of Big Data Storage Systems  \\nand NOSQL Databases\\nIn the first decade of the twenty-first century, the proliferation of applications and \\nplatforms such as social media Web sites, large e-commerce companies, Web search \\nindexes, and cloud storage/backup led to a surge in the amount of data stored on \\nlarge databases and massive servers. New types of database systems were necessary \\nto manage these huge databases—systems that would provide fast search and \\nretrieval as well as reliable and safe storage of nontraditional types of data, such as \\nsocial media posts and tweets. Some of the requirements of these new systems were \\nnot compatible with SQL relational DBMSs (SQL is the standard data model and language for relational databases). The term NOSQL  is generally interpreted as Not \\nOnly SQL, meaning that in systems than manage large amounts of data, some of the data is stored using SQL systems, whereas other data would be stored using NOSQL, depending on the application requirements.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 57}, page_content='1.9 Summary  27\\n1.8 When Not to Use a DB MS\\nIn spite of the advantages of using a DBMS, there are a few situations in which a \\nDBMS may involve unnecessary overhead costs that would not be incurred in traditional file processing. The overhead costs of using a DBMS are due to the following:\\n■ High initial investment in hardware, software, and training\\n■ The generality that a DBMS provides for defining and processing data\\n■ Overhead for providing security, concurrency control, recovery, and integ-\\nrity functions\\nTherefore, it may be more desirable to develop customized database applications \\nunder the following circumstances:\\n■ Simple, well-defined database applications that are not expected to change \\nat all\\n■ Stringent, real-time requirements for some application programs that may \\nnot be met because of DBMS overhead\\n■ Embedded systems with limited storage capacity, where a general-purpose \\nDBMS would not fit\\n■ No multiple-user access to data\\nCertain industries and applications have elected not to use general-purpose \\nDBMSs. For example, many computer-aided design (CAD) tools used by mechan-ical and civil engineers have proprietary file and data management software that is geared for the internal manipulations of drawings and 3D objects. Similarly, communication and switching systems designed by companies like AT&T were early manifestations of database software that was made to run very fast with hierarchically organized data for quick access and routing of calls. GIS imple-mentations often implement their own data organization schemes for efficiently implementing functions related to processing maps, physical contours, lines, polygons, and so on.\\n1.9 Summary\\nIn this chapter we defined a database as a collection of related data, where data  \\nmeans recorded facts. A typical database represents some aspect of the real world and is used for specific purposes by one or more groups of users. A DBMS is a generalized software package for implementing and maintaining a computerized database. The database and software together form a database system. We identi-fied several characteristics that distinguish the database approach from traditional file-processing applications, and we discussed the main categories of database users, or the actors on the scene . We noted that in addition to database users, there \\nare several categories of support personnel, or workers behind the scene , in a data-\\nbase environment.'),\n",

The recent growth in the amount of data requiring storage has led to database systems with distributed architectures comprised of thousands of computers that manage the data stores. This evolution mirrors the trends in computing, where large cen-tralized mainframe computers are replaced by hundreds of distributed worksta-tions and personal computers connected via communications networks to various types of server machines—Web servers, database servers, file servers, application servers, and so on. The current cloud computing  environments consist of thou-\\nsands of large servers managing so-called big data  for users on the Web.\\nIn a basic client/server DBMS architecture, the system functionality is distributed \\nbetween two types of modules.\\n1 A client module  is typically designed so that it \\nwill run on a mobile device, user workstation, or personal computer (PC). Typi-cally, application programs and user interfaces that access the database run in the client module. Hence, the client module handles user interaction and provides the user-friendly interfaces such as apps for mobile devices, or forms- or menu-based GUIs (graphical user interfaces) for PCs. The other kind of module, called a server module , typically handles data storage, access, search, and other func-\\ntions. We discuss client/server architectures in more detail in Section 2.5. First, we must study more basic concepts that will give us a better understanding of modern database architectures.\\n1As we shall see in Section 2.5, there are variations on this simple two-tier  client/server architecture.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 62}, page_content='32 Chapter 2 Database System Concepts and Architecture\\nIn this chapter we present the terminology and basic concepts that will be used \\nthroughout the text. Section 2.1 discusses data models and defines the concepts of schemas and instances, which are fundamental to the study of database sys-tems. We discuss the three-schema DBMS architecture and data independence in Section 2.2; this provides a user’s perspective on what a DBMS is supposed to do. In Section 2.3 we describe the types of interfaces and languages that are typi-cally provided by a DBMS. Section 2.4 discusses the database system software environment. Section 2.5 gives an overview of various types of client/server architectures. Finally, Section 2.6 presents a classification of the types of DBMS packages. Section 2.7 summarizes the chapter.\\nThe material in Sections 2.4 through 2.6 provides detailed concepts that may be \\nconsidered as supplementary to the basic introductory material.\\n2.1 Data Models, Schemas, and Instances\\nOne fundamental characteristic of the database approach is that it provides some \\nlevel of data abstraction. Data abstraction  generally refers to the suppression of \\ndetails of data organization and storage, and the highlighting of the essential fea-tures for an improved understanding of data. One of the main characteristics of the database approach is to support data abstraction so that different users can perceive data at their preferred level of detail. A data model —a collection of concepts that \\ncan be used to describe the structure of a database—provides the necessary means to achieve this abstraction.\\n2 By structure of a database  we mean the data types, rela-\\ntionships, and constraints that apply to the data. Most data models also include a set of basic operations  for specifying retrievals and updates on the database.\\nIn addition to the basic operations provided by the data model, it is becoming more \\ncommon to include concepts in the data model to specify the dynamic aspect  or \\nbehavior  of a database application. This allows the database designer to specify a set \\nof valid user-defined operations that are allowed on the database objects.\\n3 An \\nexample of a user-defined operation could be COMPUTE_GPA , which can be  \\napplied to a STUDENT  object. On the other hand, generic operations to insert, \\ndelete, modify, or retrieve any kind of object are often included in the basic data \\nmodel operations . Concepts to specify behavior are fundamental to object-oriented \\ndata models (see Chapter 12) but are also being incorporated in more traditional data models. For example, object-relational models (see Chapter 12) extend the basic relational model to include such concepts, among others. In the basic relational data model, there is a provision to attach behavior to the relations in the form of persis-tent stored modules, popularly known as stored procedures (see Chapter 10).\\n2Sometimes the word model  is used to denote a specific database description, or schema—for example, \\nthe marketing data model . We will not use this interpretation.\\n3The inclusion of concepts to describe behavior reflects a trend whereby database design and software \\ndesign activities are increasingly being combined into a single activity. Traditionally, specifying behavior is associated with software design.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 63}, page_content='2.1 Data Models, Schemas, and Instances  33\\n2.1.1 Categories of Data Models\\nMany data models have been proposed, which we can categorize according to  \\nthe types of concepts they use to describe the database structure. High-level  or \\n conceptual data models  provide concepts that are close to the way many users per-\\nceive data, whereas low-level  or physical data models  provide concepts that describe \\nthe details of how data is stored on the computer storage media, typically magnetic disks. Concepts provided by physical data models are generally meant for computer specialists, not for end users. Between these two extremes is a class of representational  \\n(or implementation ) data models ,\\n4 which provide concepts that may be easily \\nunderstood by end users but that are not too far removed from the way data is orga-nized in computer storage. Representational data models hide many details of data storage on disk but can be implemented on a computer system directly.\\nConceptual data models use concepts such as entities, attributes, and relationships. \\nAn entity  represents a real-world object or concept, such as an employee or a project \\nfrom the miniworld that is described in the database. An attribute  represents some \\nproperty of interest that further describes an entity, such as the employee’s name or salary. A relationship  among two or more entities represents an association among \\nthe entities, for example, a works-on relationship between an employee and a project. Chapter 3 presents the entity–relationship model —a popular high-level \\nconceptual data model. Chapter 4 describes additional abstractions used for advanced modeling, such as generalization, specialization, and categories (union types).\\nRepresentational or implementation data models are the models used most fre-\\nquently in traditional commercial DBMSs. These include the widely used relational \\ndata model , as well as the so-called legacy data models—the network  and \\n hierarchical models —that have been widely used in the past. Part 3 of the text is \\ndevoted to the relational data model, and its constraints, operations, and languages.\\n5 \\nThe SQL standard for relational databases is described in Chapters 6 and 7. Repre-sentational data models represent data by using record structures and hence are sometimes called record-based data models .\\nWe can regard the object data model  as an example of a new family of higher-level \\nimplementation data models that are closer to conceptual data models. A standard for object databases called the ODMG object model has been proposed by the Object Data Management Group (ODMG). We describe the general characteristics of object databases and the object model proposed standard in Chapter 12. Object data models are also frequently utilized as high-level conceptual models, particu-\\nlarly in the software engineering domain.\\nPhysical data models describe how data is stored as files in the computer by repre-\\nsenting information such as record formats, record orderings, and access paths. An \\n4The term implementation data model  is not a standard term; we have introduced it to refer to the avail-\\nable data models in commercial database systems.\\n5A summary of the hierarchical and network data models is included in Appendices D and E. They are \\naccessible from the book’s Web site.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 64}, page_content='34 Chapter 2 Database System Concepts and Architecture\\naccess path  is a search structure that makes the search for particular database \\nrecords efficient, such as indexing or hashing. We discuss physical storage tech-niques and access structures in Chapters 16 and 17. An index  is an example of an \\naccess path that allows direct access to data using an index term or a keyword. It is similar to the index at the end of this text, except that it may be organized in a lin-ear, hierarchical (tree-structured), or some other fashion.\\nAnother class of data models is known as self-describing data models . The data \\nstorage in systems based on these models combines the description of the data with the data values themselves. In traditional DBMSs, the description (schema) is sepa-rated from the data. These models include XML  (see Chapter 12) as well as many of \\nthe key-value stores  and NOSQL systems  (see Chapter 24) that were recently cre-\\nated for managing big data.\\n2.1.2 Schemas, Instances, and Database State\\nIn a data model, it is important to distinguish between the description  of the \\ndatabase and the database itself . The description of a database is called the \\n database schema , which is specified during database design and is not expected \\nto change frequently.6 Most data models have certain conventions for displaying \\nschemas as diagrams.7 A displayed schema is called a schema diagram . Figure 2.1 \\nshows a schema diagram for the database shown in Figure 1.2; the diagram dis-\\nplays the structure of each record type but not the actual instances of records. \\n6Schema changes are usually needed as the requirements of the database applications change. Most \\ndatabase systems include operations for allowing schema changes.\\n7It is customary in database parlance to use schemas  as the plural for schema , even though schemata  is \\nthe proper plural form. The word scheme  is also sometimes used to refer to a schema.Section_identifier Semester Course_number Instructor YearSECTIONCourse_name Course_number Credit_hours DepartmentCOURSEName Student_number Class MajorSTUDENT\\nCourse_number Prerequisite_numberPREREQUISITE\\nStudent_number Grade Section_identifierGRADE_REPORTFigure 2.1 \\nSchema diagram for the database in  Figure 1.2.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 65}, page_content='2.1 Data Models, Schemas, and Instances  35\\nWe call each object in the schema—such as STUDENT  or COURSE —a schema \\nconstruct .\\nA schema diagram displays only some aspects  of a schema, such as the names of \\nrecord types and data items, and some types of constraints. Other aspects are not specified in the schema diagram; for example, Figure 2.1 shows neither the data type of each data item nor the relationships among the various files. Many types of constraints are not represented in schema diagrams. A constraint such as students \\nmajoring in computer science must take CS1310 before the end of their sophomore year  is quite difficult to represent diagrammatically.\\nThe actual data in a database may change quite frequently. For example, the data-\\nbase shown in Figure 1.2 changes every time we add a new student or enter a new grade. The data in the database at a particular moment in time is called a database \\nstate  or snapshot . It is also called the current  set of occurrences  or instances  in \\nthe database. In a given database state, each schema construct has its own current \\nset of instances; for example, the \\nSTUDENT  construct will contain the set of indi-\\nvidual student entities (records) as its instances. Many database states can be con-\\nstructed to correspond to a particular database schema. Every time we insert or \\ndelete a record or change the value of a data item in a record, we change one state of the database into another state.\\nThe distinction between database schema and database state is very important. \\nWhen we define  a new database, we specify its database schema only to the \\nDBMS. At this point, the corresponding database state is the empty state  with \\nno data. We get the initial state  of the database when the database is first \\n populated  or loaded  with the initial data. From then on, every time an update \\noperation is applied to the database, we get another database state. At any point \\nin time, the database has a current state .\\n8 The DBMS is partly responsible for \\nensuring that every state of the database is a valid state —that is, a state that \\nsatisfies the structure and constraints specified in the schema. Hence, specify-\\ning a correct schema to the DBMS is extremely important and the schema must \\nbe designed with utmost care. The DBMS stores the descriptions of the schema constructs and constraints—also called the meta-data —in the DBMS catalog so \\nthat DBMS software can refer to the schema whenever it needs to. The schema is sometimes called the intension , and a database state is called an extension  of \\nthe schema.\\nAlthough, as mentioned earlier, the schema is not supposed to change frequently, \\nit is not uncommon that changes occasionally need to be applied to the schema as the application requirements change. For example, we may decide that another data item needs to be stored for each record in a file, such as adding the Date_of_birth to the \\nSTUDENT  schema in Figure 2.1. This is known as schema evolution . Most \\nmodern DBMSs include some operations for schema evolution that can be applied \\nwhile the database is operational.\\n8The current state is also called the current snapshot  of the database. It has also been called a database \\ninstance , but we prefer to use the term instance  to refer to individual records.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 66}, page_content='36 Chapter 2 Database System Concepts and Architecture\\n2.2  Three-Schema Architecture  \\nand Data Independence\\nThree of the four important characteristics of the database approach, listed in \\nSection 1.3, are (1) use of a catalog to store the database description (schema) so as to make it self-describing, (2) insulation of programs and data (program-data and program-operation independence), and (3) support of multiple user views. In this section we specify an architecture for database systems, called the  three-schema architecture ,\\n9 that was proposed to help achieve and visualize \\nthese characteristics. Then we discuss further the concept of data independence.\\n2.2.1 The Three-Schema Architecture\\nThe goal of the three-schema architecture, illustrated in Figure 2.2, is to separate the user applications from the physical database. In this architecture, schemas can be defined at the following three levels:\\n \\n1. The internal level  has an internal schema , which describes the physical \\nstorage structure of the database. The internal schema uses a physical data model and describes the complete details of data storage and access paths for the database.\\n9This is also known as the ANSI/SPARC (American National Standards Institute/ Standards Planning \\nAnd Requirements Committee) architecture, after the committee that proposed it (Tsichritzis & Klug, 1978).External\\nView\\nConceptual Schema\\nInternal Schema\\nStored DatabaseExternal\\nView\\nInternal LevelConceptual/InternalMappingConceptual LevelExternal/Conceptual\\nMappingExternal LevelEnd Users\\n.  .  .Figure 2.2 \\nThe three-schema architecture.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 67}, page_content='2.2 Three-Schema Architecture and Data Independence  37\\n 2. The conceptual level  has a conceptual schema , which describes the structure \\nof the whole database for a community of users. The conceptual schema hides the details of physical storage structures and concentrates on describing enti-ties, data types, relationships, user operations, and constraints. Usually, a rep-resentational data model is used to describe the conceptual schema when a database system is implemented. This implementation conceptual schema  is \\noften based on a conceptual schema design  in a high-level data model.\\n \\n3. The external  or view level  includes a number of external schemas  or user \\nviews . Each external schema describes the part of the database that a partic-\\nular user group is interested in and hides the rest of the database from that user group. As in the previous level, each external schema is typically imple-mented using a representational data model, possibly based on an external schema design in a high-level conceptual data model.\\nThe three-schema architecture is a convenient tool with which the user can visual-\\nize the schema levels in a database system. Most DBMSs do not separate the three levels completely and explicitly, but they support the three-schema architecture to some extent. Some older DBMSs may include physical-level details in the concep-tual schema. The three-level ANSI architecture has an important place in database technology development because it clearly separates the users’ external level, the database’s conceptual level, and the internal storage level for designing a database. It is very much applicable in the design of DBMSs, even today. In most DBMSs that support user views, external schemas are specified in the same data model that describes the conceptual-level information (for example, a relational DBMS like Oracle or SQLServer uses SQL for this).\\nNotice that the three schemas are only descriptions  of data; the actual data is stored \\nat the physical level only. In the three-schema architecture, each user group refers to its own external schema. Hence, the DBMS must transform a request specified on an external schema into a request against the conceptual schema, and then into a request on the internal schema for processing over the stored database. If the request is a database retrieval, the data extracted from the stored database must be reformatted to match the user’s external view. The processes of transforming requests and results between levels are called mappings . These mappings may be \\ntime-consuming, so some DBMSs—especially those that are meant to support small databases—do not support external views. Even in such systems, however, it is nec-essary to transform requests between the conceptual and internal levels.\\n2.2.2 Data Independence\\nThe three-schema architecture can be used to further explain the concept of data \\nindependence , which can be defined as the capacity to change the schema at one \\nlevel of a database system without having to change the schema at the next higher \\nlevel. We can define two types of data independence:\\n 1. Logical data independence  is the capacity to change the conceptual schema \\nwithout having to change external schemas or application programs. We'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 68}, page_content='38 Chapter 2 Database System Concepts and Architecture\\nmay change the conceptual schema to expand the database (by adding a \\nrecord type or data item), to change constraints, or to reduce the database (by removing a record type or data item). In the last case, external schemas that refer only to the remaining data should not be affected. For example, the external schema of Figure 1.5(a) should not be affected by changing the \\nGRADE_REPORT  file (or record type) shown in Figure 1.2 into the one \\nshown in Figure 1.6(a). Only the view definition and the mappings need to be changed in a DBMS that supports logical data independence. After the conceptual schema undergoes a logical reorganization, application pro-grams that reference the external schema constructs must work as before. Changes to constraints can be applied to the conceptual schema without affecting the external schemas or application programs.\\n \\n2. Physical data independence  is the capacity to change the internal schema \\nwithout having to change the conceptual schema. Hence, the external sche-mas need not be changed as well. Changes to the internal schema may be needed because some physical files were reorganized—for example, by cre-ating additional access structures—to improve the performance of retrieval or update. If the same data as before remains in the database, we should not have to change the conceptual schema. For example, providing an access path to improve retrieval speed of SECTION records (Figure 1.2) by semes-ter and year should not require a query such as list all sections offered in fall \\n2008  to be changed, although the query would be executed more efficiently \\nby the DBMS by utilizing the new access path.\\nGenerally, physical data independence exists in most databases and file environ-\\nments where physical details, such as the exact location of data on disk, and hard-ware details of storage encoding, placement, compression, splitting, merging of records, and so on are hidden from the user. Applications remain unaware of these details. On the other hand, logical data independence is harder to achieve because it allows structural and constraint changes without affecting application programs—a much stricter requirement.\\nWhenever we have a multiple-level DBMS, its catalog must be expanded to include \\ninformation on how to map requests and data among the various levels. The DBMS uses additional software to accomplish these mappings by referring to the mapping information in the catalog. Data independence occurs because when the schema is changed at some level, the schema at the next higher level remains unchanged; only the mapping  between the two levels is changed. Hence, application programs refer-\\nring to the higher-level schema need not be changed.\\n2.3 Database Languages and Interfaces\\nIn Section 1.4 we discussed the variety of users supported by a DBMS. The DBMS \\nmust provide appropriate languages and interfaces for each category of users. In \\nthis section we discuss the types of languages and interfaces provided by a DBMS \\nand the user categories targeted by each interface.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 69}, page_content='2.3 Database Languages and Interfaces  39\\n2.3.1 DBMS Languages\\nOnce the design of a database is completed and a DBMS is chosen to implement the \\ndatabase, the first step is to specify conceptual and internal schemas for the data-base and any mappings between the two. In many DBMSs where no strict separa-tion of levels is maintained, one language, called the data definition language  \\n(DDL ), is used by the DBA and by database designers to define both schemas. The \\nDBMS will have a DDL compiler whose function is to process DDL statements in order to identify descriptions of the schema constructs and to store the schema description in the DBMS catalog.\\nIn DBMSs where a clear separation is maintained between the conceptual and \\ninternal levels, the DDL is used to specify the conceptual schema only. Another \\nlanguage, the storage definition language  (SDL ), is used to specify the internal \\nschema. The mappings between the two schemas may be specified in either one of these languages. In most relational DBMSs today, there is no specific language  that \\nperforms the role of SDL. Instead, the internal schema is specified by a combination of functions, parameters, and specifications related to storage of files. These permit the DBA staff to control indexing choices and mapping of data to storage. For a true three-schema architecture, we would need a third language, the view definition \\nlanguage  (VDL ), to specify user views and their mappings to the conceptual \\nschema, but in most DBMSs the DDL is used to define both conceptual and external \\nschemas . In relational DBMSs, SQL is used in the role of VDL to define user or \\napplication views  as results of predefined queries (see Chapters 6 and 7).\\nOnce the database schemas are compiled and the database is populated with data, \\nusers must have some means to manipulate the database. Typical manipulations include retrieval, insertion, deletion, and modification of the data. The DBMS pro-vides a set of operations or a language called the data manipulation language  \\n(DML ) for these purposes.\\nIn current DBMSs, the preceding types of languages are usually not considered dis-\\ntinct languages ; rather, a comprehensive integrated language is used that includes \\nconstructs for conceptual schema definition, view definition, and data manipula-tion. Storage definition is typically kept separate, since it is used for defining physi-cal storage structures to fine-tune the performance of the database system, which is usually done by the DBA staff. A typical example of a comprehensive database lan-guage is the SQL relational database language (see Chapters 6 and 7), which repre-sents a combination of DDL, VDL, and DML, as well as statements for constraint specification, schema evolution, and many other features. The SDL was a compo-nent in early versions of SQL but has been removed from the language to keep it at the conceptual and external levels only.\\nThere are two main types of DMLs. A high-level  or nonprocedural  DML can be \\nused on its own to specify complex database operations concisely. Many DBMSs \\nallow high-level DML statements either to be entered interactively from a display \\nmonitor or terminal or to be embedded in a general-purpose programming lan-\\nguage. In the latter case, DML statements must be identified within the program so'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 70}, page_content='40 Chapter 2 Database System Concepts and Architecture\\nthat they can be extracted by a precompiler and processed by the DBMS. A low-\\nlevel  or procedural  DML must  be embedded in a general-purpose programming \\nlanguage. This type of DML typically retrieves individual records or objects from the database and processes each separately. Therefore, it needs to use programming language constructs, such as looping, to retrieve and process each record from a set of records. Low-level DMLs are also called record-at-a-time  DMLs because of this \\nproperty. High-level DMLs, such as SQL, can specify and retrieve many records in a single DML statement; therefore, they are called set-at-a-time  or set-oriented  \\nDMLs. A query in a high-level DML often specifies which  data to retrieve rather \\nthan how to retrieve it; therefore, such languages are also called declarative .\\nWhenever DML commands, whether high level or low level, are embedded in a \\ngeneral-purpose programming language, that language is called the host language  \\nand the DML is called the data sublanguage .\\n10 On the other hand, a high-level \\nDML used in a standalone interactive manner is called a query language . In gen-\\neral, both retrieval and update commands of a high-level DML may be used inter-actively and are hence considered part of the query language.\\n11\\nCasual end users typically use a high-level query language to specify their requests, whereas programmers use the DML in its embedded form. For naive and paramet-ric users, there usually are user-friendly interfaces  for interacting with the data-\\nbase; these can also be used by casual users or others who do not want to learn the details of a high-level query language. We discuss these types of interfaces next.\\n2.3.2 DBMS Interfaces\\nUser-friendly interfaces provided by a DBMS may include the following:\\nMenu-based Interfaces for Web Clients or Browsing.  These interfaces pres-\\nent the user with lists of options (called menus)  that lead the user through the for-\\nmulation of a request. Menus do away with the need to memorize the specific commands and syntax of a query language; rather, the query is composed step-by-step by picking options from a menu that is displayed by the system. Pull-down menus are a very popular technique in Web-based user interfaces . They are also \\noften used in browsing interfaces , which allow a user to look through the contents \\nof a database in an exploratory and unstructured manner.\\nApps for Mobile Devices.  These interfaces present mobile users with access to \\ntheir data. For example, banking, reservations, and insurance companies, among many others, provide apps that allow users to access their data through a mobile phone or mobile device. The apps have built-in programmed interfaces that typically \\n10In object databases, the host and data sublanguages typically form one integrated language—for \\nexample, C++ with some extensions to support database functionality. Some relational systems also provide integrated languages—for example, Oracle’s PL/SQL.\\n11According to the English meaning of the word query , it should really be used to describe retrievals \\nonly, not updates.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 71}, page_content='2.3 Database Languages and Interfaces  41\\nallow users to login using their account name and password; the apps then provide \\na limited menu of options for mobile access to the user data, as well as options such as paying bills (for banks) or making reservations (for reservation Web sites).\\nForms-based Interfaces.  A forms-based interface displays a form to each user. \\nUsers can fill out all of the form  entries to insert new data, or they can fill out only \\ncertain entries, in which case the DBMS will retrieve matching data for the remain-ing entries. Forms are usually designed and programmed for naive users as inter-faces to canned transactions. Many DBMSs have forms specification languages , \\nwhich are special languages that help programmers specify such forms. SQL*Forms is a form-based language that specifies queries using a form designed in conjunc-tion with the relational database schema. Oracle Forms is a component of the Ora-cle product suite that provides an extensive set of features to design and build applications using forms. Some systems have utilities that define a form by letting the end user interactively construct a sample form on the screen.\\nGraphical User Interfaces.  A GUI typically displays a schema to the user in dia-\\ngrammatic form. The user then can specify a query by manipulating the diagram. In many cases, GUIs utilize both menus and forms.\\nNatural Language Interfaces.  These interfaces accept requests written in Eng-\\nlish or some other language and attempt to understand  them. A natural language \\ninterface usually has its own schema , which is similar to the database conceptual \\nschema, as well as a dictionary of important words. The natural language interface refers to the words in its schema, as well as to the set of standard words in its dic-tionary, that are used to interpret the request. If the interpretation is successful, the interface generates a high-level query corresponding to the natural language request and submits it to the DBMS for processing; otherwise, a dialogue is started with the user to clarify the request.\\nKeyword-based Database Search.  These are somewhat similar to Web search \\nengines, which accept strings of natural language (like English or Spanish) words and match them with documents at specific sites (for local search engines) or Web pages on the Web at large (for engines like Google or Ask). They use predefined indexes on words and use ranking functions to retrieve and present resulting docu-ments in a decreasing degree of match. Such “free form” textual query interfaces are not yet common in structured relational databases, although a research area called keyword-based querying  has emerged recently for relational databases.\\nSpeech Input and Output.  Limited use of speech as an input query and speech \\nas an answer to a question or result of a request is becoming commonplace. Appli-cations with limited vocabularies, such as inquiries for telephone directory, flight arrival/departure, and credit card account information, are allowing speech for input and output to enable customers to access this information. The speech input is detected using a library of predefined words and used to set up the parameters that are supplied to the queries. For output, a similar conversion from text or num-bers into speech takes place.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 72}, page_content='42 Chapter 2 Database System Concepts and Architecture\\nInterfaces for Parametric Users.  Parametric users, such as bank tellers, often \\nhave a small set of operations that they must perform repeatedly. For example, a teller is able to use single function keys to invoke routine and repetitive transactions such as account deposits or withdrawals, or balance inquiries. Systems analysts and programmers design and implement a special interface for each known class of naive users. Usually a small set of abbreviated commands is included, with the goal of minimizing the number of keystrokes required for each request.\\nInterfaces for the DBA.  Most database systems contain privileged commands \\nthat can be used only by the DBA staff. These include commands for creating accounts, setting system parameters, granting account authorization, changing a schema, and reorganizing the storage structures of a database.\\n2.4 The Database System Environment\\nA DBMS is a complex software system. In this section we discuss the types of soft-ware components that constitute a DBMS and the types of computer system soft-ware with which the DBMS interacts.\\n2.4.1 DBMS Component Modules\\nFigure 2.3 illustrates, in a simplified form, the typical DBMS components. The figure is divided into two parts. The top part of the figure refers to the various users of the database environment and their interfaces. The lower part shows the internal modules of the DBMS responsible for storage of data and processing of transactions.\\nThe database and the DBMS catalog are usually stored on disk. Access to the \\ndisk is controlled primarily by the operating system  (OS), which schedules disk \\nread/write. Many DBMSs have their own buffer management  module to sched-\\nule disk read/write, because management of buffer storage has a considerable effect on performance. Reducing disk read/write improves performance consid-erably. A higher-level stored data manager  module of the DBMS controls access \\nto DBMS information that is stored on disk, whether it is part of the database or the catalog.\\nLet us consider the top part of Figure 2.3 first. It shows interfaces for the DBA staff, \\ncasual users who work with interactive interfaces to formulate queries, application programmers who create programs using some host programming languages, and parametric users who do data entry work by supplying parameters to predefined \\ntransactions. The DBA staff works on defining the database and tuning it by mak-\\ning changes to its definition using the DDL and other privileged commands.\\nThe DDL compiler processes schema definitions, specified in the DDL, and stores \\ndescriptions of the schemas (meta-data) in the DBMS catalog. The catalog includes \\ninformation such as the names and sizes of files, names and data types of data items, \\nstorage details of each file, mapping information among schemas, and constraints.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 73}, page_content='2.4 The Database System Environment  43\\nIn addition, the catalog stores many other types of information that are needed by \\nthe DBMS modules, which can then look up the catalog information as needed.\\nCasual users and persons with occasional need for information from the database \\ninteract using the interactive query  interface in Figure 2.3. We have not explicitly \\nshown  any menu-based or form-based or mobile interactions that are typically used \\nto generate the interactive query automatically or to access canned transactions.

This internal query is subjected to query optimization \\n(discussed in Chapters 18 and 19). Among other things, the query optimizer  is \\nconcerned with the rearrangement and possible reordering of operations, elimina-tion of redundancies, and use of efficient search algorithms during execution. It consults the system catalog for statistical and other physical information about the stored data and generates executable code that performs the necessary operations for the query and makes calls on the runtime processor.\\nApplication programmers write programs in host languages such as Java, C, or C++ \\nthat are submitted to a precompiler. The precompiler  extracts DML commands \\nfrom an application program written in a host programming language. These com-mands are sent to the DML compiler for compilation into object code for database access. The rest of the program is sent to the host language compiler. The object codes for the DML commands and the rest of the program are linked, forming a canned transaction whose executable code includes calls to the runtime database processor. It is also becoming increasingly common to use scripting languages such as PHP and Python to write database programs. Canned transactions are executed repeatedly by parametric users via PCs or mobile apps; these users simply supply the parameters to the transactions. Each execution is considered to be a separate transaction. An example is a bank payment transaction where the account number, payee, and amount may be supplied as parameters.\\nIn the lower part of Figure 2.3, the runtime database processor  executes (1) the \\nprivileged commands, (2) the executable query plans, and (3) the canned transac-tions with runtime parameters. It works with the system catalog  and may update it \\nwith statistics. It also works with the stored data manager , which in turn uses basic \\noperating system services for carrying out low-level input/output (read/write) operations between the disk and main memory. The runtime database processor handles other aspects of data transfer, such as management of buffers in the main memory. Some DBMSs have their own buffer management module whereas others depend on the OS for buffer management. We have shown concurrency control  \\nand backup and recovery systems  separately as a module in this figure. They are \\nintegrated into the working of the runtime database processor for purposes of transaction management.\\nIt is common to have the client program  that accesses the DBMS running on a \\nseparate computer or device from the computer on which the database resides. The former is called the client computer  running DBMS client software and the latter is \\ncalled the database server . In many cases, the client accesses a middle computer, \\ncalled the application server , which in turn accesses the database server. We elabo-\\nrate on this topic in Section 2.5.\\nFigure 2.3 is not meant to describe a specific DBMS; rather, it illustrates typical \\nDBMS modules. The DBMS interacts with the operating system when disk accesses—to the database or to the catalog—are needed. If the computer system is shared by \\nmany users, the OS will schedule DBMS disk access requests and DBMS processing \\nalong with other processes. On the other hand, if the computer system is mainly \\ndedicated to running the database server, the DBMS will control main memory'),\n",

The DBMS also interfaces with compilers for general- \\npurpose host programming languages, and with application servers and client pro-grams running on separate machines through the system network interface.\\n2.4.2 Database System Utilities\\nIn addition to possessing the software modules just described, most DBMSs have database utilities  that help the DBA manage the database system. Common utili-\\nties have the following types of functions:\\n■ Loading. A loading utility is used to load existing data files—such as text \\nfiles or sequential files—into the database. Usually, the current (source) for-mat of the data file and the desired (target) database file structure are speci-fied to the utility, which then automatically reformats the data and stores it in the database. With the proliferation of DBMSs, transferring data from one DBMS to another is becoming common in many organizations. Some vendors offer conversion tools  that generate the appropriate loading pro-\\ngrams, given the existing source and target database storage descriptions (internal schemas).\\n■ Backup. A backup utility creates a backup copy of the database, usually by \\ndumping the entire database onto tape or other mass storage medium. The backup copy can be used to restore the database in case of catastrophic disk failure. Incremental backups are also often used, where only changes since the previous backup are recorded. Incremental backup is more complex, but saves storage space.\\n■ Database storage reorganization. This utility can be used to reorganize a \\nset of database files into different file organizations and create new access paths to improve performance.\\n■ Performance monitoring. Such a utility monitors database usage and pro-\\nvides statistics to the DBA. The DBA uses the statistics in making decisions such as whether or not to reorganize files or whether to add or drop indexes to improve performance.\\nOther utilities may be available for sorting files, handling data compression, \\nmonitoring access by users, interfacing with the network, and performing other functions.\\n2.4.3  Tools, Application Environments,  \\nand Communications Facilities\\nOther tools are often available to database designers, users, and the DBMS. CASE \\ntools12 are used in the design phase of database systems. Another tool that can be \\nquite useful in large organizations is an expanded data dictionary  (or data repository ) \\n12Although CASE stands for computer-aided software engineering, many CASE tools are used primarily \\nfor database design.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 76}, page_content='46 Chapter 2 Database System Concepts and Architecture\\nsystem . In addition to storing catalog information about schemas and  constraints, \\nthe data dictionary stores other information, such as design decisions, usage stan-dards, application program descriptions, and user information. Such a system is also called an information repository . This information can be accessed directly  by \\nusers or the DBA when needed. A data dictionary utility is similar to the DBMS catalog, but it includes a wider variety of information and is accessed mainly by users rather than by the DBMS software.\\nApplication development environments , such as PowerBuilder (Sybase)  \\nor JBuilder (Borland), have been quite popular. These systems provide an environ-ment for developing database applications and include facilities that help in many facets of database systems, including database design, GUI development, querying and updating, and application program development.\\nThe DBMS also needs to interface with communications software , whose function \\nis to allow users at locations remote from the database system site to access the database through computer terminals, workstations, or personal computers. These are connected to the database site through data communications hardware such as Internet routers, phone lines, long-haul networks, local networks, or satellite com-munication devices. Many commercial database systems have communication packages that work with the DBMS. The integrated DBMS and data communica-tions system is called a DB/DC  system. In addition, some distributed DBMSs are \\nphysically distributed over multiple machines. In this case, communications net-works are needed to connect the machines. These are often local area networks \\n(LANs) , but they can also be other types of networks.\\n2.5  Centralized and Client/Server  \\nArchitectures for DB MSs\\n2.5.1 Centralized DBMSs Architecture\\nArchitectures for DBMSs have followed trends similar to those for general com-\\nputer system architectures. Older architectures used mainframe computers to pro-\\nvide the main processing for all system functions, including user application \\nprograms and user interface programs, as well as all the DBMS functionality. The reason was that in older systems, most users accessed the DBMS via computer ter-minals that did not have processing power and only provided display capabilities. Therefore, all processing was performed remotely on the computer system housing the DBMS, and only display information and controls were sent from the computer to the display terminals, which were connected to the central computer via various types of communications networks.\\nAs prices of hardware declined, most users replaced their terminals with PCs and \\nworkstations, and more recently with mobile devices. At first, database systems used these computers similarly to how they had used display terminals, so that the DBMS itself was still a centralized  DBMS in which all the DBMS functionality,'),\n",

Figure 2.4 illustrates the physical components in a centralized archi-tecture. Gradually, DBMS systems started to exploit the available processing power at the user side, which led to client/server DBMS architectures.\\n2.5.2 Basic Client/Server Architectures\\nFirst, we discuss client/server architecture in general; then we discuss how it is applied to DBMSs. The client/server architecture  was developed to deal with com-\\nputing environments in which a large number of PCs, workstations, file servers, printers, database servers, Web servers, e-mail servers, and other software and equipment are connected via a network. The idea is to define specialized servers  \\nwith specific functionalities. For example, it is possible to connect a number of PCs or small workstations as clients to a file server  that maintains the files of the client \\nmachines. Another machine can be designated as a printer server  by being con-\\nnected to various printers; all print requests by the clients are forwarded to this \\nmachine. Web servers  or e-mail servers  also fall into the specialized server cate-\\ngory. The resources provided by specialized servers can be accessed by many client \\nmachines. The client machines  provide the user with the appropriate interfaces to \\nutilize these servers, as well as with local processing power to run local applications. \\nThis concept can be carried over to other software packages, with specialized pro-\\ngrams—such as a CAD (computer-aided design) package—being stored on specific server machines and being made accessible to multiple clients.

Some machines would be client sites only (for example, mobile devices or workstations/PCs that have only client software installed). Other machines would be dedicated servers, and others would have both client and server functionality.\\nThe concept of client/server architecture assumes an underlying framework that \\nconsists of many PCs/workstations and mobile devices as well as a smaller number \\nof server machines, connected via wireless networks or LANs and other types of computer networks. A client  in this framework is typically a user machine that pro-\\nvides user interface capabilities and local processing. When a client requires access \\nto additional functionality—such as database access—that does not exist at the cli-\\nent, it connects to a server that provides the needed functionality. A server  is a sys-\\ntem containing both hardware and software that can provide services to the client machines, such as file access, printing, archiving, or database access. In general, some machines install only client software, others only server software, and still others may include both client and server software, as illustrated in Figure 2.6. However, it is more common that client and server software usually run on separate Client Client Client\\nPrint\\nServerDBMS\\nServerFile\\nServer. . .\\n. . .Network\\nFigure 2.5 \\nLogical two-tier  client/server  \\narchitecture.\\nClient CLIENT\\nSite 2Client\\nwith Disk\\nClient\\nSite 1Diskless\\nClient\\nServer\\nSite 3Server\\nCommunication\\nNetworkSite nServer\\nand Client\\n. . .\\nClientServerFigure 2.6 \\nPhysical two-tier  client/server \\n architecture.'),\n",

Two main types of basic DBMS architectures were created on this under-\\nlying client/server framework: two-tier  and three-tier .13 We discuss them next.\\n2.5.3 Two-Tier Client/Server Architectures for DBMSs\\nIn relational database management systems (RDBMSs), many of which started \\nas centralized systems, the system components that were first moved to the  client side were the user interface and application programs. Because SQL (see Chapters 6 and 7) provided a standard language for RDBMSs, this created a logical dividing point between client and server. Hence, the query and transac-tion functionality related to SQL processing remained on the server side. In such an architecture, the server is often called a query server  or transaction \\nserver  because it provides these two functionalities. In an RDBMS, the server is \\nalso often called an SQL server .\\nThe user interface programs and application programs can run on the client side. \\nWhen DBMS access is required, the program establishes a connection to the DBMS (which is on the server side); once the connection is created, the client program can communicate with the DBMS. A standard called Open Database \\nConnectivity  (ODBC ) provides an application programming interface  (API ), \\nwhich allows client-side programs to call the DBMS, as long as both client and server machines have the necessary software installed. Most DBMS vendors pro-vide ODBC drivers for their systems. A client program can actually connect to \\nseveral RDBMSs and send query and transaction requests using the ODBC API, \\nwhich are then processed at the server sites. Any query results are sent back to the client program, which can process and display the results as needed. A related standard for the Java programming language, called JDBC , has also been defined. \\nThis allows Java client programs to access one or more DBMSs through a stan-dard interface.\\nThe architectures described here are called two-tier architectures  because the soft-\\nware components are distributed over two systems: client and server. The advan-tages of this architecture are its simplicity and seamless compatibility with existing systems. The emergence of the Web changed the roles of clients and servers, leading to the three-tier architecture.\\n2.5.4  Three-Tier and n-Tier Architectures  \\nfor Web Applications\\nMany Web applications use an architecture called the three-tier architecture , \\nwhich adds an intermediate layer between the client and the database server, as \\nillustrated in Figure 2.7(a).\\n13There are many other variations of client/server architectures. We discuss the two most basic ones \\nhere.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 80}, page_content='50 Chapter 2 Database System Concepts and Architecture\\nThis intermediate layer or middle tier  is called the application server  or the Web \\nserver , depending on the application. This server plays an intermediary role by \\nrunning application programs and storing business rules (procedures or con-straints) that are used to access data from the database server. It can also improve database security by checking a client’s credentials before forwarding a request to the database server. Clients contain user interfaces and Web browsers. The inter-mediate server accepts requests from the client, processes the request and sends database queries and commands to the database server, and then acts as a conduit for passing (partially) processed data from the database server to the clients, where it may be processed further and filtered to be presented to the users. Thus, the user \\ninterface, application rules,  and data access  act as the three tiers. Figure 2.7(b) shows \\nanother view of the three-tier architecture used by database and other application \\npackage vendors. The presentation layer displays information to the user and allows data entry. The business logic layer handles intermediate rules and constraints before data is passed up to the user or down to the DBMS. The bottom layer includes all data management services. The middle layer can also act as a Web server, which retrieves query results from the database server and formats them into dynamic \\nWeb pages that are viewed by the Web browser at the client side. The client machine \\nis typically a PC or mobile device connected to the Web.\\nOther architectures have also been proposed. It is possible to divide the layers \\nbetween the user and the stored data further into finer components, thereby giving rise to n-tier architectures, where n may be four or five tiers. Typically, the business \\nlogic layer is divided into multiple layers. Besides distributing programming and data throughout a network, n-tier applications afford the advantage that any one \\ntier can run on an appropriate processor or operating system platform and can be handled independently. Vendors of ERP (enterprise resource planning) and CRM (customer relationship management) packages often use a middleware layer,  which GUI,\\nWeb InterfaceClient\\nApplication Server\\nor\\nWeb Server\\nDatabase\\nServerApplication\\nPrograms,\\nWeb Pages\\nDatabase\\nManagement\\nSystemPresentation\\nLayer\\nBusiness\\nLogic Layer\\nDatabase\\nServices\\nLayer\\n(a) (b)Figure 2.7 \\nLogical three-tier  client/server \\n architecture, with a \\ncouple of commonly used nomenclatures.'),\n",

The latter can be done by the hardware or by advanced software. This technology gives higher levels of data security, but the network security issues remain a major con-cern. Various technologies for data compression also help to transfer large amounts of data from servers to clients over wired and wireless networks.\\n2.6  Classification of Database \\nManagement Systems\\nSeveral criteria can be used to classify DBMSs. The first is the data model  on  \\nwhich the DBMS is based. The main data model used in many current commercial DBMSs is the relational data model , and the systems based on this model are \\nknown as SQL systems.  The object data model  has been implemented in some \\ncommercial systems but has not had widespread use. Recently, so-called big data \\nsystems,  also known as key-value storage systems  and NOSQL systems,  use vari-\\nous data models: document-based,  graph-based,  column-based,  and key-value \\ndata models.  Many legacy applications still run on database systems based on the \\nhierarchical  and network data models .\\nThe relational DBMSs are evolving continuously, and, in particular, have been \\nincorporating many of the concepts that were developed in object databases. This \\nhas led to a new class of DBMSs called object-relational DBMS s. We can catego-\\nrize DBMSs based on the data model: relational, object, object-relational, NOSQL, key-value, hierarchical, network, and other.\\nSome experimental DBMSs are based on the XML (eXtended Markup Language) \\nmodel, which is a tree-structured data model.  These have been called native XML \\nDBMSs.  Several commercial relational DBMSs have added XML interfaces and \\nstorage to their products.\\nThe second criterion used to classify DBMSs is the number of users  supported by \\nthe system. Single-user systems  support only one user at a time and are mostly \\nused with PCs. Multiuser systems , which include the majority of DBMSs, support \\nconcurrent multiple users.\\nThe third criterion is the number of sites  over which the database is distributed. A \\nDBMS is centralized  if the data is stored at a single computer site. A centralized \\nDBMS can support multiple users, but the DBMS and the database reside totally at a single computer site. A distributed  DBMS (DDBMS) can have the actual database \\nand DBMS software distributed over many sites connected by a computer network. Big data systems are often massively distributed, with hundreds of sites. The data is often replicated on multiple sites so that failure of a site will not make some data unavailable.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 82}, page_content='52 Chapter 2 Database System Concepts and Architecture\\nHomogeneous  DDBMSs use the same DBMS software at all the sites, whereas \\nheterogeneous  DDBMSs can use different DBMS software at each site. It is also \\npossible to develop middleware software  to access several autonomous preexisting \\ndatabases stored under heterogeneous DBMSs. This leads to a federated  DBMS (or \\nmultidatabase system ), in which the participating DBMSs are loosely coupled and \\nhave a degree of local autonomy. Many DDBMSs use client-server architecture, as we described in Section 2.5.\\nThe fourth criterion is cost. It is difficult to propose a classification of DBMSs \\nbased on cost. Today we have open source (free) DBMS products like MySQL and PostgreSQL that are supported by third-party vendors with additional services. The main RDBMS products are available as free examination 30-day copy versions as well as personal versions, which may cost under $100 and allow a fair amount of functionality. The giant systems are being sold in modular form with components to handle distribution, replication, parallel processing, mobile capability, and so on, and with a large number of parameters that must be defined for the configura-tion. Furthermore, they are sold in the form of licenses—site licenses allow unlim-ited use of the database system with any number of copies running at the customer site. Another type of license limits the number of concurrent users or the number of user seats at a location. Standalone single-user versions of some systems like Microsoft Access are sold per copy or included in the overall configuration of a desktop or laptop. In addition, data warehousing and mining features, as well as support for additional data types, are made available at extra cost. It is possible to pay millions of dollars for the installation and maintenance of large database sys-tems annually.\\nWe can also classify a DBMS on the basis of the types of access path  options for \\nstoring files. One well-known family of DBMSs is based on inverted file structures. Finally, a DBMS can be general purpose  or special purpose . When performance is \\na primary consideration, a special-purpose DBMS can be designed and built for a specific application; such a system cannot be used for other applications without major changes. Many airline reservations and telephone directory systems devel-oped in the past are special-purpose DBMSs. These fall into the category of online \\ntransaction processing  (OLTP ) systems, which must support a large number of \\nconcurrent transactions without imposing excessive delays.\\nLet us briefly elaborate on the main criterion for classifying DBMSs: the data \\nmodel. The relational data model  represents a database as a collection of tables, \\nwhere each table can be stored as a separate file. The database in Figure 1.2 resem-bles a basic relational representation. Most relational databases use the high-level query language called SQL and support a limited form of user views. We discuss the relational model and its languages and operations in Chapters 5 through 8, and techniques for programming relational applications in Chapters 10 and 11.\\nThe object data model  defines a database in terms of objects, their properties, and \\ntheir operations. Objects with the same structure and behavior belong to a class , \\nand classes are organized into hierarchies  (or acyclic graphs ). The operations of'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 83}, page_content='2.6 Classification of Database Management Systems  53\\neach class are specified in terms of predefined procedures called methods . Rela-\\ntional DBMSs have been extending their models to incorporate object database concepts and other capabilities; these systems are referred to as object-relational  or \\nextended relational systems . We discuss object databases and object-relational \\nsystems in Chapter 12.\\nBig data systems are based on various data models, with the following four data \\nmodels most common. The key-value data model  associates a unique key with \\neach value (which can be a record or object) and provides very fast access to a value given its key. The document data model  is based on JSON (Java Script \\nObject Notation) and stores the data as documents, which somewhat resemble complex objects. The graph data model  stores objects as graph nodes and rela-\\ntionships among objects as directed graph edges. Finally, the column-based data \\nmodels  store the columns of rows clustered on disk pages for fast access and \\nallow multiple versions of the data. We will discuss some of these in more detail in Chapter 24.\\nThe XML model  has emerged as a standard for exchanging data over the Web and \\nhas been used as a basis for implementing several prototype native XML systems. XML uses hierarchical tree structures. It combines database concepts with concepts from document representation models. Data is represented as elements; with the use of tags, data can be nested to create complex tree structures. This model con-ceptually resembles the object model but uses different terminology. XML capabili-ties have been added to many commercial DBMS products. We present an overview of XML in Chapter 13.\\nTwo older, historically important data models, now known as legacy data models , \\nare the network and hierarchical models. The network model  represents data as \\nrecord types and also represents a limited type of 1:N relationship, called a set type . \\nA 1:N, or one-to-many, relationship relates one instance of a record to many record instances using some pointer linking mechanism in these models. The network model, also known as the CODASYL DBTG model,\\n14 has an associated record-at-\\na-time language that must be embedded in a host programming language. The net-\\nwork DML was proposed in the 1971 Database Task Group (DBTG) Report as an \\nextension of the COBOL language.\\nThe hierarchical model  represents data as hierarchical tree structures. Each hierar-\\nchy represents a number of related records. There is no standard language for the \\nhierarchical model. A popular hierarchical DML is DL/1 of the IMS system. It dom-inated the DBMS market for over 20 years between 1965 and 1985. Its DML, called DL/1, was a de facto industry standard for a long time.\\n15\\n14CODASYL DBTG stands for Conference on Data Systems Languages Database Task Group, which is \\nthe committee that specified the network model and its language.\\n15The full chapters on the network and hierarchical models from the second edition of this book are \\navailable from this book’s Companion Web site at http://www.aw.com/elmasri.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 84}, page_content='54 Chapter 2 Database System Concepts and Architecture\\n2.7 Summary\\nIn this chapter we introduced the main concepts used in database systems. We \\ndefined a data model and we distinguished three main categories:\\n■ High-level or conceptual data models (based on entities and relationships)\\n■ Low-level or physical data models\\n■ Representational or implementation data models (record-based, object-\\noriented)\\nWe distinguished the schema, or description of a database, from the database itself. \\nThe schema does not change very often, whereas the database state changes every time data is inserted, deleted, or modified. Then we described the three-schema DBMS architecture, which allows three schema levels:\\n■ An internal schema describes the physical storage structure of the database.\\n■ A conceptual schema is a high-level description of the whole database.\\n■ External schemas describe the views of different user groups.\\nA DBMS that cleanly separates the three levels must have mappings among \\nthe\\xa0schemas to transform requests and query results from one level to the next.\\xa0Most DBMSs do not separate the three levels completely. We used the three-schema architecture to define the concepts of logical and physical data independence.\\nThen we discussed the main types of languages and interfaces that DBMSs support. \\nA data definition language (DDL) is used to define the database conceptual schema. In most DBMSs, the DDL also defines user views and, sometimes, storage struc-tures; in other DBMSs, separate languages or functions exist for specifying storage structures. This distinction is fading away in today’s relational implementations, with SQL serving as a catchall language to perform multiple roles, including view definition. The storage definition part (SDL) was included in SQL’s early versions, but is now typically implemented as special commands for the DBA in relational DBMSs. The DBMS compiles all schema definitions and stores their descriptions in the DBMS catalog.\\nA data manipulation language (DML) is used for specifying database retrievals and \\nupdates. DMLs can be high level (set-oriented, nonprocedural) or low level (record-oriented, procedural). A high-level DML can be embedded in a host programming language, or it can be used as a standalone language; in the latter case it is often called a query language.\\nWe discussed different types of interfaces provided by DBMSs and the types of \\nDBMS users with which each interface is associated. Then we discussed the database system environment, typical DBMS software modules, and DBMS utilities for helping users and the DBA staff perform their tasks. We continued with an overview of the two-tier and three-tier architectures for database  applications.'),\n",

We discussed the availabil-ity of DBMSs and additional modules—from no cost in the form of open source software to configurations that annually cost millions to maintain. We also pointed out the variety of licensing arrangements for DBMS and related prod-ucts. The main classification of DBMSs is based on the data model.

In addition to constraints relating the values of col-umns in one table to columns in another table, there are also constraints that impose restrictions on values in a column or a combination of columns within a table. One such constraint dictates that a column or a group of col-umns must be unique across all rows in the table. For example, in the  \\nSTUDENT  table, the Student_number  column must be unique (to prevent two \\ndifferent students from having the same Student_number ). Identify the col-\\numn or the group of columns in the other tables that must be unique across \\nall rows in the table.\\nSelected Bibliography\\nMany database textbooks, including Date (2004), Silberschatz et al. (2011), Ramak-rishnan and Gehrke (2003), Garcia-Molina et al. (2002, 2009), and Abiteboul et al. (1995), provide a discussion of the various database concepts presented here.  Tsichritzis and Lochovsky (1982) is an early textbook on data models. Tsichritzis and Klug (1978) and Jardine (1977) present the three-schema architecture, which \\nwas first suggested in the DBTG CODASYL report (1971) and later in an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) report (1975). An in-depth analysis of the rela-tional data model and some of its possible extensions is given in Codd (1990). The proposed standard for object-oriented databases is described in Cattell et al.

Gener-\\nally, the term database application  refers to a particular database and the associ-\\nated programs that implement the database queries and updates. For example, a BANK database application that keeps track of customer accounts would include programs that implement database updates corresponding to customer deposits and withdrawals. These programs would provide user-friendly graphical user inter-faces (GUIs) utilizing forms and menus for the end users of the application—the bank customers or bank tellers in this example. In addition, it is now common to provide interfaces to these programs to \\nBANK  customers via mobile devices using \\nmobile apps . Hence, a major part of the database application will require the \\ndesign, implementation, and testing of these application programs. Traditionally, the design and testing of application programs  has been considered to be part of \\nsoftware engineering  rather than database design . In many software design tools, the \\ndatabase design methodologies and software engineering methodologies are inter-twined since these activities are strongly related.\\nIn this chapter, we follow the traditional approach of concentrating on the database \\nstructures and constraints during conceptual database design. The design of appli-cation programs is typically covered in software engineering courses. We present the modeling concepts of the entity–relationship  (ER) model , which is a popular \\nhigh-level conceptual data model. This model and its variations are frequently used for the conceptual design of database applications, and many database design tools employ its concepts. We describe the basic data-structuring concepts and con-straints of the ER model and discuss their use in the design of conceptual schemas for database applications. We also present the diagrammatic notation associated with the ER model, known as ER diagrams .3 chapter  3'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 90}, page_content='60 Chapter 3 Data Modeling Using the Entity–Relationship (ER) Model\\nObject modeling methodologies such as the Unified Modeling Language  (UML ) \\nare becoming increasingly popular in both database and software design. These methodologies go beyond database design to specify detailed design of software modules and their interactions using various types of diagrams. An important part of these methodologies—namely, class diagrams\\n1—is similar in many ways to the \\nER diagrams. In class diagrams, operations  on objects are specified, in addition to \\nspecifying the database schema structure. Operations can be used to specify the functional requirements  during database design, as we will discuss in Section 3.1. \\nWe present some of the UML notation and concepts for class diagrams that are particularly relevant to database design in Section 3.8, and we briefly compare these to ER notation and concepts. Additional UML notation and concepts are presented in Section 4.6.\\nThis chapter is organized as follows: Section 3.1 discusses the role of high-level con-\\nceptual data models in database design. We introduce the requirements for a sam-\\nple database application in Section 3.2 to illustrate the use of concepts from the ER \\nmodel. This sample database is used throughout the text. In Section 3.3 we present \\nthe concepts of entities and attributes, and we gradually introduce the diagram-\\nmatic technique for displaying an ER schema. In Section 3.4 we introduce the con-\\ncepts of binary relationships and their roles and structural constraints. Section 3.5 \\nintroduces weak entity types. Section 3.6 shows how a schema design is refined to \\ninclude relationships. Section 3.7 reviews the notation for ER diagrams, summa-rizes the issues and common pitfalls that occur in schema design, and discusses how to choose the names for database schema constructs such as entity types and relationship types. Section 3.8 introduces some UML class diagram concepts, com-pares them to ER model concepts, and applies them to the same COMPANY data-base example. Section 3.9 discusses more complex types of relationships. Sec - tion  3.10 summarizes the chapter.\\nThe material in Sections 3.8 and 3.9 may be excluded from an introductory course. If \\na more thorough coverage of data modeling concepts and conceptual database design is desired, the reader should continue to Chapter 4, where we describe extensions to the ER model that lead to the enhanced–ER (EER) model, which includes concepts such as specialization, generalization, inheritance, and union types (categories).\\n3.1  Using High-Level Conceptual Data Models \\nfor Database Design\\nFigure 3.1 shows a simplified overview of the database design process. The first step \\nshown is requirements collection and analysis . During this step, the database \\ndesigners interview prospective database users to understand and document their \\ndata requirements . The result of this step is a concisely written set of users’ require-\\nments. These requirements should be specified in as detailed and complete a form \\nas possible. In parallel with specifying the data requirements, it is useful to specify \\n1A class  is similar to an entity type  in many ways.'),\n",

These consist of the user-\\ndefined operations  (or transactions ) that will be applied to the database, including \\nboth retrievals and updates. In software design, it is common to use data flow dia-\\ngrams , sequence diagrams , scenarios , and other techniques to specify functional \\nrequirements. We will not discuss any of these techniques here; they are usually described in detail in software engineering texts.\\nOnce the requirements have been collected and analyzed, the next step is to create a \\nconceptual schema  for the database, using a high-level conceptual data model.

The conceptual schema is a concise description of \\nthe data requirements of the users and includes detailed descriptions of the entity types, relationships, and constraints; these are expressed using the concepts pro-vided by the high-level data model. Because these concepts do not include imple-mentation details, they are usually easier to understand and can be used to communicate with nontechnical users. The high-level conceptual schema can also be used as a reference to ensure that all users’ data requirements are met and that the requirements do not conflict. This approach enables database designers to con-centrate on specifying the properties of the data, without being concerned with storage and implementation details, which makes it is easier to create a good con-ceptual database design.\\nDuring or after the conceptual schema design, the basic data model operations can \\nbe used to specify the high-level user queries and operations identified during functional analysis. This also serves to confirm that the conceptual schema meets all the identified functional requirements. Modifications to the conceptual schema can be introduced if some functional requirements cannot be specified using the initial schema.\\nThe next step in database design is the actual implementation of the database, using \\na commercial DBMS. Most current commercial DBMSs use an implementation data model—such as the relational (SQL) model—so the conceptual schema is transformed from the high-level data model into the implementation data model. This step is called logical design  or data model mapping ; its result is a database \\nschema in the implementation data model of the DBMS. Data model mapping is often automated or semiautomated within the database design tools.\\nThe last step is the physical design  phase, during which the internal storage struc-\\ntures, file organizations, indexes, access paths, and physical design parameters for the database files are specified. In parallel with these activities, application pro-grams are designed and implemented as database transactions corresponding to the high-level transaction specifications.\\nWe present only the basic ER model concepts for conceptual schema design in this \\nchapter. Additional modeling concepts are discussed in Chapter 4, when we intro-duce the EER model.\\n3.2 A Sample Database Application\\nIn this section we describe a sample database application, called COMPANY , which \\nserves to illustrate the basic ER model concepts and their use in schema design. We list the data requirements for the database here, and then create its conceptual schema step-by-step as we introduce the modeling concepts of the ER model. The \\nCOMPANY  database keeps track of a company’s employees, departments, and  \\nprojects. Suppose that after the requirements collection and analysis phase, the database designers provide the following description of the miniworld —the part of \\nthe company that will be represented in the database.'),\n",

The basic concept that the ER model represents is \\nan entity , which is a thing  or object  in the real world with an independent existence. \\nAn entity may be an object with a physical existence (for example, a particular per-son, car, house, or employee) or it may be an object with a conceptual existence (for instance, a company, a job, or a university course). Each entity has attributes —the \\nparticular properties that describe it. For example, an \\nEMPLOYEE  entity may be \\ndescribed by the employee’s name, age, address, salary, and job. A particular entity \\n2The Social Security number, or SSN, is a unique nine-digit identifier assigned to each individual in the \\nUnited States to keep track of his or her employment, benefits, and taxes.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 95}, page_content='3.3 Entity Types, Entity Sets, Attributes, and Keys  65\\nSeveral types of attributes occur in the ER model: simple  versus composite , single-\\nvalued  versus multivalued , and stored  versus derived . First we define these attribute \\ntypes and illustrate their use via examples. Then we discuss the concept of a NULL  \\nvalue  for an attribute.\\nComposite versus Simple (Atomic) Attributes. Composite attributes  can be \\ndivided into smaller subparts, which represent more basic attributes with indepen-dent meanings. For example, the \\nAddress  attribute of the EMPLOYEE  entity shown \\nin Figure 3.3 can be subdivided into Street_address , City, State , and Zip,3 with the \\nvalues ‘2311 Kirby’, ‘Houston’, ‘Texas’, and ‘77001’. Attributes that are not divisible are called simple  or atomic attributes . Composite attributes can form a hierarchy; \\nfor example, \\nStreet_address  can be further subdivided into three simple component \\nattributes: Number , Street , and Apartment_number , as shown in Figure 3.4. The value \\nof a composite attribute is the concatenation of the values of its component simple attributes.\\nComposite attributes are useful to model situations in which a user sometimes \\nrefers to the composite attribute as a unit but at other times refers specifically to its Name = John SmithName = Sunco Oil\\nHeadquarters = Houston\\nPresident = John SmithAddress = 2311 Kirby\\nHouston, Texas 77001\\nAge = 55e1 c1\\nHome_phone = 713-749-2630Figure 3.3\\nTwo entities, EMPLOYEE e\\n1, and \\nCOMPANY c1, and \\ntheir attributes.\\n3Zip Code is the name used in the United States for a five-digit postal code, such as 76019, which can \\nbe extended to nine digits, such as 76019-0015.

If the composite attribute is referenced only as a whole, there is no \\nneed to subdivide it into component attributes. For example, if there is no need to refer to the individual components of an address (Zip Code, street, and so on), then the whole address can be designated as a simple attribute.\\nSingle-Valued versus Multivalued Attributes. Most attributes have a single \\nvalue for a particular entity; such attributes are called single-valued . For example,  \\nAge is a single-valued attribute of a person. In some cases an attribute can have a  \\nset of values for the same entity—for instance, a Colors  attribute for a car, or a  \\nCollege_degrees  attribute for a person. Cars with one color have a single value, \\nwhereas two-tone cars have two color values. Similarly, one person may not have any college degrees, another person may have one, and a third person may have two or more degrees; therefore, different people can have different numbers  of values  for the \\nCollege_degrees  attribute. Such attributes are called multivalued . A multivalued  \\nattribute may have lower and upper bounds to constrain the number of values  allowed \\nfor each individual entity. For example, the Colors  attribute of a car may be restricted to \\nhave between one and two values, if we assume that a car can have two colors at most.\\nStored versus Derived Attributes. In some cases, two (or more) attribute val-\\nues are related—for example, the Age and Birth_date  attributes of a person. For a \\nparticular person entity, the value of Age can be determined from the current \\n(today’s) date and the value of that person’s Birth_date . The Age attribute is hence \\ncalled a derived attribute  and is said to be derivable from  the Birth_date  attribute, \\nwhich is called a stored attribute . Some attribute values can be derived from related \\nentities ; for example, an attribute Number_of_employees  of a DEPARTMENT  entity  \\ncan be derived by counting the number of employees related to (working for) that \\ndepartment.\\nNULL Values. In some cases, a particular entity may not have an applicable value \\nfor an attribute. For example, the Apartment_number  attribute of an address applies \\nonly to addresses that are in apartment buildings and not to other types of resi-dences, such as single-family homes. Similarly, a \\nCollege_degrees  attribute applies \\nonly to people with college degrees. For such situations, a special value called NULL   \\nis created. An address of a single-family home would have NULL  for its  \\nApartment_number  attribute, and a person with no college degree would have  \\nNULL  for College_degrees . NULL  can also be used if we do not know the value of an \\nattribute for a particular entity—for example, if we do not know the home phone \\nnumber of ‘John Smith’ in Figure 3.3. The meaning of the former type of NULL  is  \\nnot applicable , whereas the meaning of the latter is unknown . The unknown  category \\nof NULL  can be further classified into two cases. The first case arises when it is known \\nthat the attribute value exists but is missing —for instance, if the Height  attribute of a \\nperson is listed as NULL . The second case arises when it is not known  whether the \\nattribute value exists—for example, if the Home_phone  attribute of a person is NULL .\\nComplex Attributes.

Such attributes are called complex attributes . For example, if a person \\ncan have more than one residence and each residence can have a single address and multiple phones, an attribute \\nAddress_phone  for a person can be specified as shown \\nin Figure 3.5.4 Both Phone  and Address  are themselves composite attributes.\\n3.3.2 Entity Types, Entity Sets, Keys, and Value Sets\\nEntity Types and Entity Sets. A database usually contains groups of entities that \\nare similar. For example, a company employing hundreds of employees may want to store similar information concerning each of the employees. These employee entities share the same attributes, but each entity has its own value (s) for each attribute. An \\nentity type  defines a collection  (or set) of entities that have the same attributes. Each \\nentity type in the database is described by its name and attributes. Figure 3.6 shows two entity types: \\nEMPLOYEE  and COMPANY , and a list of some of the attributes  \\nfor each. A few individual entities of each type are also illustrated, along with the values of their attributes. The collection of all entities of a particular entity type in the \\n4For those familiar with XML, we should note that complex attributes are similar to complex elements in \\nXML (see Chapter 13).{Address_phone( {Phone(Area_code,Phone_number)},Address(Street_address\\n(Number,Street,Apartment_number),City,State,Zip) )} Figure 3.5\\nA complex attribute: Address_phone.\\nEntity Type Name:\\nEntity Set:\\n(Extension)COMPANY\\nName, Headquarters, PresidentEMPLOYEE\\nName, Age, Salary \\n(John Smith, 55, 80k)\\n(Fred Brown, 40, 30K)\\n(Judy Clark, 25, 20K)e1 c1\\nc2e2\\ne3(Sunco Oil, Houston, John Smith)\\n(Fast Computer, Dallas, Bob King)Figure 3.6\\nTwo entity types, EMPLOYEE and COMPANY, and some member entities of each.'),\n",

For example, \\nEMPLOYEE  refers to both a type of entity  as  \\nwell as the current collection of all employee entities  in the database. It is now more \\ncommon to give separate names to the entity type and entity collection; for example in object and object-relational data models (see Chapter 12).\\nAn entity type is represented in ER diagrams\\n5 (see Figure 3.2) as a rectangular box \\nenclosing the entity type name. Attribute names are enclosed in ovals and are attached to their entity type by straight lines. Composite attributes are attached to their component attributes by straight lines. Multivalued attributes are displayed in double ovals. Figure 3.7(a) shows a \\nCAR  entity type in this notation.\\nAn entity type describes the schema  or intension  for a set of entities  that share the \\nsame structure. The collection of entities of a particular entity type is grouped into an entity set, which is also called the extension  of the entity type.\\nKey Attributes of an Entity Type. An important constraint on the entities of an \\nentity type is the key or uniqueness constraint  on attributes. An entity type usually \\nhas one or more attributes whose values are distinct for each individual entity in the \\nentity set. Such an attribute is called a key attribute , and its values can be used to \\nidentify each entity uniquely. For example, the Name attribute is a key of the  \\nCOMPANY  entity type in Figure 3.6 because no two companies are allowed to have \\nthe same name. For the PERSON  entity type, a typical key attribute is Ssn (Social Secu-\\nrity number). Sometimes several attributes together form a key, meaning that the \\ncombination  of the attribute values must be distinct for each entity. If a set of attri-\\nbutes possesses this property, the proper way to represent this in the ER model that \\nwe describe here is to define a composite attribute  and designate it as a key attribute \\nof the entity type. Notice that such a composite key must be minimal ; that is, all \\ncomponent attributes must be included in the composite attribute to have the \\nuniqueness property. Superfluous attributes must not be included in a key. In ER \\ndiagrammatic notation, each key attribute has its name underlined  inside the oval, \\nas illustrated in Figure 3.7(a).\\nSpecifying that an attribute is a key of an entity type means that the preceding \\nuniqueness property must hold for every entity set  of the entity type. Hence, it is a \\nconstraint that prohibits any two entities from having the same value for the key attribute at the same time. It is not the property of a particular entity set; rather, it is a constraint on any entity set  of the entity type at any point in time. This key con-\\nstraint (and other constraints we discuss later) is derived from the constraints of the miniworld that the database represents.\\nSome entity types have more than one  key attribute. For example, each of the  \\nVehicle_id  and Registration  attributes of the entity type CAR  (Figure 3.7) is a key in  \\n5We use a notation for ER diagrams that is close to the original proposed notation (Chen, 1976). Many \\nother notations are in use; we illustrate some of them later in this chapter when we present UML class diagrams, and some additional diagrammatic notations are given in Appendix A.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 99}, page_content='3.3 Entity Types, Entity Sets, Attributes, and Keys  69\\nits own right. The Registration  attribute is an example of a composite key formed \\nfrom two simple component attributes, State  and Number , neither of which is a key \\non its own. An entity type may also have no key , in which case it is called a weak \\nentity type  (see Section 3.5).\\nIn our diagrammatic notation, if two attributes are underlined separately, then each \\nis a key on its own . Unlike the relational model (see Section 5.2.2), there is no con-\\ncept of primary key in the ER model that we present here; the primary key will be chosen during mapping to a relational schema (see Chapter 9).\\nValue Sets (Domains) of Attributes. Each simple attribute of an entity type is \\nassociated with a value set  (or domain  of values), which specifies the set of values \\nthat may be assigned to that attribute for each individual entity. In Figure 3.6, if the \\nrange of ages allowed for employees is between 16 and 70, we can specify the value \\nset of the \\nAge attribute of EMPLOYEE  to be the set of integer numbers between 16 \\nand 70. Similarly, we can specify the value set for the Name  attribute to be the set of \\nstrings of alphabetic characters separated by blank characters, and so on. Value sets \\nare not typically displayed in basic ER diagrams and are similar to the basic data \\ntypes  available in most programming languages, such as integer, string, Boolean, \\nfloat, enumerated type, subrange, and so on. However, data types of attributes can Model\\nMakeVehicle_id\\nYear\\nColorRegistrationState(a)\\n(b)Number\\nCAR\\nCAR 1  \\n((ABC 123, TEXAS), TK629, Ford Mustang, convertible, 2004 {red, black})\\nCAR 2  \\n((ABC 123, NEW YORK), WP9872, Nissan Maxima, 4-door, 2005, {blue})\\nCAR 3  \\n((VSY 720, TEXAS), TD729, Chrysler LeBaron, 4-door, 2002, {white, blue})\\n CAR\\nRegistration (Number, State), Vehicle_id, Make, Model, Year, {Color} \\nFigure 3.7\\nThe CAR entity type with two key attributes, Registration and  Vehicle_id.

Additional data types to represent common database types, such as date, time, and other concepts, are also employed.\\nMathematically, an attribute A of entity set E whose value set is V can be defined as \\na function  from E to the power set\\n6 P(V) of V:\\nA : E → P(V)\\nWe refer to the value of attribute A for entity e as A(e). The previous definition cov-\\ners both single-valued and multivalued attributes, as well as NULLs . A NULL  value  \\nis represented by the empty set . For single-valued attributes, A(e) is restricted to \\nbeing a singleton set  for each entity e in E, whereas there is no restriction on multi-\\nvalued attributes.7 For a composite attribute A, the value set V is the power set of \\nthe Cartesian product of P(V1), P(V2),\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0, P(Vn), where V1, V2,\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0, Vn are the \\nvalue sets of the simple component attributes that form A:\\nV\\xa0=\\xa0P(P(V1)\\xa0×\\xa0P(V2)\\xa0×\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0.\\xa0×\\xa0P(Vn))\\nThe value set provides all possible values. Usually only a small number of these val-\\nues exist in the database at a particular time. Those values represent the data from the current state of the miniworld and correspond to the data as it actually exists in the miniworld.\\n3.3.3 Initial Conceptual Design of the COMPANY Database\\nWe can now define the entity types for the COMPANY  database, based on the \\nrequirements described in Section 3.2. After defining several entity types and their attributes here, we refine our design in Section 3.4 after we introduce the concept of a relationship. According to the requirements listed in Section 3.2, we can identify four entity types—one corresponding to each of the four items in the specification (see Figure 3.8):\\n \\n1. An entity type DEPARTMENT  with attributes Name , Number , Locations ,  \\nManager , and Manager_start_date . Locations  is the only multivalued attribute. \\nWe can specify that both Name  and Number  are (separate) key attributes \\nbecause each was specified to be unique.\\n 2. An entity type PROJECT  with attributes Name , Number , Location , and \\n Controlling_department . Both Name  and Number  are (separate) key  attributes.\\n 3. An entity type EMPLOYEE  with attributes Name , Ssn, Sex, Address , Salary , \\nBirth_date , Department , and Supervisor . Both Name  and Address  may be  \\ncomposite attributes; however, this was not specified in the requirements. We must go back to the users to see if any of them will refer to the individual components of \\nName —First_name , Middle_initial , Last_name —or of Address .

For example, the attribute \\nManager  of DEPARTMENT  refers to  \\nan employee who manages the department; the attribute Controlling_department   \\nof PROJECT  refers to the department that controls the project; the attribute  \\nSupervisor  of EMPLOYEE  refers to another employee (the one who supervises this \\nemployee); the attribute Department  of EMPLOYEE  refers to the department for \\nwhich the employee works; and so on. In the ER model, these references should not be represented as attributes but as relationships . The initial \\nCOMPANY  database \\nschema from Figure 3.8 will be refined in Section 3.6 to represent relationships explicitly. In the initial design of entity types, relationships are typically captured in the form of attributes. As the design is refined, these attributes get converted into relationships between entity types.\\nThis section is organized as follows: Section 3.4.1 introduces the concepts of rela-\\ntionship types, relationship sets, and relationship instances. We define the concepts of relationship degree, role names, and recursive relationships in Section 3.4.2, and then we discuss structural constraints on relationships—such as cardinality ratios and existence dependencies—in Section 3.4.3. Section 3.4.4 shows how relationship types can also have attributes.\\n3.4.1 Relationship Types, Sets, and Instances\\nA relationship type  R among n entity types E1, E2, .\\xa0.\\xa0. , En defines a set of associa-\\ntions—or a relationship set —among entities from these entity types. Similar to the \\ncase of entity types and entity sets, a relationship type and its corresponding rela-\\ntionship set are customarily referred to by the same name , R. Mathematically, the \\nrelationship set R is a set of relationship instances  ri, where each ri associates n \\nindividual entities ( e1, e2, .\\xa0.\\xa0. , en), and each entity ej in ri is a member of entity set Ej, \\n1 ≤ j ≤ n. Hence, a relationship set is a mathematical relation on E1, E2, .\\xa0.\\xa0. , En; \\n alternatively, it can be defined as a subset of the Cartesian product of the entity sets \\nE1 × E2 × .\\xa0.\\xa0. × En. Each of the entity types E1, E2, .\\xa0.\\xa0. , En is said to participate  in the \\nrelationship type R; similarly, each of the individual entities e1, e2, .\\xa0.\\xa0. , en is said to \\nparticipate  in the relationship instance ri = (e1, e2, .\\xa0.\\xa0. , en).\\nInformally, each relationship instance ri in R is an association of entities, where the \\nassociation includes exactly one entity from each participating entity type. Each \\nsuch relationship instance ri represents the fact that the entities participating in ri \\nare related in some way in the corresponding miniworld situation. For example, \\nconsider a relationship type WORKS_FOR  between the two entity types'),\n",

Each relationship instance in the relationship set \\nWORKS_FOR  associates one EMPLOYEE  entity and one DEPARTMENT   \\nentity. Figure 3.9 illustrates this example, where each relationship instance ri is \\nshown connected to the EMPLOYEE  and DEPARTMENT  entities that participate  \\nin ri. In the miniworld represented by Figure 3.9, the employees e1, e3, and e6 work \\nfor department d1; the employees e2 and e4 work for department d2; and the employ-\\nees e5 and e7 work for department d3.\\nIn ER diagrams, relationship types are displayed as diamond-shaped boxes, which \\nare connected by straight lines to the rectangular boxes representing the participat-ing entity types.

An example of a ternary relationship is SUPPLY , shown in Fig-\\nure\\xa03.10, where each relationship instance ri associates three entities—a supplier s, a \\npart p, and a project j—whenever s supplies part p to project j.

It is sometimes convenient to think of a binary rela-\\ntionship type in terms of attributes, as we discussed in Section 3.3.3. Consider the \\nWORKS_FOR  relationship type in Figure 3.9. One can think of an attribute called \\nDepartment  of the EMPLOYEE  entity type, where the value of Department  for each \\nEMPLOYEE  entity is (a reference to) the DEPARTMENT  entity for which that  \\nemployee works. Hence, the value set for this Department  attribute is the set of all \\nDEPARTMENT  entities, which is the DEPARTMENT  entity set. This is what we did in \\nFigure 3.8 when we specified the initial design of the entity type EMPLOYEE  for the \\nCOMPANY  database. However, when we think of a binary relationship as an attribute, \\nwe always have two options or two points of view. In this example, the alternative point of view is to think of a multivalued attribute \\nEmployees  of the entity type  \\nDEPARTMENT  whose value for each DEPARTMENT  entity is the set of EMPLOYEE  enti-\\nties who work for that department. The value set of this Employees  attribute is the power \\nset of the EMPLOYEE  entity set. Either of these two attributes— Department  of \\nEMPLOYEE  or Employees  of DEPARTMENT —can represent the WORKS_FOR  relation-\\nship type. If both are represented, they are constrained to be inverses of each other.8SUPPLIER\\nPARTSUPPLY PROJECT\\np1\\np2\\np3r1\\nr2\\nr3\\nr4\\nr5\\nr6\\nr7j1\\nj2\\nj3s1\\ns2\\nFigure 3.10\\nSome relationship instances in the  SUPPLY ternary \\n relationship set.\\n8This concept of representing relationship types as attributes is used in a class of data models called \\nfunctional data models .

Each entity type that participates \\nin a relationship type plays a particular role in the relationship. The role name  sig-\\nnifies the role that a participating entity from the entity type plays in each relation-ship instance, and it helps to explain what the relationship means. For example, in the \\nWORKS_FOR  relationship type, EMPLOYEE  plays the role of employee  or worker  \\nand DEPARTMENT  plays the role of department  or employer .\\nRole names are not technically necessary in relationship types where all the partici-\\npating entity types are distinct, since each participating entity type name can be used as the role name. However, in some cases the same  entity type participates more than \\nonce in a relationship type in different roles . In such cases the role name becomes \\nessential for distinguishing the meaning of the role that each participating entity plays. Such relationship types are called recursive relationships  or self-referencing \\nrelationships . Figure 3.11 shows an example. The \\nSUPERVISION  relationship type \\nrelates an employee to a supervisor, where both employee and supervisor entities are members of the same \\nEMPLOYEE  entity set. Hence, the EMPLOYEE  entity type  \\nparticipates twice  in SUPERVISION : once in the role of supervisor  (or boss), and  \\nonce in the role of supervisee  (or subordinate ). Each relationship instance ri in \\nSUPERVISION  associates two different employee entities ej and ek, one of which  \\nplays the role of supervisor and the other the role of supervisee. In Figure 3.11, the \\nlines marked ‘1’ represent the supervisor role, and those marked ‘2’ represent the \\nsupervisee role; hence, e1 supervises e2 and e3, e4 supervises e6 and e7, and e5 super-\\nvises e1 and e4. In this example, each relationship instance must be connected with \\ntwo lines, one marked with ‘1’ (supervisor) and the other with ‘2’ (supervisee).\\nEMPLOYEE\\n2\\n2\\n2SUPERVISION\\ne1\\ne2\\ne3\\ne4\\ne5\\ne6\\ne7r1\\nr2\\nr3\\nr4\\nr5\\nr62\\n2\\n21\\n1\\n11\\n1\\n1Figure 3.11\\nA recursive relationship SUPERVISION between EMPLOYEE in the supervisor  role \\n(1) and EMPLOYEE in the subordinate  role (2).'),\n",

These constraints are determined from the miniworld situation that the relationships rep-resent. For example, in Figure 3.9, if the company has a rule that each employee must work for exactly one department, then we would like to describe this con-straint in the schema. We can distinguish two main types of binary relationship constraints: cardinality ratio  and participation .\\nCardinality Ratios for Binary Relationships. The cardinality ratio  for a binary \\nrelationship specifies the maximum  number of relationship instances that an entity \\ncan participate in. For example, in the \\nWORKS_FOR  binary relationship type, \\nDEPARTMENT :EMPLOYEE  is of cardinality ratio 1:N, meaning that each department \\ncan be related to (that is, employs) any number of employees (N),9 but an employee \\ncan be related to (work for) at most one department (1). This means that for  this particular relationship type \\nWORKS_FOR , a particular department entity can \\nbe related to any number of employees (N indicates there is no maximum number). On the other hand, an employee can be related to a maximum of one department. The possible cardinality ratios for binary relationship types are 1:1, 1:N, N:1,  and M:N.\\nAn example of a 1:1 binary relationship is \\nMANAGES  (Figure 3.12), which relates a \\ndepartment entity to the employee who manages that department. This represents the miniworld constraints that—at any point in time—an employee can manage at \\n9N stands for any number  of related entities (zero or more). In some notations, the asterisk symbol (*) is \\nused instead of N.EMPLOYEE MANAGES DEPART MENT\\ne1\\ne2\\ne3\\ne4\\ne5\\ne6\\ne7d1\\nd2\\nd3r1\\nr2\\nr3Figure 3.12\\nA 1:1 relationship, MANAGES.'),\n",

The rela-\\ntionship type WORKS_ON  (Figure 3.13) is of cardinality ratio M:N, because the \\nminiworld rule is that an employee can work on several projects and a project can have several employees.\\nCardinality ratios for binary relationships are represented on ER diagrams by dis-\\nplaying 1, M, and N on the diamonds as shown in Figure 3.2. Notice that in this notation, we can either specify no maximum (N) or a maximum of one (1) on par-ticipation. An alternative notation (see Section 3.7.4) allows the designer to specify a specific maximum number  on participation, such as 4 or 5.\\nParticipation Constraints and Existence Dependencies. The participation \\nconstraint  specifies whether the existence of an entity depends on its being related \\nto another entity via the relationship type. This constraint specifies the minimum  \\nnumber of relationship instances that each entity can participate in and is some-\\ntimes called the minimum cardinality constraint . There are two types of participa-\\ntion constraints—total and partial—that we illustrate by example. If a company \\npolicy states that every  employee must work for a department, then an employee \\nentity can exist only if it participates in at least one \\nWORKS_FOR  relationship \\ninstance (Figure 3.9). Thus, the participation of EMPLOYEE  in WORKS_FOR  is \\ncalled total participation , meaning that every entity in the total set  of employee \\nentities must be related to a department entity via WORKS_FOR . Total participation \\nis also called existence dependency . In Figure 3.12 we do not expect every  \\nemployee to manage a department, so the participation of EMPLOYEE  in the  EMPLOYEE WORKS_ON PROJECT\\ne1\\ne2\\ne3\\ne4r1\\nr2\\nr3\\nr4\\nr5\\nr6\\nr7p1\\np2\\np3\\np4\\nFigure 3.13\\nAn M:N relationship, WORKS_ON.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 108}, page_content='78 Chapter 3 Data Modeling Using the Entity–Relationship (ER) Model\\nMANAGES  relationship type is partial , meaning that some  or part of the set of  \\nemployee entities are related to some department entity via MANAGES , but not \\n necessarily all. We will refer to the cardinality ratio and participation constraints, taken together, as the structural constraints  of a relationship type.\\nIn ER diagrams, total participation (or existence dependency) is displayed as a double \\nline connecting the participating entity type to the relationship, whereas partial par-\\nticipation is represented by a single line  (see Figure 3.2). Notice that in this notation, \\nwe can either specify no minimum (partial participation) or a minimum of one (total participation). An alternative notation (see Section 3.7.4) allows the designer to spec-ify a specific minimum number  on participation in the relationship, such as 4 or 5.\\nWe will discuss constraints on higher-degree relationships in Section 3.9.\\n3.4.4 Attributes of Relationship Types\\nRelationship types can also have attributes, similar to those of entity types. For \\nexample, to record the number of hours per week that a particular employee works \\non a particular project, we can include an attribute Hours  for the WORKS_ON   \\nrelationship type in Figure 3.13. Another example is to include the date on which  \\na manager started managing a department via an attribute Start_date  for the  \\nMANAGES  relationship type in Figure 3.12.\\nNotice that attributes of 1:1 or 1:N relationship types can be migrated to one of the \\nparticipating entity types. For example, the Start_date  attribute for the MANAGES  \\nrelationship can be an attribute of either EMPLOYEE (manager)  or DEPARTMENT , \\nalthough conceptually it belongs to MANAGES . This is because MANAGES  is a 1:1 \\nrelationship, so every department or employee entity participates in at most one  \\nrelationship instance. Hence, the value of the Start_date  attribute can be determined \\nseparately, either by the participating department entity or by the participating \\nemployee (manager) entity.\\nFor a 1:N relationship type, a relationship attribute can be migrated only  to the \\nentity type on the N-side of the relationship. For example, in Figure 3.9, if the \\nWORKS_FOR  relationship also has an attribute Start_date  that indicates when an \\nemployee started working for a department, this attribute can be included as an attribute of \\nEMPLOYEE . This is because each employee works for at most one \\ndepartment, and hence participates in at most one relationship instance in  \\nWORKS_FOR, but a department can have many employees, each with a different start date . \\nIn both 1:1 and 1:N relationship types, the decision where to place a relationship \\nattribute—as a relationship type attribute or as an attribute of a participating entity \\ntype—is determined subjectively by the schema designer.\\nFor M:N (many-to-many) relationship types, some attributes may be determined \\nby the combination of participating entities  in a relationship instance, not by any \\nsingle entity. Such attributes must be specified as relationship attributes . An example \\nis the Hours  attribute of the M:N relationship WORKS_ON  (Figure 3.13); the  number \\nof hours per week an employee currently works on a project is determined by an \\nemployee-project combination and not separately by either entity.'),\n",

In \\ncontrast, regular entity types  that do have a key attribute—which include all the exam-\\nples discussed so far—are called strong entity types . Entities belonging to a weak entity \\ntype are identified by being related to specific entities from another entity type in com-bination with one of their attribute values. We call this other entity type the identifying  \\nor owner entity type ,\\n10 and we call the relationship type that relates a weak entity type \\nto its owner the identifying relationship  of the weak entity type.11 A weak entity type \\nalways has a total participation constraint  (existence dependency) with respect to its \\nidentifying relationship because a weak entity cannot be identified without an owner entity. However, not every existence dependency results in a weak entity type. For example, a \\nDRIVER_LICENSE  entity cannot exist unless it is related to a PERSON  entity, \\neven though it has its own key (License_number)  and hence is not a weak entity.\\nConsider the entity type DEPENDENT , related to EMPLOYEE , which is used to keep \\ntrack of the dependents of each employee via a 1:N relationship (Figure 3.2). In our example, the attributes of \\nDEPENDENT  are Name  (the first name of the dependent), \\nBirth_date , Sex, and Relationship  (to the employee). Two dependents of two distinct \\nemployees  may, by chance, have the same values for Name , Birth_date , Sex, and  \\nRelationship , but they are still distinct entities. They are identified as distinct entities \\nonly after determining the particular employee entity  to which each dependent is \\nrelated. Each employee entity is said to own the dependent entities that are related to it.\\nA weak entity type normally has a partial key , which is the attribute that can \\nuniquely identify weak entities that are related to the same owner entity .12 In our \\nexample, if we assume that no two dependents of the same employee ever have the same first name, the \\nattribute  Name of DEPENDENT  is the partial key. In the worst \\ncase, a composite attribute of all the weak entity’s attributes  will be the partial key.\\nIn ER diagrams, both a weak entity type and its identifying relationship are distin-\\nguished by surrounding their boxes and diamonds with double lines (see Fig-ure\\xa03.2). The partial key attribute is underlined with a dashed or dotted line.\\nWeak entity types can sometimes be represented as complex (composite, multival-\\nued) attributes. In the preceding example, we could specify a multivalued attribute \\nDependents  for EMPLOYEE , which is a multivalued composite attribute with the \\ncomponent attributes Name , Birth_date , Sex, and Relationship . The choice of which \\nrepresentation to use is made by the database designer. One criterion that may be used is to choose the weak entity type representation if the weak entity type partici-pates independently in relationship types other than its identifying relationship type.\\nIn general, any number of levels of weak entity types can be defined; an owner \\nentity type may itself be a weak entity type. In addition, a weak entity type may have more than one identifying entity type and an identifying relationship type of degree higher than two, as we illustrate in Section 3.9.\\n10The identifying entity type is also sometimes called the parent entity type  or the dominant entity type .\\n11The weak entity type is also sometimes called the child entity type  or the subordinate entity type .\\n12The partial key is sometimes called the discriminator .'),\n",

The cardinality ratio and participa-tion constraint of each relationship type are determined from the requirements listed in Section 3.2. If some cardinality ratio or dependency cannot be determined from the requirements, the users must be questioned further to determine these structural constraints.\\nIn our example, we specify the following relationship types:\\n■ MANAGES , which is a 1:1(one-to-one) relationship type between EMPLOYEE  \\nand DEPARTMENT . EMPLOYEE  participation is partial. DEPARTMENT   \\nparticipation is not clear from the requirements. We question the users, who say that a department must have a manager at all times, which implies total participation.\\n13 The attribute Start_date  is assigned to this relationship type.\\n■ WORKS_FOR , a 1:N (one-to-many) relationship type between  \\nDEPARTMENT  and EMPLOYEE . Both participations are total.\\n■ CONTROLS , a 1:N relationship type between DEPARTMENT  and PROJECT . \\nThe participation of PROJECT  is total, whereas that of DEPARTMENT  is deter-\\nmined to be partial, after consultation with the users indicates that some departments may control no projects.\\n■ SUPERVISION , a 1:N relationship type between EMPLOYEE  (in the supervi-\\nsor role) and EMPLOYEE  (in the supervisee role). Both participations are \\ndetermined to be partial, after the users indicate that not every employee is a supervisor and not every employee has a supervisor.\\n■ WORKS_ON , determined to be an M:N (many-to-many) relationship type \\nwith attribute Hours , after the users indicate that a project can have several \\nemployees working on it. Both participations are determined to be total.\\n■ DEPENDENTS_OF , a 1:N relationship type between EMPLOYEE  and  \\nDEPENDENT , which is also the identifying relationship for the weak entity \\ntype DEPENDENT . The participation of EMPLOYEE  is partial, whereas that of \\nDEPENDENT  is total.\\nAfter specifying the previous six relationship types, we remove from the entity types in \\nFigure 3.8 all attributes that have been refined into relationships. These include Manager  \\nand Manager_start_date  from DEPARTMENT ; Controlling_department  from  \\nPROJECT ; Department , Supervisor , and Works_on  from EMPLOYEE ; and Employee  from \\nDEPENDENT . It is important to have the least possible redundancy when we design the \\nconceptual schema of a database. If some redundancy is\\xa0desired at the storage level or at the user view level, it can be introduced later, as discussed in Section 1.6.1.\\n13The rules in the miniworld that determine the constraints are sometimes called the business rules , \\nsince they are determined by the business  or organization that will utilize the database.'),\n",

In ER diagrams the emphasis is on repre-senting the schemas rather than the instances. This is more useful in database design because a database schema changes rarely, whereas the contents of the entity sets may change frequently. In addition, the schema is obviously easier to display, because it is much smaller.\\nFigure 3.2 displays the \\nCOMPANY  ER database schema  as an ER diagram . We now \\nreview the full ER diagram notation. Regular (strong) entity types such as \\nEMPLOYEE , DEPARTMENT , and PROJECT  are shown in rectangular boxes. Relation-\\nship types such as WORKS_FOR , MANAGES , CONTROLS , and WORKS_ON  are \\nshown in diamond-shaped boxes attached to the participating entity types with straight lines. Attributes are shown in ovals, and each attribute is attached by a straight line to its entity type or relationship type. Component attributes of a composite attri-bute are attached to the oval representing the composite attribute, as illustrated by the \\nName  attribute of EMPLOYEE . Multivalued attributes are shown in double ovals, as \\nillustrated by the Locations  attribute of DEPARTMENT . Key attributes have their names \\nunderlined. Derived attributes are shown in dotted ovals, as illustrated by the  \\nNumber_of_employees  attribute of DEPARTMENT .\\nWeak entity types are distinguished by being placed in double rectangles and by \\nhaving their identifying relationship placed in double diamonds, as illustrated by the \\nDEPENDENT  entity type and the DEPENDENTS_OF  identifying relationship type. \\nThe partial key of the weak entity type is underlined with a dotted line.\\nIn Figure 3.2 the cardinality ratio of each binary  relationship type is specified  \\nby attaching a 1, M, or N on each participating edge. The cardinality ratio  of \\nDEPARTMENT:EMPLOYEE  in MANAGES  is 1:1, whereas it is 1:N for  \\nDEPARTMENT: EMPLOYEE  in WORKS_FOR , and M:N for WORKS_ON . The partici-\\npation constraint is specified by a single line for partial participation and by double lines for total participation (existence dependency).\\nIn Figure 3.2 we show the role names for the \\nSUPERVISION  relationship type \\nbecause the same EMPLOYEE  entity type plays two distinct roles in that relation-\\nship. Notice that the cardinality ratio is 1:N from supervisor to supervisee because \\neach employee in the role of supervisee has at most one direct supervisor, whereas an employee in the role of supervisor can supervise zero or more employees.\\nFigure 3.14 summarizes the conventions for ER diagrams.

One should choose names that convey, as much as possible, the meanings attached to the different constructs in the schema. We choose to use singular names  for entity \\ntypes, rather than plural ones, because the entity type name applies to each indi-vidual entity belonging to that entity type. In our ER diagrams, we will use the con-vention that entity type and relationship type names are in uppercase letters, attribute names have their initial letter capitalized, and role names are in lowercase letters. We have used this convention in Figure 3.2.\\nAs a general practice, given a narrative description of the database requirements, \\nthe nouns  appearing in the narrative tend to give rise to entity type names, and the \\nverbs  tend to indicate names of relationship types. Attribute names generally arise \\nfrom additional nouns that describe the nouns corresponding to entity types.\\nAnother naming consideration involves choosing binary relationship names to \\nmake the ER diagram of the schema readable from left to right and from top to bot-tom. We have generally followed this guideline in Figure 3.2. To explain this nam-ing convention further, we have one exception to the convention in Figure 3.2—the \\nDEPENDENTS_OF  relationship type, which reads from bottom to top. When we \\ndescribe this relationship, we can say that the DEPENDENT  entities (bottom entity \\ntype) are DEPENDENTS_OF  (relationship name) an EMPLOYEE  (top entity type). To \\nchange this to read from top to bottom, we could rename the relationship type to \\nHAS_DEPENDENTS , which would then read as follows: An EMPLOYEE  entity (top \\nentity type) HAS_DEPENDENTS  (relationship name) of type DEPENDENT  (bottom \\nentity type). Notice that this issue arises because each binary relationship can be described starting from either of the two participating entity types, as discussed in the beginning of Section 3.4.\\n3.7.3 Design Choices for ER Conceptual Design\\nIt is occasionally difficult to decide whether a particular concept in the miniworld should be modeled as an entity type, an attribute, or a relationship type. In this  section, we give some brief guidelines as to which construct should be chosen in particular situations.\\nIn general, the schema design process should be considered an iterative refinement \\nprocess, where an initial design is created and then iteratively refined until the most suitable design is reached. Some of the refinements that are often used include the following:\\n■ A concept may be first modeled as an attribute and then refined into a rela-\\ntionship because it is determined that the attribute is a reference to another entity type. It is often the case that a pair of such attributes that are inverses of one another are refined into a binary relationship. We discussed this type of refinement in detail in Section 3.6. It is important to note that in our  notation,'),\n",

For example, suppose that each of several entity types in a \\nUNIVERSITY  database, such as STUDENT , \\nINSTRUCTOR , and COURSE , has an attribute Department in the  \\ninitial design; the designer may then choose to create an entity type  \\nDEPARTMENT  with a single attribute Dept_name  and relate it to the three \\nentity types ( STUDENT , INSTRUCTOR , and COURSE ) via appropriate rela-\\ntionships. Other attributes/relationships of DEPARTMENT  may be discov-\\nered later.\\n■ An inverse refinement to the previous case may be applied—for example, if \\nan entity type DEPARTMENT  exists in the initial design with a single attribute \\nDept_name  and is related to only one other entity type, STUDENT . In  \\nthis case, DEPARTMENT  may be reduced or demoted to an attribute of  \\nSTUDENT .\\n■ Section 3.9 discusses choices concerning the degree of a relationship. In Chap-\\nter 4, we discuss other refinements concerning specialization/generalization.\\n3.7.4 Alternative Notations for ER Diagrams\\nThere are many alternative diagrammatic notations for displaying ER diagrams. Appendix A gives some of the more popular notations. In Section 3.8, we introduce \\nthe Unified Modeling Language (UML) notation for class diagrams, which has been proposed as a standard for conceptual object modeling.\\nIn this section, we describe one alternative ER notation for specifying structural \\nconstraints on relationships, which replaces the cardinality ratio (1:1, 1:N, M:N) and single/double-line notation for participation constraints. This notation involves associating a pair of integer numbers (min, max) with each participation  \\nof an entity type E in a relationship type R, where 0 ≤ min ≤ max and max ≥ 1. The \\nnumbers mean that for each entity e in E, e must participate in at least min and at \\nmost max  relationship instances in R at any point in time . In this method,  \\nmin = 0 implies partial participation, whereas min > 0 implies total participation.\\nFigure 3.15 displays the \\nCOMPANY  database schema using the (min, max) nota-\\ntion.14 Usually, one uses either the cardinality ratio/single-line/double-line nota-\\ntion or the (min, max) notation. The (min, max) notation is more precise, and we \\ncan use it to specify some structural constraints for relationship types of higher \\ndegree . However, it is not sufficient for specifying some key constraints on higher-\\ndegree relationships, as discussed in Section 3.9.\\nFigure 3.15 also displays all the role names for the COMPANY database schema.\\n14In some notations, particularly those used in object modeling methodologies such as UML, the (min, \\nmax) is placed on the opposite sides  to the ones we have shown. For example, for the WORKS_FOR   \\nrelationship in Figure 3.15, the (1,1) would be on the DEPARTMENT  side, and the (4,N) would be on the \\nEMPLOYEE  side. Here we used the original notation from Abrial (1974).'),\n",

Figure 3.16 \\nshows how the COMPANY  ER database schema in Figure 3.15 can be displayed \\nusing UML class diagram notation. The entity types  in Figure 3.15 are modeled as \\nclasses  in Figure 3.16. An entity  in ER corresponds to an object  in UML.\\nIn UML class diagrams, a class  (similar to an entity type in ER) is displayed as a box \\n(see Figure 3.16) that includes three sections: The top section gives the class name  \\n(similar to entity type name); the middle section includes the attributes ; and the \\nlast section includes operations  that can be applied to individual objects (similar to \\nindividual entities in an entity set) of the class. Operations are not specified in ER \\ndiagrams. Consider the EMPLOYEE  class in Figure 3.16. Its attributes are Name , Ssn, \\nBdate , Sex, Address , and Salary . The designer can optionally specify the domain  (or \\ndata type) of an attribute if desired, by placing a colon (:) followed by the domain \\nname or description, as illustrated by the Name , Sex, and Bdate  attributes  \\nof EMPLOYEE  in Figure 3.16. A composite attribute is modeled as a  \\nstructured domain , as illustrated by the Name  attribute of EMPLOYEE . A multival-\\nued attribute will generally be modeled as a separate class, as illustrated by the \\nLOCATION  class in Figure 3.16.superviseeName: Name_dom\\nFnameMinit\\nLname\\nSsnBdate: DateSex: {M,F}\\nAddressSalary4.. *\\n1.. *\\n1.. * **1..1\\n1..1\\n1..1\\n1..11.. *0..1\\n0.. *\\n0.. *age\\nchange_departmentchange_projects. . .\\nSex: {M,F}\\nBirth_date: DateRelationshipDEPENDENT\\n. . .0..1\\nsupervisorDependent_nameEMPLOYEE\\nName\\nNumber\\nadd_employee\\nnumber_of_employeeschange_manager. . .DEPART MENT\\nName\\nNumber\\nadd_employee\\nadd_projectchange_manager. . .PROJECTStart_dateMANAGES\\nCONTROLS\\nHoursWORKS_ONNameLOCATION1..1\\n0.. *0..1Multiplicity\\nNotation in O MT:\\nAggregation\\nNotation in U ML:\\nWhole PartWORKS_FOR\\nFigure 3.16\\nThe COMPANY conceptual schema in UML class diagram notation.'),\n",

A binary association  (binary relationship type) is repre-\\nsented as a line connecting the participating classes (entity types), and may option-ally have a name. A relationship attribute, called a link attribute , is placed in a box \\nthat is connected to the association’s line by a dashed line. The (min, max) notation described in Section 3.7.4 is used to specify relationship constraints, which are called multiplicities  in UML terminology. Multiplicities are specified in the form \\nmin..max , and an asterisk (*) indicates no maximum limit on participation. How-\\never, the multiplicities are placed on the opposite ends of the relationship  when com-\\npared with the (min, max) notation discussed in Section 3.7.4 (compare Fig - ures 3.15 and 3.16). In UML, a single asterisk indicates a multiplicity of 0 ..*, and a single 1 indicates a multiplicity of 1..1. A recursive relationship type (see Section 3.4.2) \\nis called a reflexive association  in UML, and the role names—like the multiplicities—\\nare placed at the opposite ends of an association when compared with the placing of role names in Figure 3.15.\\nIn UML, there are two types of relationships: association and aggregation. \\n Aggregation  is meant to represent a relationship between a whole object and its com-\\nponent parts, and it has a distinct diagrammatic notation. In Figure 3.16, we modeled the locations of a department and the single location of a project as aggregations. However, aggregation and association do not have different structural properties, and the choice as to which type of relationship to use—aggregation or association—is somewhat subjective. In the ER model, both are represented as relationships.\\nUML also distinguishes between unidirectional  and bidirectional  associations \\n(or aggregations). In the unidirectional case, the line connecting the classes is dis-played with an arrow to indicate that only one direction for accessing related objects is needed. If no arrow is displayed, the bidirectional case is assumed, which is the default. For example, if we always expect to access the manager of a depart-ment starting from a \\nDEPARTMENT  object, we would draw the association line rep-\\nresenting the MANAGES  association with an arrow from DEPARTMENT  to \\nEMPLOYEE . In addition, relationship instances may be specified to be ordered .  \\nFor example, we could specify that the employee objects related to each depart-\\nment through the WORKS_FOR  association (relationship) should be ordered by \\ntheir Start_date  attribute value. Association (relationship) names are optional  in \\nUML, and relationship attributes are displayed in a box attached with a dashed \\nline to the line representing the association/aggregation (see Start_date  and Hours  \\nin Figure 3.16).\\nThe operations given in each class are derived from the functional requirements of \\nthe application, as we discussed in Section 3.1. It is generally sufficient to specify the \\noperation names initially for the logical operations that are expected to be applied \\nto individual objects of a class, as shown in Figure 3.16. As the design is refined, \\nmore details are added, such as the exact argument types (parameters) for each \\noperation, plus a functional description of each operation. UML has function \\ndescriptions  and sequence diagrams  to specify some of the operation details, but \\nthese are beyond the scope of our discussion.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 118}, page_content='88 Chapter 3 Data Modeling Using the Entity–Relationship (ER) Model\\nWeak entities can be modeled using the UML construct called qualified association  \\n(or qualified aggregation ); this can represent both the identifying relationship  \\nand the partial key, which is placed in a box attached to the owner class. This is illustrated by the \\nDEPENDENT  class and its qualified aggregation to EMPLOYEE  in \\nFigure 3.16. In UML terminology, the partial key attribute Dependent_name  is called \\nthe discriminator , because its value distinguishes the objects associated with \\n(related to) the same EMPLOYEE entity . Qualified associations are not restricted to \\nmodeling weak entities, and they can be used to model other situations in UML.\\nThis section is not meant to be a complete description of UML class diagrams, but \\nrather to illustrate one popular type of alternative diagrammatic notation that can be used for representing ER modeling concepts.\\n3.9  Relationship Types of Degree  \\nHigher than Two\\nIn Section 3.4.2 we defined the degree  of a relationship type as the number of par-\\nticipating entity types and called a relationship type of degree two binary  and a \\nrelationship type of degree three ternary . In this section, we elaborate on the differ-\\nences between binary and higher-degree relationships, when to choose higher-degree versus binary relationships, and how to specify constraints on higher-degree relationships.\\n3.9.1  Choosing between Binary and Ternary  \\n(or Higher-Degree) Relationships\\nThe ER diagram notation for a ternary relationship type is shown in Figure 3.17(a), \\nwhich displays the schema for the SUPPLY  relationship type that was displayed at the \\ninstance level in Figure 3.10. Recall that the relationship set of SUPPLY  is a set of rela-\\ntionship instances ( s, j, p), where the meaning is that s is a SUPPLIER  who is currently \\nsupplying a PART  p to a PROJECT  j. In general, a relationship type R of degree n will \\nhave n edges in an ER diagram, one connecting R to each participating entity type.\\nFigure 3.17(b) shows an ER diagram for three binary relationship types CAN_SUPPLY , \\nUSES , and SUPPLIES . In general, a ternary relationship type represents different \\ninformation than do three binary relationship types. Consider the three binary relationship types \\nCAN_SUPPLY , USES , and SUPPLIES . Suppose that  \\nCAN_SUPPLY , between SUPPLIER  and PART , includes an instance ( s, p) whenever \\nsupplier s can supply  part p (to any project); USES, between PROJECT  and PART , \\nincludes an instance ( j, p) whenever project j uses part p; and SUPPLIES , between \\nSUPPLIER  and PROJECT , includes an instance ( s, j) whenever supplier s supplies \\nsome part  to project j. The existence of three relationship instances ( s, p),  \\n(j, p), and ( s, j) in CAN_SUPPLY , USES , and SUPPLIES , respectively, does not neces-\\nsarily imply that an instance ( s, j, p) exists in the ternary relationship SUPPLY , \\nbecause the meaning is different . It is often tricky to decide whether a particular \\nrelationship should be represented as a relationship type of degree n or should be'),\n",

The designer must \\nbase this decision on the semantics or meaning of the particular situation being \\nrepresented.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 120}, page_content='90 Chapter 3 Data Modeling Using the Entity–Relationship (ER) Model\\nSome database design tools are based on variations of the ER model that permit \\nonly binary relationships. In this case, a ternary relationship such as SUPPLY  must \\nbe represented as a weak entity type, with no partial key and with three identifying relationships. The three participating entity types \\nSUPPLIER , PART , and PROJECT  \\nare together the owner entity types (see Figure 3.17(c)). Hence, an entity in the weak entity type \\nSUPPLY  in Figure 3.17(c) is identified by the combination of its \\nthree owner entities from SUPPLIER , PART , and PROJECT .\\nIt is also possible to represent the ternary relationship as a regular entity type by \\nintroducing an artificial or surrogate key. In this example, a key attribute Supply_id  \\ncould be used for the supply entity type, converting it into a regular entity type. Three binary N:1 relationships relate \\nSUPPLY  to each of the three participating \\nentity types.\\nAnother example is shown in Figure 3.18. The ternary relationship type OFFERS  \\nrepresents information on instructors offering courses during particular semesters; hence it includes a relationship instance ( i, s, c) whenever \\nINSTRUCTOR  i offers \\nCOURSE  c during SEMESTER  s. The three binary relationship types shown in Fig-\\nure 3.18 have the following meanings: CAN_TEACH  relates a course to the instruc-\\ntors who can teach  that course, TAUGHT_DURING  relates a semester to the instructors \\nwho taught some course  during that semester, and OFFERED_DURING  relates a \\nsemester to the courses offered during that semester by any instructor . These ter-\\nnary and binary relationships represent different information, but certain  constraints should hold among the relationships. For example, a relationship instance ( i, s, c) should not exist in \\nOFFERS  unless  an instance ( i, s) exists in \\nTAUGHT_DURING , an instance ( s, c) exists in OFFERED_DURING , and an instance  \\n(i, c) exists in CAN_TEACH . However, the reverse is not always true;  \\nwe may have instances ( i, s), (s, c), and ( i, c) in the three binary relationship types \\nwith no corresponding instance ( i, s, c) in OFFERS . Note that in this example,  \\nbased on the meanings of the relationships, we can infer the instances of  \\nTAUGHT_DURING  and OFFERED_DURING  from the instances in OFFERS , but  CnumberCAN_TEACHLname\\nINSTRUCTORSem_yearYear Semester\\nSEMESTER\\nOFFERED_DURING\\nCOURSEOFFERSTAUGHT_DURINGFigure 3.18\\nAnother example of ternary versus binary relationship types.'),\n",

In our example, if the \\nCAN_TEACH  relationship is 1:1 (an instructor can teach only one course, and a \\ncourse can be taught by only one instructor), then the ternary relationship OFFERS  \\ncan be left out because it can be inferred from the three binary relationships  \\nCAN_TEACH , TAUGHT_DURING , and OFFERED_DURING . The schema designer \\nmust analyze the meaning of each specific situation to decide which of the binary and ternary relationship types are needed.\\nNotice that it is possible to have a weak entity type with a ternary (or n-ary) identi-\\nfying relationship type. In this case, the weak entity type can have several  owner \\nentity types. An example is shown in Figure 3.19. This example shows part of a database that keeps track of candidates interviewing for jobs at various companies, which may be part of an employment agency database. In the requirements, a can-didate can have multiple interviews with the same company (for example, with dif-ferent company departments or on separate dates), but a job offer is made based on one of the interviews. Here, \\nINTERVIEW  is represented as a weak entity with two \\nowners CANDIDATE  and COMPANY , and with the partial key Dept_date . An  \\nINTERVIEW  entity is uniquely identified by a candidate, a company, and the combi-\\nnation of the date and department of the interview.\\n3.9.2  Constraints on Ternary (or Higher-Degree)  \\nRelationships\\nThere are two notations for specifying structural constraints on n-ary relationships, \\nand they specify different constraints. They should thus both be used  if it is impor-\\ntant to fully specify the structural constraints on a ternary or higher-degree rela-\\ntionship. The first notation is based on the cardinality ratio notation of binary \\nrelationships displayed in Figure 3.2. Here, a 1, M, or N is specified on each Dept_dateDate Department\\nRESULTS_INName\\nCANDIDATECname\\nCOMPANY\\nINTERVIEW JOB_OFFERCCIFigure 3.19\\nA weak entity type INTERVIEW with a  ternary identifying \\n relationship type.'),\n",

Suppose that the constraint \\nexists that for a particular project-part combination, only one supplier will be used (only one supplier supplies a particular part to a particular project). In this case, we place 1 on the \\nSUPPLIER  participation, and M, N on the PROJECT , PART  participa-\\ntions in Figure 3.17. This specifies the constraint that a particular ( j, p) combination \\ncan appear at most once in the relationship set because each such ( PROJECT , PART ) \\ncombination uniquely determines a single supplier. Hence, any relationship instance ( s, j, p) is uniquely identified in the relationship set by its ( j, p) combina-\\ntion, which makes ( j, p) a key for the relationship set. In this notation, the participa-\\ntions that have a 1 specified on them are not required to be part of the identifying key for the relationship set.\\n16 If all three cardinalities are M or N, then the key will \\nbe the combination of all three participants.\\nThe second notation is based on the (min, max) notation displayed in Figure 3.15 \\nfor binary relationships. A (min, max) on a participation here specifies that each \\nentity is related to at least min and at most max relationship instances  in the rela-\\ntionship set. These constraints have no bearing on determining the key of an n-ary \\nrelationship, where n > 2,17 but specify a different type of constraint that places \\nrestrictions on how many relationship instances each entity can participate in.\\n3.10 Another Example: A U NIVERSITY Database\\nWe now present another example, a UNIVERSITY database, to illustrate the ER \\nmodeling concepts. Suppose that a database is needed to keep track of student enrollments in classes and students’ final grades. After analyzing the miniworld rules and the users’ needs, the requirements for this database were determined to be as follows (for brevity, we show the chosen entity type names and attribute names for the conceptual schema in parentheses as we describe the requirements; relation-ship type names are only shown in the ER schema diagram):\\n■ The university is organized into colleges (COLLEGE), and each college has a \\nunique name (CName), a main office (COffice) and phone (CPhone), and a particular faculty member who is dean of the college. Each college adminis-ters a number of academic departments (DEPT). Each department has a unique name (DName), a unique code number (DCode), a main office (DOffice) and phone (DPhone), and a particular faculty member who chairs the department. We keep track of the start date (CStartDate) when that fac-ulty member began chairing the department.\\n15This notation allows us to determine the key of the relationship relation , as we discuss in Chapter 9.\\n16This is also true for cardinality ratios of binary relationships.\\n17The (min, max) constraints can determine the keys for binary relationships.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 123}, page_content='3.10 Another Example: A UNIVERSITY Database  93\\n■ A department offers a number of courses (COURSE), each of which has a \\nunique course name (CoName), a unique code number (CCode), a course level (Level: this can be coded as 1 for freshman level, 2 for sophomore, 3 for junior, 4 for senior, 5 for MS level, and 6 for PhD level), a course credit hours (Credits), and a course description (CDesc). The database also keeps track of instructors (INSTRUCTOR); and each instructor has a unique iden-tifier (Id), name (IName), office (IOffice), phone (IPhone), and rank (Rank); in addition, each instructor works for one primary academic department.\\n■ The database will keep student data (STUDENT) and stores each student’s \\nname (SName, composed of first name (FName), middle name (MName), last name (LName)), student id (Sid, unique for every student), address (Addr), phone (Phone), major code (Major), and date of birth (DoB). A stu-dent is assigned to one primary academic department. It is required to keep track of the student’s grades in each section the student has completed.\\n■ Courses are offered as sections (SECTION). Each section is related to a single \\ncourse and a single instructor and has a unique section identifier (SecId). A \\nsection also has a section number (SecNo: this is coded as 1, 2, 3, .\\xa0.\\xa0. for mul-\\ntiple sections offered during the same semester/year), semester (Sem), year \\n(Year), classroom (CRoom: this is coded as a combination of building code \\n(Bldg) and room number (RoomNo) within the building), and days/times \\n(DaysTime: for example, ‘MWF 9am-9.50am’ or ‘TR 3.30pm-5.20pm’—\\nrestricted to only allowed days/time values). ( Note : The database will keep \\ntrack of all the sections offered for the past several years, in addition to the current offerings. The SecId is unique for all sections, not just the sections for a particular semester.) The database keeps track of the students in each section, and the grade is recorded when available (this is a many-to-many relationship between students and sections). A section must have at least five students.\\nThe ER diagram for these requirements is shown in Figure 3.20 using the min-max ER \\ndiagrammatic notation. Notice that for the SECTION entity type, we only showed SecID as an underlined key, but because of the miniworld constraints, several other combinations of values have to be unique for each section entity. For example, each of the following combinations must be unique based on the typical miniworld constraints:\\n \\n1. (SecNo, Sem, Year, CCode (of the COURSE related to the SECTION)): This \\nspecifies that the section numbers of a particular course must be different \\nduring each particular semester and year.\\n 2. (Sem, Year, CRoom, DaysTime): This specifies that in a particular semester \\nand year, a classroom cannot be used by two different sections at the same \\ndays/time.\\n 3. (Sem, Year, DaysTime, Id (of the INSTRUCTOR teaching the SECTION)): \\nThis specifies that in a particular semester and year, an instructor cannot \\nteach two sections at the same days/time. Note that this rule will not apply if \\nan instructor is allowed to teach two combined sections together in the par-\\nticular university.\\nCan you think of any other attribute combinations that have to be unique?'),\n",

We discussed weak entity types and the related concepts of owner entity types, identifying relationship types and partial key attributes.\\nEntity–relationship schemas can be represented diagrammatically as ER diagrams. \\nWe showed how to design an ER schema for the \\nCOMPANY  database by first defin-\\ning the entity types and their attributes and then refining the design to include rela-\\ntionship types. We displayed the ER diagram for the COMPANY  database schema. \\nWe discussed some of the basic concepts of UML class diagrams and how they \\nrelate to ER modeling concepts. We also described ternary and higher-degree  \\nrelationship types in more detail, and we discussed the circumstances under which \\nthey are distinguished from binary relationships. Finally, we presented require-ments for a UNIVERSITY database schema as another example, and we showed the ER schema design.\\nThe ER modeling concepts we have presented thus far—entity types, relationship \\ntypes, attributes, keys, and structural constraints—can model many database appli-cations. However, more complex applications—such as engineering design, medi-cal information systems, and telecommunications—require additional concepts if we want to model them with greater accuracy.

Each degree entry contains the degree name and the month and year the degree was awarded, and each transcript entry contains a course name, semester, year, and grade. Design an attribute to hold this informa-tion. Use the conventions in Figure 3.5.\\n 3.18. Show an alternative design for the attribute described in Exercise 3.17 that uses only entity types (including weak entity types, if needed) and relation-ship types.\\n 3.19.

We can consider many entity types to describe such an environment, such as DBMS, stored database, DBA, and catalog/data dictionary.

Multivalued and composite attri-butes are incorporated in the ER model in Elmasri et al. (1985). Although we did not discuss languages for the ER model and its extensions, there have been several proposals for such languages. Elmasri and Wiederhold (1981) proposed the  GORDAS query language for the ER model. Another ER query language was pro-posed by Markowitz and Raz (1983).

Since the late 1970s, however, designers of database applications have tried to design more accurate database schemas that reflect the data properties and constraints more precisely. This was particularly important for newer applications of database technology, such as databases for engineering design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM),\\n1 telecommunications, com-\\nplex software systems, and geographic information systems (GISs), among many other applications. These types of databases have requirements that are more com-plex than the more traditional applications. This led to the development of addi-tional semantic data modeling  concepts that were incorporated into conceptual \\ndata models such as the ER model. Various semantic data models have been pro-posed in the literature. Many of these concepts were also developed independently in related areas of computer science, such as the knowledge representation  area of \\nartificial intelligence and the object modeling  area in software engineering.\\nIn this chapter, we describe features that have been proposed for semantic data \\nmodels and show how the ER model can be enhanced to include these concepts, which leads to the enhanced ER (EER ) model.\\n2 We start in Section 4.1 by incorpo-\\nrating the concepts of class/subclass relationships  and type inheritance  into the ER \\nmodel. Then, in Section 4.2, we add the concepts of specialization  and generalization.  \\nSection 4.3 discusses the various types of constraints  on specialization/generalization, \\nand Section 4.4 shows how the UNION  construct can be modeled by including the chapter 4\\n1CAD/CAM stands for computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing.\\n2EER has also been used to stand for extended  ER model.'),\n",

Section 4.5 gives a sample UNIVERSITY  \\ndatabase schema in the EER model and summarizes the EER model concepts by giving formal definitions. We will use the terms object  and entity  interchangeably \\nin this chapter, because many of these concepts are commonly used in object-oriented models.\\nWe present the UML class diagram notation for representing specialization and \\ngeneralization in Section 4.6, and we briefly compare these with EER notation and \\nconcepts. This serves as an example of alternative notation, and is a continuation of Section 3.8, which presented basic UML class diagram notation that corre-sponds to the basic ER model. In Section 4.7, we discuss the fundamental abstrac-tions that are used as the basis of many semantic data models. Section 4.8 summarizes the chapter.\\nFor a detailed introduction to conceptual modeling, Chapter 4 should be consid-\\nered a continuation of Chapter 3. However, if only a basic introduction to ER mod-eling is desired, this chapter may be omitted. Alternatively, the reader may choose to skip some or all of the later sections of this chapter (Sections 4.4 through 4.8).\\n4.1 Subclasses, Superclasses, and Inheritance\\nThe EER model includes all the modeling concepts of the ER model  that were pre-\\nsented in Chapter 3. In addition, it includes the concepts of subclass  and superclass  \\nand the related concepts of specialization  and generalization  (see Sections 4.2  \\nand 4.3). Another concept included in the EER model is that of a category  or union \\ntype  (see Section 4.4), which is used to represent a collection of objects (entities) \\nthat is the union  of objects of different entity types. Associated with these concepts \\nis the important mechanism of attribute and relationship inheritance . Unfortu-\\nnately, no standard terminology exists for these concepts, so we use the most com-\\nmon terminology. Alternative terminology is given in footnotes. We also describe a \\ndiagrammatic technique for displaying these concepts when they arise in an EER schema. We call the resulting schema diagrams enhanced ER  or EER diagrams .\\nThe first enhanced ER (EER) model concept we take up is that of a subtype  or  \\nsubclass  of an entity type. As we discussed in Chapter 3, the name of an entity type is \\nused to represent both a type of entity  and the entity set  or collection of entities of that \\ntype that exist in the database. For example, the entity type \\nEMPLOYEE  describes the \\ntype (that is, the attributes and relationships) of each employee entity, and also refers \\nto the current set of EMPLOYEE  entities in the COMPANY  database. In many cases an \\nentity type has numerous subgroupings or subtypes of its entities that are meaningful \\nand need to be represented explicitly because of their significance to the database \\napplication. For example, the entities that are members of the EMPLOYEE  entity \\ntype may be distinguished further into SECRETARY , ENGINEER , MANAGER , \\nTECHNICIAN , SALARIED_EMPLOYEE , HOURLY_EMPLOYEE , and so on. The set or \\ncollection of entities in each of the latter groupings is a subset of the entities that \\nbelong to the EMPLOYEE  entity set, meaning that every entity that is a member of \\none of these subgroupings is also an employee. We call each of these subgroupings a'),\n",

Figure 4.1 shows how \\nto represent these concepts diagramatically in EER diagrams. (The circle notation in Figure 4.1 will be explained in Section 4.2.)\\nWe call the relationship between a superclass and any one of its subclasses a  \\nsuperclass/subclass  or supertype/subtype  or simply class/subclass relationship .\\n3 \\nIn our previous example, EMPLOYEE/SECRETARY  and EMPLOYEE/TECHNICIAN  \\nare two class/subclass relationships. Notice that a member entity of the subclass repre sents the same real-world entity  as some member of the superclass; for \\nexample, a \\nSECRETARY  entity ‘Joan Logano’ is also the EMPLOYEE  ‘Joan Logano.’ \\nHence, the subclass member is the same as the entity in the superclass, but in a \\ndistinct specific role.  When we implement a superclass/subclass relationship in \\nthe database system, however, we may represent a member of the subclass as a distinct database object—say, a distinct record that is related via the key attribute to its superclass entity. In Section 9.2, we discuss various options for representing superclass/subclass relationships in relational databases.\\nAn entity cannot exist in the database merely by being a member of a subclass; it \\nmust also be a member of the superclass. Such an entity can be included optionally \\n3A class/subclass relationship is often called an IS-A (or IS-AN ) relationship  because of the way we \\nrefer to the concept.

For example, a salaried employee who is \\nalso an engineer belongs to the two subclasses ENGINEER  and SALARIED_EMPLOYEE  \\nof the EMPLOYEE  entity type. However, it is not necessary that every entity in a \\nsuperclass is a member of some subclass.\\nAn important concept associated with subclasses (subtypes) is that of type  \\ninheritance . Recall that the type of an entity is defined by the attributes it possesses \\nand the relationship types in which it participates. Because an entity in the subclass represents the same real-world entity from the superclass, it should possess values for its specific attributes as well as  values of its attributes as a member of the super-\\nclass. We say that an entity that is a member of a subclass inherits  all the attributes of \\nthe entity as a member of the superclass. The entity also inherits all the relationships in which the superclass participates. Notice that a subclass, with its own specific (or local) attributes and relationships together with all the attributes and relationships it inherits from the superclass, can be considered an entity type  in its own right.\\n4\\n4.2 Specialization and Generalization\\n4.2.1 Specialization\\nSpecialization  is the process of defining a set of subclasses  of an entity type; this \\nentity type is called the superclass  of the specialization. The set of subclasses that \\nforms a specialization is defined on the basis of some distinguishing characteristic of the entities in the superclass. For example, the set of subclasses \\n{SECRETARY, \\nENGINEER, TECHNICIAN}  is a specialization of the superclass EMPLOYEE  that dis-\\ntinguishes among employee entities based on the job type  of each employee.  \\nWe may have several specializations of the same entity type based on different distinguishing characteristics. For example, another specialization of the \\nEMPLOYEE  entity type may yield the set of subclasses {SALARIED_EMPLOYEE,  \\nHOURLY_EMPLOYEE} ; this specialization distinguishes among employees based on \\nthe method of pay.\\nFigure 4.1 shows how we represent a specialization diagrammatically in an EER \\ndiagram. The subclasses that define a specialization are attached by lines to a circle that represents the specialization, which is connected in turn to the superclass. The subset symbol  on each line connecting a subclass to the circle indicates the direction \\nof the superclass/subclass relationship.\\n5 Attributes that apply only to entities of a \\nparticular subclass—such as TypingSpeed  of SECRETARY —are attached to the rect-\\nangle representing that subclass. These are called specific  (or local ) attributes  of \\nthe subclass. Similarly, a subclass can participate in specific relationship types , \\nsuch as the HOURLY_EMPLOYEE  subclass participating in the BELONGS_TO  \\n4In some object-oriented programming languages, a common restriction is that an entity (or object) has \\nonly one type . This is generally too restrictive for conceptual database modeling.\\n5There are many alternative notations for specialization; we present the UML notation in Section 4.6 and \\nother proposed notations in Appendix A.'),\n",

We will explain the d symbol in the circles in Figure 4.1 \\nand additional EER diagram notation shortly.\\nFigure 4.2 shows a few entity instances that belong to subclasses of the {SECRETARY, \\nENGINEER, TECHNICIAN}  specialization. Again, notice that an entity that belongs to \\na subclass represents the same real-world entity  as the entity connected to it in the \\nEMPLOYEE  superclass, even though the same entity is shown twice; for example, e1 \\nis shown in both EMPLOYEE  and SECRETARY  in Figure 4.2. As the figure suggests, \\na superclass/subclass relationship such as EMPLOYEE/SECRETARY  somewhat \\nresembles a 1:1 relationship at the instance level  (see Figure 3.12). The main differ-\\nence is that in a 1:1 relationship two distinct entities  are related, whereas in a super-\\nclass/subclass relationship the entity in the subclass is the same real-world entity as the entity in the superclass but is playing a specialized role— for example, an \\nEMPLOYEE  specialized in the role of SECRETARY , or an EMPLOYEE  specialized in \\nthe role of TECHNICIAN .\\nThere are two main reasons for including class/subclass relationships and special-\\nizations.

The members of the subclass may still share the majority of their attributes with the other members of the superclass. For example, in Figure 4.1 the \\nSECRETARY  subclass has the specific attribute Typing_speed , \\nwhereas the ENGINEER  subclass has the specific attribute Eng_type , but  \\nSECRETARY  and ENGINEER  share their other inherited attributes from the \\nEMPLOYEE  entity type.\\nThe second reason for using subclasses is that some relationship types may be par-\\nticipated in only by entities that are members of the subclass. For example, if only \\nHOURLY_EMPLOYEES  can belong to a trade union, we can represent that fact by \\ncreating the subclass HOURLY_EMPLOYEE  of EMPLOYEE  and relating the subclass \\nto an entity type TRADE_UNION  via the BELONGS_TO  relationship type, as illus-\\ntrated in Figure 4.1.\\n4.2.2 Generalization\\nWe can think of a reverse process  of abstraction in which we suppress the differences \\namong several entity types, identify their common features, and generalize  them \\ninto a single superclass  of which the original entity types are special subclasses . For \\nexample, consider the entity types CAR  and TRUCK  shown in Figure 4.3(a). Because \\nthey have several common attributes, they can be generalized into the entity type \\nVEHICLE , as shown in Figure 4.3(b).

We use the term generalization  to refer to the pro-\\ncess of defining a generalized entity type from the given entity types.\\nNotice that the generalization process can be viewed as being functionally the \\ninverse of the specialization process; we can view {CAR, TRUCK}  as a specialization \\nof VEHICLE  rather than viewing VEHICLE  as a generalization of CAR  and TRUCK . A \\ndiagrammatic notation to distinguish between generalization and specialization is used in some design methodologies. An arrow pointing to the generalized super-class represents a generalization process, whereas arrows pointing to the special-ized subclasses represent a specialization process. We will not use this notation \\nbecause the decision as to which process was followed in a particular situation is often subjective.\\nSo far we have introduced the concepts of subclasses and superclass/subclass rela-\\ntionships, as well as the specialization and generalization processes. In general, a superclass or subclass represents a collection of entities of the same type and hence also describes an entity type ; that is why superclasses and subclasses are all shown in \\nrectangles in EER diagrams, like entity types.\\n4.3  Constraints and Characteristics  \\nof Specialization and Generalization Hierarchies\\nFirst, we discuss constraints that apply to a single specialization or a single general-\\nization. For brevity, our discussion refers only to specialization  even though it \\napplies to both  specialization and generalization. Then, we discuss differences \\nbetween specialization/generalization lattices  (multiple inheritance ) and hierarchies  \\n(single inheritance ), and we elaborate on the differences between the specialization \\nand generalization processes during conceptual database schema design.\\n4.3.1 Constraints on Specialization and Generalization\\nIn general, we may have several specializations defined on the same entity type (or superclass), as shown in Figure 4.1. In such a case, entities may belong to subclasses in each of the specializations. A specialization may also consist of a single  subclass \\nonly, such as the \\n{MANAGER}  specialization in Figure 4.1; in such a case, we do not \\nuse the circle notation.\\nIn some specializations we can determine exactly the entities that will become \\nmembers of each subclass by placing a condition on the value of some attribute of \\nthe superclass. Such subclasses are called predicate-defined  (or condition-defined ) \\nsubclasses . For example, if the EMPLOYEE  entity type has an attribute Job_type , as \\nshown in Figure 4.4, we can specify the condition of membership in the  \\nSECRETARY  subclass by the condition ( Job_type  = ‘Secretary’), which we call the \\ndefining predicate  of the subclass. This condition is a constraint  specifying that \\nexactly those entities of the EMPLOYEE  entity type whose attribute value for Job_type'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 144}, page_content='114 Chapter 4 The Enhanced Entity–Relationship (EER) Model\\nis ‘Secretary’ belong to the subclass. We display a predicate-defined subclass by \\nwriting the predicate condition next to the line that connects the subclass to the specialization circle.\\nIf all subclasses in a specialization have their membership condition on the same  \\nattribute of the superclass, the specialization itself is called an attribute-defined \\nspecialization , and the attribute is called the defining attribute  of the special-\\nization.\\n6 In this case, all the entities with the same value for the attribute belong to \\nthe same subclass. We display an attribute-defined specialization by placing the defining attribute name next to the arc from the circle to the superclass, as shown in Figure 4.4.\\nWhen we do not have a condition for determining membership in a subclass, the \\nsubclass is called user-defined . Membership in such a subclass is determined by the \\ndatabase users when they apply the operation to add an entity to the subclass; hence, membership is specified individually for each entity by the user , not by any condi-\\ntion that may be evaluated automatically.\\nTwo other constraints may apply to a specialization. The first is the disjointness \\nconstraint , which specifies that the subclasses of the specialization must be disjoint \\nsets. This means that an entity can be a member of at most  one of the subclasses of \\nthe specialization. A specialization that is attribute-defined implies the disjointness \\nconstraint (if the attribute used to define the membership predicate is single- \\nvalued). Figure 4.4 illustrates this case, where the d in the circle stands for disjoint . The \\nd notation also applies to user-defined subclasses of a specialization that must be \\ndisjoint, as illustrated by the specialization \\n{HOURLY_EMPLOYEE, SALARIED_EMPLOYEE}  \\nin Figure 4.1. If the subclasses are not constrained to be disjoint, their sets of entities \\n6Such an attribute is called a discriminator  or discriminating attribute  in UML terminology.dMinit Lname\\nName Birth_date Address Job_type SsnFname\\nEng_type Tgrade‘Technician’Job_type\\n‘Secretary’ ‘Engineer’\\nTyping_speed\\nSECRETARY TECHNICIAN ENGINEEREMPLOYEE\\nFigure 4.4 \\nEER diagram notation for an attribute-defined specialization on  Job_type.'),\n",

This case, which is the default, is displayed by placing an o in the circle, as shown in Figure 4.5.\\nThe second constraint on specialization is called the completeness  (or totalness ) \\nconstraint , which may be total or partial. A total specialization  constraint specifies \\nthat every  entity in the superclass must be a member of at least one subclass  \\nin the specialization. For example, if every \\nEMPLOYEE  must be either an  \\nHOURLY_EMPLOYEE  or a SALARIED_EMPLOYEE , then the specialization  \\n{HOURLY_EMPLOYEE, SALARIED_EMPLOYEE}  in Figure 4.1 is a total specialization \\nof EMPLOYEE. This is shown in EER diagrams by using a double line to connect \\nthe superclass to the circle. A single line is used to display a partial specialization , \\nwhich allows an entity not to belong to any of the subclasses. For example, if some \\nEMPLOYEE  entities do not belong to any of the subclasses {SECRETARY, ENGINEER, \\nTECHNICIAN}  in Figures 4.1 and 4.4, then that specialization is partial.7\\nNotice that the disjointness and completeness constraints are independent.  Hence, \\nwe have the following four possible constraints on a specialization:\\n ■Disjoint, total\\n ■Disjoint, partial\\n ■Overlapping, total\\n ■Overlapping, partial\\nOf course, the correct constraint is determined from the real-world meaning that \\napplies to each specialization. In general, a superclass that was identified through the generalization  process usually is total , because the superclass is derived from  the \\nsubclasses and hence contains only the entities that are in the subclasses.\\nCertain insertion and deletion rules apply to specialization (and generalization) as a \\nconsequence of the constraints specified earlier. Some of these rules are as follows:\\n ■Deleting an entity from a superclass implies that it is automatically deleted \\nfrom all the subclasses to which it belongs.\\n7The notation of using single or double lines is similar to that for partial or total participation of an entity \\ntype in a relationship type, as described in Chapter 3.Part_no Description\\nPART Manufacture_date\\nDrawing_no\\nPURCHASED_PARTSupplier_nameBatch_no\\nList_priceo\\nMANUFACTURED_PARTFigure 4.5 \\nEER diagram notation for an overlapping  (nondisjoint)  specialization.'),\n",

For example, in Figure 4.6 ENGINEER  is a subclass of \\nEMPLOYEE  and is also a superclass of ENGINEERING_MANAGER ; this represents the \\nreal-world constraint that every engineering manager is required to be an engineer. A specialization hierarchy  has the constraint that every subclass participates as a \\nsubclass  in only one  class/subclass relationship; that is, each subclass has only one \\nparent, which results in a tree structure  or strict hierarchy . In contrast, for a  \\nspecialization lattice , a subclass can be a subclass in more than one  class/subclass \\nrelationship. Hence, Figure 4.6 is a lattice.\\nFigure 4.7 shows another specialization lattice of more than one level. This may \\nbe part of a conceptual schema for a \\nUNIVERSITY  database. Notice that this \\narrangement would have been a hierarchy except for the STUDENT_ASSISTANT  \\nsubclass, which is a subclass in two distinct class/subclass relationships.\\nd\\nHOURL Y_E MPLOYEE\\nSALARIED_E MPLOYEE\\nENGINEERING_ MANAGERSECRETARY TECHNICIAN ENGINEER MANAGEREMPLOYEE\\ndFigure 4.6 \\nA specialization lattice with shared subclass ENGINEERING_MANAGER.'),\n",

Students are further classified as either graduate or undergraduate, with \\nthe specific attributes degree program (M.S., Ph.D., M.B.A., and so on) for graduate students and class (freshman, sophomore, and so on) for undergraduates.\\nIn Figure 4.7, all person entities represented in the database are members of \\nthe \\nPERSON  entity type, which is specialized into the subclasses {EMPLOYEE, \\nALUMNUS, STUDENT} . This specialization is overlapping; for example, an alum-\\nnus may also be an employee and a student pursuing an advanced degree. The subclass \\nSTUDENT  is the superclass for the specialization {GRADUATE_STUDENT, \\nUNDERGRADUATE_STUDENT} , whereas EMPLOYEE is the superclass for the \\nspecialization {STUDENT_ASSISTANT, FACULTY, STAFF} . Notice that  \\nSTUDENT_ASSISTANT  is also a subclass of STUDENT . Finally, STUDENT_ASSISTANT  \\nis the superclass for the specialization into {RESEARCH_ASSISTANT,  \\nTEACHING_ASSISTANT} .\\nIn such a specialization lattice or hierarchy, a subclass inherits the attributes not \\nonly of its direct superclass, but also of all its predecessor superclasses all the way to \\nthe root  of the hierarchy or lattice if necessary. For example, an entity in  \\nGRADUATE_STUDENT  inherits all the attributes of that entity as a STUDENT  and as a \\nPERSON . Notice that an entity may exist in several leaf nodes  of the hierarchy, \\nwhere a leaf node  is a class that has no subclasses of its own.  For example, a member \\nof GRADUATE_STUDENT  may also be a member of RESEARCH_ASSISTANT .\\nA subclass with more than one  superclass is called a shared subclass , such as \\nENGINEERING_MANAGER  in Figure 4.6. This leads to the concept known as \\nmultiple inheritance , where the shared subclass ENGINEERING_MANAGER  \\ndirectly inherits attributes and relationships from multiple superclasses. Notice \\nthat the existence of at least one shared subclass leads to a lattice (and hence to \\nmultiple inheritance ); if no shared subclasses existed, we would have a hierarchy \\nrather than a lattice and only single inheritance  would exist. An important rule \\nrelated to multiple inheritance can be illustrated by the example of the shared subclass \\nSTUDENT_ASSISTANT  in Figure 4.7, which inherits attributes from \\nboth EMPLOYEE  and STUDENT . Here, both EMPLOYEE  and STUDENT  inherit the \\nsame attributes  from PERSON . The rule states that if an attribute (or relation-\\nship) originating in the same superclass  (PERSON ) is inherited more than once \\nvia different paths ( EMPLOYEE  and STUDENT ) in the lattice, then it should be \\nincluded only once in the shared subclass ( STUDENT_ASSISTANT ). Hence, the \\nattributes of PERSON  are inherited only once  in the STUDENT_ASSISTANT  sub-\\nclass in Figure 4.7.\\nIt is important to note here that some models and languages are limited to single \\ninheritance  and do not allow  multiple inheritance (shared subclasses). It is also \\nimportant to note that some models do not allow an entity to have multiple \\ntypes, and hence an entity can be a member of only one leaf class.8 In such a \\nmodel, it is necessary to create additional subclasses as leaf nodes to cover all \\n8In some models, the class is further restricted to be a leaf node  in the hierarchy or lattice.'),\n",

For example, in the overlapping specialization of \\nPERSON  into {EMPLOYEE, ALUMNUS, STUDENT}  (or {E, A, S}  for short), it would \\nbe necessary to create seven subclasses of PERSON in order to cover all possible types of entities: \\nE, A, S, E_A, E_S, A_S,  and E_A_S . Obviously, this can lead to \\nextra complexity.\\nAlthough we have used specialization to illustrate our discussion, similar concepts \\napply equally  to generalization, as we mentioned at the beginning of this section. \\nHence, we can also speak of generalization hierarchies  and generalization lattices .\\n4.3.3  Utilizing Specialization and Generalization in  \\nRefining Conceptual Schemas\\nNow we elaborate on the differences between the specialization and generalization \\nprocesses and how they are used to refine conceptual schemas during conceptual database design. In the specialization process, the database designers typically start with an entity type and then define subclasses of the entity type by successive spe-cialization; that is, they repeatedly define more specific groupings of the entity type. For example, when designing the specialization lattice in Figure 4.7, we may first specify an entity type \\nPERSON  for a university database. Then we discover \\nthat three types of persons will be represented in the database: university employ-\\nees, alumni, and students and we create the specialization {EMPLOYEE, ALUMNUS, \\nSTUDENT} . The overlapping constraint is chosen because a person may belong  \\nto more than one of the subclasses. We specialize EMPLOYEE  further into  \\n{STAFF, FACULTY, STUDENT_ASSISTANT} , and specialize STUDENT  into  \\n{GRADUATE_ STUDENT, UNDERGRADUATE_STUDENT} . Finally, we specialize \\nSTUDENT_ASSISTANT  into {RESEARCH_ASSISTANT, TEACHING_ASSISTANT} . \\nThis process is called top-down conceptual refinement . So far, we have a hier-\\narchy; then we realize that STUDENT_ASSISTANT  is a shared subclass, since it is \\nalso a subclass of STUDENT , leading to the lattice.\\nIt is possible to arrive at the same hierarchy or lattice from the other direction. In \\nsuch a case, the process involves generalization rather than specialization and cor-responds to a bottom-up conceptual synthesis . For example, the database design-\\ners may first discover entity types such as \\nSTAFF , FACULTY , ALUMNUS , \\nGRADUATE_STUDENT , UNDERGRADUATE_STUDENT , RESEARCH_ASSISTANT , \\nTEACHING_ASSISTANT , and so on; then they generalize {GRADUATE_STUDENT, \\nUNDERGRADUATE_STUDENT}  into STUDENT ; then {RESEARCH_ASSISTANT, \\nTEACHING_ASSISTANT}  into STUDENT_ASSISTANT ; then {STAFF, FACULTY,  \\nSTUDENT_ASSISTANT}  into EMPLOYEE ; and finally {EMPLOYEE, ALUMNUS, STUDENT}  \\ninto PERSON .\\nThe final design of hierarchies or lattices resulting from either process may be \\nidentical; the only difference relates to the manner or order in which the schema superclasses and subclasses were created during the design process. In practice, it is likely that a combination of the two processes is employed. Notice that the'),\n",

For example, frame-based knowledge representation schemes closely resemble class hierarchies. Specialization is also common in software engineering design methodologies that are based on the object-oriented paradigm.\\n4.4  Modeling of U NION Types  \\nUsing Categories\\nIt is sometimes necessary to represent a collection of entities from different entity \\ntypes. In this case, a subclass will represent a collection of entities that is a subset of the \\nUNION  of entities from distinct entity types; we call such a subclass  a union type  \\nor a category .9\\nFor example, suppose that we have three entity types: PERSON , BANK , and  \\nCOMPANY . In a database for motor vehicle registration, an owner of a vehicle can \\nbe a person, a bank (holding a lien on a vehicle), or a company. We need to create a class (collection of entities) that includes entities of all three types to play the role of vehicle owner.  A category (union type) \\nOWNER  that is a subclass of the \\nUNION  of the three entity sets of COMPANY , BANK , and PERSON  can be created \\nfor this purpose. We display categories in an EER diagram as shown in Figure 4.8. The superclasses \\nCOMPANY , BANK , and PERSON  are connected to the circle with \\nthe ∪ symbol, which stands for the set union operation.  An arc with the subset \\nsymbol connects the circle to the (subclass) OWNER  category. In Figure 4.8 we \\nhave two categories: OWNER , which is a subclass (subset) of the union of PERSON , \\nBANK , and COMPANY ; and REGISTERED_VEHICLE , which is a subclass (subset) of \\nthe union of CAR  and TRUCK .\\nA category has two or more superclasses that may represent collections of enti-\\nties from distinct entity types,  whereas other superclass/subclass relationships \\nalways have a single superclass. To better understand the difference,  \\nwe can compare a category, such as OWNER  in Figure 4.8, with the  \\nENGINEERING_MANAGER  shared subclass in Figure 4.6. The latter is a subclass of \\neach of  the three superclasses ENGINEER , MANAGER , and SALARIED_EMPLOYEE , \\nso an entity that is a member of ENGINEERING_MANAGER  must exist in all \\nthree\\xa0collections.  This represents the constraint that an engineering manager must \\nbe an ENGINEER , a MANAGER , and a SALARIED_EMPLOYEE ; that is, the  \\nENGINEERING_MANAGER  entity set is a subset of the intersection  of the three \\nentity sets. On the other hand, a category is a subset of the union  of its super-\\nclasses. Hence, an entity that is a member of OWNER  must exist in only one  of the \\nsuperclasses. This represents the constraint that an OWNER  may be a COMPANY , \\na BANK , or a PERSON  in Figure 4.8.\\n9Our use of the term category  is based on the ECR (entity–category–relationship) model (Elmasri et al., \\n1985).'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 151}, page_content='4.4 Modeling of UNION Types Using Categories  121\\nAttribute inheritance works more selectively in the case of categories. For exam-\\nple, in Figure 4.8 each OWNER  entity inherits the attributes of a COMPANY , a \\nPERSON , or a BANK , depending on the superclass to which the entity belongs. On \\nthe other hand, a shared subclass such as ENGINEERING_MANAGER  (Figure 4.6) \\ninherits all the attributes of its superclasses SALARIED_EMPLOYEE , ENGINEER , \\nand MANAGER .\\nIt is interesting to note the difference between the category REGISTERED_VEHICLE  \\n(Figure 4.8) and the generalized superclass VEHICLE  (Figure 4.3(b)).

In general, \\na specialization or generalization such as that in Figure 4.3(b), if it were partial , \\nwould not preclude VEHICLE  from containing other types of entities, such as \\nmotorcycles. However, a category such as REGISTERED_VEHICLE  in Figure 4.8 \\nimplies that only cars and trucks, but not other types of entities, can be members of \\nREGISTERED_VEHICLE .\\nA category can be total  or partial . A total category holds the union  of all entities in \\nits superclasses, whereas a partial category can hold a subset of the union . A total \\ncategory is represented diagrammatically by a double line connecting the category and the circle, whereas a partial category is indicated by a single line.\\nThe superclasses of a category may have different key attributes, as demonstrated \\nby the \\nOWNER  category in Figure 4.8, or they may have the same key attribute, as \\ndemonstrated by the REGISTERED_VEHICLE  category. Notice that if a category is \\ntotal (not partial), it may be represented alternatively as a total specialization (or a total generalization). In this case, the choice of which representation to use is sub-jective. If the two classes represent the same type of entities and share numerous attributes, including the same key attributes, specialization/generalization is pre-ferred; otherwise, categorization (union type) is more appropriate.\\nIt is important to note that some modeling methodologies do not have union \\ntypes. In these models, a union type must be represented in a roundabout way \\n(see Section 9.2).\\n4.5  A Sample U NIVERSITY EER Schema,  \\nDesign Choices, and Formal Definitions\\nIn this section, we first give an example of a database schema in the EER model to \\nillustrate the use of the various concepts discussed here and in Chapter 3.

All fac-\\nulty members are related to the academic department(s) with which they are affiliated \\n[BELONGS]  (a faculty member can be associated with several departments, so the \\nrelationship is M:N). A specific attribute of STUDENT  is [Class]  (freshman = 1, sopho-\\nmore = 2, … , MS student = 5, PhD student = 6). Each STUDENT  is also related to his \\nor her major and minor departments (if known) [MAJOR]  and [MINOR] , to the course \\nsections he or she is currently attending [REGISTERED] , and to the courses completed \\n[TRANSCRIPT] . Each TRANSCRIPT  instance includes the grade the student received \\n[Grade]  in a section of a course.\\nGRAD_STUDENT  is a subclass of STUDENT , with the defining predicate ( Class  = 5 OR \\nClass  = 6). For each graduate student, we keep a list of previous degrees in a compos-\\nite, multivalued attribute [Degrees] . We also relate the graduate student to a faculty \\nadvisor [ADVISOR]  and to a thesis committee [COMMITTEE] , if one exists.\\nAn academic department has the attributes name [Dname] , telephone [Dphone] , and \\noffice number [Office]  and is related to the faculty member who is its chairperson \\n[CHAIRS]  and to the college to which it belongs [CD] . Each college has attributes col-\\nlege name [Cname] , office number [Coffice],  and the name of its dean [Dean] .\\nA course has attributes course number [C#] , course name [Cname] , and course \\ndescription [Cdesc] . Several sections of each course are offered, with each section \\nhaving the attributes section number [Sec#]  and the year and quarter in which the \\nsection was offered ( [Year]  and [Qtr] ).10 Section numbers uniquely identify each  \\nsection. The sections being offered during the current quarter are in a subclass  \\nCURRENT_SECTION  of SECTION , with the defining predicate Qtr = Current_qtr  and \\nYear = Current_year . Each section is related to the instructor who taught or is teach-\\ning it ( [TEACH] ), if that instructor is in the database.\\nThe category INSTRUCTOR_RESEARCHER  is a subset of the union of FACULTY  and \\nGRAD_STUDENT  and includes all faculty, as well as graduate students who are sup-\\nported by teaching or research. Finally, the entity type GRANT  keeps track of research \\ngrants and contracts awarded to the university. Each grant has attributes grant title \\n[Title] , grant number [No] , the awarding agency [Agency] , and the starting date \\n[St_date] . A grant is related to one principal investigator [PI] and to all researchers it \\nsupports [SUPPORT] . Each instance of support has as attributes the starting date of \\nsupport [Start] , the ending date of the support (if known) [End] , and the percentage of \\ntime being spent on the project [Time]  by the researcher being supported.\\n4.5.2 Design Choices for Specialization/Generalization\\nIt is not always easy to choose the most appropriate conceptual design for a database application.

In this section, we discuss design guidelines and choices for the EER concepts of specialization/generalization and categories (union types).\\nAs we mentioned in Section 3.7.3, conceptual database design should be considered \\nas an iterative refinement process until the most suitable design is reached. The fol-\\nlowing guidelines can help to guide the design process for EER concepts:\\n ■In general, many specializations and subclasses can be defined to make \\nthe conceptual model accurate. However, the drawback is that the design becomes quite cluttered. It is important to represent only those subclasses that are deemed necessary to avoid extreme cluttering of the conceptual schema.\\n ■If a subclass has few specific (local) attributes and no specific relationships, \\nit can be merged into the superclass. The specific attributes would hold NULL  \\nvalues for entities that are not members of the subclass. A type attribute \\ncould specify whether an entity is a member of the subclass.\\n ■Similarly, if all the subclasses of a specialization/generalization have few spe-\\ncific attributes and no specific relationships, they can be merged into the \\nsuperclass and replaced with one or more type attributes that specify the \\nsubclass or subclasses that each entity belongs to (see Section 9.2 for how \\nthis criterion applies to relational databases).\\n ■Union types and categories should generally be avoided unless the situation \\ndefinitely warrants this type of construct, which does occur in some practi-\\ncal situations. If possible, we try to model using specialization/generaliza-\\ntion as discussed at the end of Section 4.4.\\n ■The choice of disjoint/overlapping and total/partial constraints on special-\\nization/generalization is driven by the rules in the miniworld being mod-\\neled. If the requirements do not indicate any particular constraints, the \\ndefault would generally be overlapping and partial, since this does not spec-ify any restrictions on subclass membership.\\nAs an example of applying these guidelines, consider Figure 4.6, where no specific \\n(local) attributes are shown. We could merge all the subclasses into the \\nEMPLOYEE  \\nentity type and add the following attributes to EMPLOYEE :\\n ■An attribute Job_type  whose value set {‘Secretary’, ‘Engineer’, ‘Technician’} \\nwould indicate which subclass in the first specialization each employee \\nbelongs to.\\n ■An attribute Pay_method  whose value set {‘Salaried’, ‘Hourly’} would \\nindicate which subclass in the second specialization each employee \\nbelongs to.'),\n",

A class11 \\ndefines a type of entity and represents a set or collection of entities of that type; this \\nincludes any of the EER schema constructs that correspond to collections of enti-ties, such as entity types, subclasses, superclasses, and categories. A subclass  S is a \\nclass whose entities must always be a subset of the entities in another class, called the superclass  C of the superclass/subclass  (or IS-A ) relationship . We denote \\nsuch a relationship by C/S. For such a superclass/subclass relationship, we must \\nalways have\\nS ⊆ C\\nA specialization  Z = {S\\n1, S2, … , Sn} is a set of subclasses that have the same super-\\nclass G; that is, G/Si is a superclass/subclass relationship for i = 1, 2, … , n. G is called \\na generalized entity type  (or the superclass  of the specialization, or a generalization  \\nof the subclasses { S1, S2, … , Sn} ). Z is said to be total  if we always (at any point in \\ntime) have\\n∪n\\ni=1 Si = G\\nOtherwise, Z is said to be partial . Z is said to be disjoint  if we always have\\nSi ∩ Sj = ∅ (empty set) for i ≠ j\\nOtherwise, Z is said to be overlapping .\\nA subclass S of C is said to be predicate-defined  if a predicate p on the attributes of \\nC is used to specify which entities in C are members of S; that is, S = C[p], where \\nC[p] is the set of entities in C that satisfy p. A subclass that is not defined by a \\npredicate is called user-defined .\\nA specialization Z (or generalization G) is said to be attribute-defined  if a \\npredicate ( A = ci), where A is an attribute of G and ci is a constant value from \\nthe domain of A, is used to specify membership in each subclass Si in Z. Notice \\nthat if ci ≠ cj for i ≠ j, and A is a single-valued attribute, then the specialization \\nwill be disjoint.\\nA category  T is a class that is a subset of the union of n defining superclasses D1, D2, \\n… , Dn, n > 1 and is formally specified as follows:\\nT ⊆ (D1 ∪ D2 ...  ∪ Dn)\\n11The use of the word class  here refers to a collection (set) of entities, which differs from its more  \\ncommon use in object-oriented programming languages such as C++. In C++, a class is a structured type definition along with its applicable functions (operations).'),\n",

If a predicate is specified on every Di, we get\\nT = (D1[p1] ∪ D2[p2] ... ∪ Dn[pn])\\nWe should now extend the definition of relationship type  given in Chapter 3 by \\nallowing any class—not only any entity type—to participate in a relationship. Hence, we should replace the words entity type  with class  in that definition. The \\ngraphical notation of EER is consistent with ER because all classes are represented by rectangles.\\n4.6  Example of Other Notation: Representing \\nSpecialization and Generalization in U ML \\nClass Diagrams\\nWe now discuss the UML notation for generalization/specialization and inheri-\\ntance. We already presented basic UML class diagram notation and terminology in Section 3.8. Figure 4.10 illustrates a possible UML class diagram corresponding to the EER diagram in Figure 4.7. The basic notation for specialization/generaliza-tion (see Figure 4.10) is to connect the subclasses by vertical lines to a horizontal line, which has a triangle connecting the horizontal line through another vertical line to the superclass. A blank triangle indicates a specialization/generalization with the disjoint  constraint, and a filled triangle indicates an overlapping  con-\\nstraint. The root superclass is called the base class , and the subclasses (leaf nodes) \\nare called leaf classes .\\nThe preceding discussion and the example in Figure 4.10, as well as the presenta-\\ntion in Section 3.8, gave a brief overview of UML class diagrams and terminology. We focused on the concepts that are relevant to ER and EER database modeling rather than on those concepts that are more relevant to software engineering. In UML, there are many details that we have not discussed because they are outside the scope of this text and are mainly relevant to software engineering. For example, classes can be of various types:\\n ■Abstract classes define attributes and operations but do not have objects \\ncorresponding to those classes. These are mainly used to specify a set of attributes and operations that can be inherited.\\n ■Concrete classes can have objects (entities) instantiated to belong to the \\nclass.\\n ■Template classes specify a template that can be further used to define \\nother classes.\\nIn database design, we are mainly concerned with specifying concrete classes whose \\ncollections of objects are permanently (or persistently) stored in the database. The bibliographic notes at the end of this chapter give some references to books that describe complete details of UML.'),\n",

This terminology is not only used in conceptual'),\n",

This section discusses the similarities and differ-\\nences between conceptual modeling and knowledge representation, and introduces some of the alternative terminology and a few additional concepts.\\nThe goal of KR techniques is to develop concepts for accurately modeling some domain \\nof knowledge  by creating an ontology\\n12 that describes the concepts of the domain \\nand how these concepts are interrelated. The ontology is used to store and manipu-late knowledge for drawing inferences, making decisions, or answering questions. The goals of KR are similar to those of semantic data models, but there are some important similarities and differences between the two disciplines:\\n ■Both disciplines use an abstraction process to identify common properties and \\nimportant aspects of objects in the miniworld (also known as domain of discourse  \\nin KR) while suppressing insignificant differences and unimportant details.\\n ■Both disciplines provide concepts, relationships, constraints, operations, \\nand languages for defining data and representing knowledge.\\n ■KR is generally broader in scope than semantic data models. Different forms \\nof knowledge, such as rules (used in inference, deduction, and search), \\nincomplete and default knowledge, and temporal and spatial knowledge, are \\nrepresented in KR schemes. Database models are being expanded to include \\nsome of these concepts (see Chapter 26).\\n ■KR schemes include reasoning mechanisms  that deduce additional facts \\nfrom the facts stored in a database. Hence, whereas most current database \\nsystems are limited to answering direct queries, knowledge-based systems \\nusing KR schemes can answer queries that involve inferences  over the \\nstored data. Database technology is being extended with inference mecha-nisms (see Section 26.5).\\n ■Whereas most data models concentrate on the representation of database \\nschemas, or meta-knowledge, KR schemes often mix up the schemas with \\nthe instances themselves in order to provide flexibility in representing \\nexceptions. This often results in inefficiencies when these KR schemes are implemented, especially when compared with databases and when a large amount of structured data (facts) needs to be stored.\\nWe now discuss four abstraction concepts  that are used in semantic data models, \\nsuch as the EER model, as well as in KR schemes: (1) classification and instantia-tion, (2) identification, (3) specialization and generalization, and (4) aggregation and association. The paired concepts of classification and instantiation are inverses of one another, as are generalization and specialization. The concepts of aggrega-tion and association are also related. We discuss these abstract concepts and their relation to the concrete representations used in the EER model to clarify the data abstraction process and to improve our understanding of the related process of conceptual schema design. We close the section with a brief discussion of ontology , \\nwhich is being used widely in recent knowledge representation research.\\n12An ontology  is somewhat similar to a conceptual schema, but with more knowledge, rules, and exceptions.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 160}, page_content='130 Chapter 4 The Enhanced Entity–Relationship (EER) Model\\n4.7.1 Classification and Instantiation\\nThe process of classification  involves systematically assigning similar objects/enti-\\nties to object classes/entity types. We can now describe (in DB) or reason about (in KR) the classes rather than the individual objects. Collections of objects that share the same types of attributes, relationships, and constraints are classified into classes in order to simplify the process of discovering their properties. Instantiation  is the \\ninverse of classification and refers to the generation and specific examination of distinct objects of a class. An object instance is related to its object class by the  IS-AN-INSTANCE-OF  or IS-A-MEMBER-OF  relationship. Although EER dia-\\ngrams do not display instances, the UML diagrams allow a form of instantiation by permitting the display of individual objects. We did not  describe this feature in our \\nintroduction to UML class diagrams.\\nIn general, the objects of a class should have a similar type structure. However, \\nsome objects may display properties that differ in some respects from the other objects of the class; these exception objects  also need to be modeled, and KR \\nschemes allow more varied exceptions than do database models. In addition, cer-tain properties apply to the class as a whole and not to the individual objects; KR schemes allow such class properties . UML diagrams also allow specification of \\nclass properties.\\nIn the EER model, entities are classified into entity types according to their basic \\nattributes and relationships. Entities are further classified into subclasses and cat-\\negories based on additional similarities and differences (exceptions) among them. Relationship instances are classified into relationship types. Hence, entity types, subclasses, categories, and relationship types are the different concepts that are used for classification in the EER model. The EER model does not provide explicitly for class properties, but it may be extended to do so. In UML, objects are classified into classes, and it is possible to display both class properties and individual objects.\\nKnowledge representation models allow multiple classification schemes in \\nwhich one class is an instance  of another class (called a meta-class ). Notice that \\nthis cannot  be represented directly in the EER model, because we have only two \\nlevels—classes and instances. The only relationship among classes in the EER model is a superclass/subclass relationship, whereas in some KR schemes an additional class/instance relationship can be represented directly in a class hierarchy. An instance may itself be another class, allowing multiple-level classification schemes.\\n4.7.2 Identification\\nIdentification  is the abstraction process whereby classes and objects are made \\nuniquely identifiable by means of some identifier . For example, a class name uniquely \\nidentifies a whole class within a schema. An additional mechanism is necessary for telling distinct object instances apart by means of object identifiers. Moreover, it is necessary to identify multiple manifestations in the database of the same real-world'),\n",

For example, we may have a tuple <‘Matthew Clarke’, ‘610618’, ‘376-9821’> in \\na PERSON  relation and another tuple <‘301-54-0836’, ‘CS’, 3.8> in a STUDENT  rela-\\ntion that happen to represent the same real-world entity. There is no way to identify the fact that these two database objects (tuples) represent the same real-world entity unless we make a provision at design time  for appropriate cross-referencing to \\nsupply this identification. Hence, identification is needed at two levels:\\n ■To distinguish among database objects and classes\\n ■To identify database objects and to relate them to their real-world counterparts\\nIn the EER model, identification of schema constructs is based on a system of \\nunique names for the constructs in a schema. For example, every class in an EER schema—whether it is an entity type, a subclass, a category, or a relationship type—must have a distinct name. The names of attributes of a particular class must also be distinct. Rules for unambiguously identifying attribute name references in a spe-cialization or generalization lattice or hierarchy are needed as well.\\nAt the object level, the values of key attributes are used to distinguish among enti-\\nties of a particular entity type. For weak entity types, entities are identified by a \\ncombination of their own partial key values and the entities they are related to in \\nthe owner entity type(s). Relationship instances are identified by some combination \\nof the entities that they relate to, depending on the cardinality ratio specified.\\n4.7.3 Specialization and Generalization\\nSpecialization  is the process of classifying a class of objects into more specialized \\nsubclasses. Generalization  is the inverse process of generalizing several classes into \\na higher-level abstract class that includes the objects in all these classes. Specializa-tion is conceptual refinement, whereas generalization is conceptual synthesis. Sub-classes are used in the EER model to represent specialization and generalization. We call the relationship between a subclass and its superclass an IS-A-SUBCLASS-OF  \\nrelationship, or simply an IS-A  relationship. This is the same as the IS-A relation-\\nship discussed earlier in Section 4.5.3.\\n4.7.4 Aggregation and Association\\nAggregation  is an abstraction concept for building composite objects from their \\ncomponent objects. There are three cases where this concept can be related to the EER model. The first case is the situation in which we aggregate attribute values of an object to form the whole object. The second case is when we represent an aggre-gation relationship as an ordinary relationship. The third case, which the EER model does not provide for explicitly, involves the possibility of combining objects that are related by a particular relationship instance into a higher-level aggregate \\nobject.  This is sometimes useful when the higher-level aggregate object is itself to be \\nrelated to another object. We call the relationship between the primitive objects and their aggregate object IS-A-PART-OF ; the inverse is called IS-A-COMPONENT-OF . \\nUML provides for all three types of aggregation.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 162}, page_content='132 Chapter 4 The Enhanced Entity–Relationship (EER) Model\\nThe abstraction of association  is used to associate objects from several independent \\nclasses.  Hence, it is somewhat similar to the second use of aggregation. It is repre-\\nsented in the EER model by relationship types, and in UML by associations. This abstract relationship is called IS-ASSOCIATED-WITH .\\nIn order to understand the different uses of aggregation better, consider the ER \\nschema shown in Figure 4.11(a), which stores information about interviews by \\njob applicants to various companies. The class \\nCOMPANY  is an aggregation of \\nthe attributes (or component objects) Cname  (company name) and Caddress  \\n(company address), whereas JOB_APPLICANT  is an aggregate of Ssn, Name , \\nAddress , and Phone . The relationship attributes Contact_name  and Contact_phone  \\nrepresent the name and phone number of the person in the company who is responsible for the interview. Suppose that some interviews result in job offers, whereas others do not. We would like to treat \\nINTERVIEW  as a class to associate it \\nwith JOB_OFFER . The schema shown in Figure 4.11(b) is incorrect  because it \\nrequires each interview relationship instance to have a job offer. The schema shown in Figure 4.11(c) is not allowed  because the ER model does not allow rela-\\ntionships among relationships.\\nOne way to represent this situation is to create a higher-level aggregate class com-\\nposed of \\nCOMPANY , JOB_APPLICANT , and INTERVIEW  and to relate this class to \\nJOB_OFFER , as shown in Figure 4.11(d). Although the EER model as described in \\nthis book does not have this facility, some semantic data models do allow it and call \\nthe resulting object a composite  or molecular object . Other models treat entity \\ntypes and relationship types uniformly and hence permit relationships among rela-\\ntionships, as illustrated in Figure 4.11(c).\\nTo represent this situation correctly in the ER model as described here, we need to \\ncreate a new weak entity type INTERVIEW , as shown in Figure 4.11(e), and relate it to \\nJOB_OFFER . Hence, we can always represent these situations correctly in the ER \\nmodel by creating additional entity types, although it may be conceptually more \\ndesirable to allow direct representation of aggregation, as in Figure 4.11(d), or to \\nallow relationships among relationships, as in Figure 4.11(c).\\nThe main structural distinction between aggregation and association is that when \\nan association instance is deleted, the participating objects may continue to exist. \\nHowever, if we support the notion of an aggregate object—for example, a CAR  that \\nis made up of objects ENGINE , CHASSIS , and TIRES —then deleting the aggregate \\nCAR  object amounts to deleting all its component objects.\\n4.7.5 Ontologies and the Semantic Web\\nIn recent years, the amount of computerized data and information available on the Web has spiraled out of control. Many different models and formats are used. \\nIn addition to the database models that we present in this text, much information is stored in the form of documents , which have considerably less structure than'),\n",

One ongoing project that is attempting to allow \\ninformation exchange among computers on the Web is called the Semantic \\nWeb , which attempts to create knowledge representation models that are quite \\ngeneral in order to allow meaningful information exchange and search among machines. The concept of ontology  is considered to be the most promising basis \\nfor achieving the goals of the Semantic Web and is closely related to knowledge representation. In this section, we give a brief introduction to what ontology is and how it can be used as a basis to automate information understanding, search, and exchange.\\nThe study of ontologies attempts to describe the concepts and relationships that are \\npossible in reality through some common vocabulary; therefore, it can be consid-ered as a way to describe the knowledge of a certain community about reality. Ontology originated in the fields of philosophy and metaphysics. One commonly used definition of ontology  is a specification  of a conceptualization .\\n13\\nIn this definition, a conceptualization  is the set of concepts and relationships that \\nare used to represent the part of reality or knowledge that is of interest to a com-\\nmunity of users. Specification  refers to the language and vocabulary terms that are \\nused to specify the conceptualization. The ontology includes both specification  and \\nconceptualization.  For example, the same conceptualization may be specified in two \\ndifferent languages, giving two separate ontologies. Based on this general defini-tion, there is no consensus on what an ontology is exactly. Some possible ways to describe ontologies are as follows:\\n ■A thesaurus  (or even a dictionary  or a glossary  of terms) describes the rela-\\ntionships between words (vocabulary) that represent various concepts.\\n ■A taxonomy  describes how concepts of a particular area of knowledge \\nare related using structures similar to those used in a specialization or \\ngeneralization.\\n ■A detailed database schema  is considered by some to be an ontology that \\ndescribes the concepts (entities and attributes) and relationships of a mini-world from reality.\\n ■A logical theory  uses concepts from mathematical logic to try to define con-\\ncepts and their interrelationships.\\nUsually the concepts used to describe ontologies are similar to the concepts we dis-\\ncuss in conceptual modeling, such as entities, attributes, relationships, specializa-\\ntions, and so on. The main difference between an ontology and, say, a database \\nschema, is that the schema is usually limited to describing a small subset of a mini-\\nworld from reality in order to store and manage data. An ontology is usually con-\\nsidered to be more general in that it attempts to describe a part of reality or a domain of interest (for example, medical terms, electronic-commerce applications, sports, and so on) as completely as possible.\\n13This definition is given in Gruber (1995).'),\n",

About 10% of the volumes are out on loan at any one time. The librar-\\nians ensure that the books that members want to borrow are available when the members want to borrow them. Also, the librarians must know how many copies of each book are in the library or out on loan at any given time. A catalog of books is available online that lists books by author, title, and subject area. For each title in the library, a book description is kept in the catalog; the description ranges from one sentence to several pages. The refer-ence librarians want to be able to access this description when members request information about a book. Library staff includes chief librarian, departmental associate librarians, reference librarians, check-out staff, and library assistants.\\nBooks can be checked out for 21 days. Members are allowed to have only \\nfive books out at a time. Members usually return books within three to four weeks. Most members know that they have one week of grace before a notice is sent to them, so they try to return books before the grace period ends. About 5% of the members have to be sent reminders to return books. Most overdue books are returned within a month of the due date. Approxi-mately 5% of the overdue books are either kept or never returned. The most active members of the library are defined as those who borrow books at least ten times during the year. The top 1% of membership does 15% of the borrowing, and the top 10% of the membership does 40% of the borrowing. About 20% of the members are totally inactive in that they are members who never borrow.\\nTo become a member of the library, applicants fill out a form including their \\nSSN, campus and home mailing addresses, and phone numbers.

A month before a card expires, a notice is sent to a member for renewal. Professors at the institute are considered auto-matic members. When a new faculty member joins the institute, his or her information is pulled from the employee records and a library card is mailed to his or her campus address. Professors are allowed to check out books for three-month intervals and have a two-week grace period. Renewal notices to professors are sent to their campus address.\\nThe library does not lend some books, such as reference books, rare books, \\nand maps. The librarians must differentiate between books that can be lent and those that cannot be lent. In addition, the librarians have a list of some books they are interested in acquiring but cannot obtain, such as rare or out-of-print books and books that were lost or destroyed but have not been replaced. The librarians must have a system that keeps track of books that cannot be lent as well as books that they are interested in acquiring. Some books may have the same title; therefore, the title cannot be used as a means of identification. Every book is identified by its International Standard Book Number (ISBN), a unique international code assigned to all books. Two books with the same title can have different ISBNs if they are in different languages or have different bindings (hardcover or softcover). Editions of the same book have different ISBNs.\\nThe proposed database system must be designed to keep track of the mem-\\nbers, the books, the catalog, and the borrowing activity.\\n 4.20.

Figure 4.12 shows an example of an EER diagram for a small-private-airport database; the database is used to keep track of airplanes, their owners, air-\\nport employees, and pilots. From the requirements for this database, the fol-\\nlowing information was collected: Each \\nAIRPLANE  has a registration number \\n[Reg#] , is of a particular plane type [OF_TYPE] , and is stored in a particular \\nhangar [STORED_IN] . Each PLANE_TYPE  has a model number [Model] , a \\ncapacity [Capacity] , and a weight [Weight] . Each HANGAR  has a number  \\n[Number] , a capacity [Capacity] , and a location [Location] . The database also \\nkeeps track of the OWNERs  of each plane [OWNS]  and the EMPLOYEEs  who \\nhave maintained the plane [MAINTAIN] . Each relationship instance in OWNS  \\nrelates an AIRPLANE  to an OWNER  and includes the purchase date [Pdate] . \\nEach relationship instance in MAINTAIN  relates an EMPLOYEE  to a service \\nrecord [SERVICE] . Each plane undergoes service many times; hence, it is \\nrelated by [PLANE_SERVICE]  to a number of SERVICE  records. A SERVICE  \\nrecord includes as attributes the date of maintenance [Date] , the number of \\nhours spent on the work [Hours] , and the type of work done [Work_code] .

An OWNER  \\nis either a person or a corporation. Hence, we use a union type (category) \\n[OWNER]  that is a subset of the union of corporation [CORPORATION]  and \\nperson [PERSON]  entity types. Both pilots [PILOT]  and employees \\n[EMPLOYEE]  are subclasses of PERSON . Each PILOT  has specific attributes \\nlicense number [Lic_num]  and restrictions [Restr] ; each EMPLOYEE  has spe-\\ncific attributes salary [Salary]  and shift worked [Shift] .

We give a repre-sentative list here. One group of papers, including Abrial (1974), Senko’s DIAM model (1975), the NIAM method (Verheijen and VanBekkum 1982), and Bracchi et al. (1976), presents semantic models that are based on the concept of binary rela-tionships. Another group of early papers discusses methods for extending the rela-tional model to enhance its modeling capabilities. This includes the papers by Schmid and Swenson (1975), Navathe and Schkolnick (1978), Codd’s RM/T model (1979), Furtado (1978), and the structural model of Wiederhold and Elmasri (1979).\\nThe ER model was proposed originally by Chen (1976) and is formalized in Ng \\n(1981). Since then, numerous extensions of its modeling capabilities have been pro-posed, as in Scheuermann et al. (1979), Dos Santos et al. (1979), Teorey et al. (1986), Gogolla and Hohenstein (1991), and the entity–category–relationship (ECR) model of Elmasri et al. (1985). Smith and Smith (1977) present the concepts of generaliza-tion and aggregation. The semantic data model of Hammer and McLeod (1981) introduces the concepts of class/subclass lattices, as well as other advanced model-ing concepts.\\nA survey of semantic data modeling appears in Hull and King (1987).

The relational data model was \\nfirst introduced by Ted Codd of IBM Research in 1970 in a classic paper (Codd, 1970), and it attracted immediate attention due to its simplicity and mathematical foundation. The model uses the concept of a mathematical relation— which looks \\nsomewhat like a table of values—as its basic building block, and has its theoretical basis in set theory and first-order predicate logic. In this chapter we discuss the basic characteristics of the model and its constraints.\\nThe first commercial implementations of the relational model became available in \\nthe early 1980s, such as the SQL/DS system on the MVS operating system by IBM and the Oracle DBMS. Since then, the model has been implemented in a large num-ber of commercial systems, as well as a number of open source systems. Current popular commercial relational DBMSs (RDBMSs) include DB2 (from IBM), Oracle (from Oracle), Sybase DBMS (now from SAP), and SQLServer and Microsoft Access (from Microsoft). In addition, several open source systems, such as MySQL and PostgreSQL, are available.\\nBecause of the importance of the relational model, all of Part 2 is devoted to this \\nmodel and some of the languages associated with it. In Chapters 6 and 7, we describe some aspects of SQL, which is a comprehensive model and language that is the standard  for commercial relational DBMSs. (Additional aspects of SQL will be cov-\\nered in other chapters.) Chapter 8 covers the operations of the relational algebra and introduces the relational calculus—these are two formal languages associated with the relational model. The relational calculus is considered to be the basis for the \\nSQL language, and the relational algebra is used in the internals of many database implementations for query processing and optimization (see Part 8 of the book).chapter 5'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 180}, page_content='150 Chapter 5 The Relational Data Model and Relational Database Constraints\\nOther features of the relational model are presented in subsequent parts of the \\nbook. Chapter 9 relates the relational model data structures to the constructs of the ER and EER models (presented in Chapters 3 and 4), and presents algorithms for designing a relational database schema by mapping a conceptual schema in the ER or EER model into a relational representation. These mappings are incorporated into many database design and CASE\\n1 tools. Chapters 10 and 11 in Part 4 discuss \\nthe programming techniques used to access database systems and the notion of connecting to relational databases via ODBC and JDBC standard protocols. We also introduce the topic of Web database programming in Chapter 11. Chapters 14 and 15 in Part 6 present another aspect of the relational model, namely the formal constraints of functional and multivalued dependencies; these dependencies are used to develop a relational database design theory based on the concept known as normalization.\\nIn this chapter, we concentrate on describing the basic principles of the relational \\nmodel of data. We begin by defining the modeling concepts and notation of the relational model in Section 5.1. Section 5.2 is devoted to a discussion of relational constraints that are considered an important part of the relational model and are automatically enforced in most relational DBMSs. Section 5.3 defines the update operations of the relational model, discusses how violations of integrity constraints are handled, and introduces the concept of a transaction. Section 5.4 summarizes the chapter.\\nThis chapter and Chapter 8 focus on the formal foundations of the relational model, \\nwhereas Chapters 6 and 7 focus on the SQL practical relational model, which is the \\nbasis of most commercial and open source relational DBMSs. Many concepts are \\ncommon between the formal and practical models, but a few differences exist that we shall point out.\\n5.1 Relational Model Concepts\\nThe relational model represents the database as a collection of relations.  Informally, \\neach relation resembles a table of values or, to some extent, a flat file of records. It is \\ncalled a flat file  because each record has a simple linear or flat structure. For exam-\\nple, the database of files that was shown in Figure 1.2 is similar to the basic rela-tional model representation. However, there are important differences between relations and files, as we shall soon see.\\nWhen a relation is thought of as a table  of values, each row in the table represents a \\ncollection of related data values. A row represents a fact that typically corresponds to a real-world entity or relationship. The table name and column names are used to help to interpret the meaning of the values in each row. For example, the first table of Figure 1.2 is called \\nSTUDENT  because each row represents facts \\nabout a particular student entity. The column names— Name , Student_number , \\n1CASE stands for computer-aided software engineering.'),\n",

All values in a column are of the same data type.\\nIn the formal relational model terminology, a row is called a tuple,  a column \\nheader is called an attribute,  and the table is called a relation.  The data type \\ndescribing the types of values that can appear in each column is represented by a domain  of possible values. We now define these terms— domain, tuple, attribute,  \\nand relation— formally.\\n5.1.1 Domains, Attributes, Tuples, and Relations\\nA domain  D is a set of atomic values. By atomic  we mean that each value in the \\ndomain is indivisible as far as the formal relational model is concerned. A common method of specifying a domain is to specify a data type from which the data values forming the domain are drawn. It is also useful to specify a name for the domain, to help in interpreting its values. Some examples of domains follow:\\n ■Usa_phone_numbers . The set of ten-digit phone numbers valid in the United \\nStates.\\n ■Local_phone_numbers . The set of seven-digit phone numbers valid within a \\nparticular area code in the United States. The use of local phone numbers is quickly becoming obsolete, being replaced by standard ten-digit numbers.\\n ■Social_security_numbers . The set of valid nine-digit Social Security numbers. \\n(This is a unique identifier assigned to each person in the United States for employment, tax, and benefits purposes.)\\n ■Names : The set of character strings that represent names of persons.\\n ■Grade_point_averages . Possible values of computed grade point averages; \\neach must be a real (floating-point) number between 0 and 4.\\n ■Employee_ages . Possible ages of employees in a company; each must be an \\ninteger value between 15 and 80.\\n ■Academic_department_names . The set of academic department names in a \\nuniversity, such as Computer Science, Economics, and Physics.\\n ■Academic_department_codes . The set of academic department codes, such as \\n‘CS’, ‘ECON’, and ‘PHYS’.\\nThe preceding are called logical  definitions of domains. A data type  or format  is \\nalso specified for each domain. For example, the data type for the domain  \\nUsa_phone_numbers  can be declared as a character string of the form ( ddd)ddd-dddd , \\nwhere each d is a numeric (decimal) digit and the first three digits form a valid  \\ntelephone area code. The data type for Employee_ages  is an integer number between \\n15 and 80. For Academic_department_names , the data type is the set of all character \\nstrings that represent valid department names. A domain is thus given a name, data type, and format. Additional information for interpreting the values of a domain can also be given; for example, a numeric domain such as \\nPerson_weights  should \\nhave the units of measurement, such as pounds or kilograms.'),\n",

A relation schema is used to describe  a relation; R is \\ncalled the name  of this relation. The degree  (or arity ) of a relation is the number of \\nattributes n of its relation schema.\\nA relation of degree seven, which stores information about university students, \\nwould contain seven attributes describing each student as follows:\\nSTUDENT(Name, Ssn, Home_phone, Address, Office_phone, Age, Gpa)\\nUsing the data type of each attribute, the definition is sometimes written as:\\nSTUDENT(Name: string , Ssn: string , Home_phone: string , Address: string , \\nOffice_phone: string , Age: integer , Gpa: real)\\nFor this relation schema, STUDENT  is the name of the relation, which has seven \\nattributes. In the preceding definition, we showed assignment of generic types such \\nas string or integer to the attributes.

The terms relation intension  for the \\nschema R and relation extension  for a relation state r(R) are also commonly used.\\nFigure 5.1 shows an example of a STUDENT  relation, which corresponds to the \\nSTUDENT  schema just specified. Each tuple in the relation represents a particular \\nstudent entity (or object).

A relation (or relation state) r(R) is a mathematical relation  of \\ndegree n on the domains dom( A1), dom( A2), … , dom( An), which is a subset  of the \\nCartesian product  (denoted by ×) of the domains that define R:\\nr(R) ⊆ (dom( A1) × dom( A2) × . . . × (dom( An))\\nThe Cartesian product specifies all possible combinations of values from the under-\\nlying domains. Hence, if we denote the total number of values, or cardinality,  in a \\ndomain D by | D| (assuming that all domains are finite), the total number of tuples \\nin the Cartesian product is\\n|dom( A1)| × |dom( A2)| × . . . × |dom( An)|\\nThis product of cardinalities of all domains represents the total number of possible \\ninstances or tuples that can ever exist in any relation state r(R). Of all these possible \\ncombinations, a relation state at a given time—the current relation state —reflects \\nonly the valid tuples that represent a particular state of the real world. In general, as the state of the real world changes, so does the relation state, by being transformed into another relation state. However, the schema R is relatively static and changes \\nvery infrequently—for example, as a result of adding an attribute to represent new \\ninformation that was not originally stored in the relation.\\nIt is possible for several attributes to have the same domain.  The attribute names indi-\\ncate different roles , or interpretations, for the domain. For example, in the \\nSTUDENT  \\nrelation, the same domain USA_phone_numbers  plays the role of Home_phone , referring \\nto the home phone of a student , and the role of Office_phone , referring to the office \\nphone of the student . A third possible attribute (not shown) with the same domain \\ncould be Mobile_phone .\\n5.1.2 Characteristics of Relations\\nThe earlier definition of relations implies certain characteristics that make a rela-tion different from a file or a table.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 184}, page_content='154 Chapter 5 The Relational Data Model and Relational Database Constraints\\nOrdering of Tuples in a Relation. A relation is defined as a set of tuples. Math-\\nematically, elements of a set have no order  among them; hence, tuples in a relation \\ndo not have any particular order. In other words, a relation is not sensitive to the ordering of tuples. However, in a file, records are physically stored on disk (or in memory), so there always is an order among the records. This ordering indicates first, second, ith, and last records in the file. Similarly, when we display a relation as \\na table, the rows are displayed in a certain order.\\nTuple ordering is not part of a relation definition because a relation attempts to rep-\\nresent facts at a logical or abstract level. Many tuple orders can be specified on the same relation. For example, tuples in the \\nSTUDENT  relation in Figure 5.1 could be \\nordered by values of Name , Ssn, Age, or some other attribute. The definition of a rela-\\ntion does not specify any order: There is no preference  for one ordering over another. \\nHence, the relation displayed in Figure 5.2 is considered identical  to the one shown in \\nFigure 5.1. When a relation is implemented as a file or displayed as a table, a particular ordering may be specified on the records of the file or the rows of the table.\\nOrdering of Values within a Tuple and an Alternative Definition of a Relation.  \\nAccording to the preceding definition of a relation, an n-tuple is an ordered list  of n \\nvalues, so the ordering of values in a tuple—and hence of attributes in a relation schema—is important. However, at a more abstract level, the order of attributes and their values is not that important as long as the correspondence between attri-\\nbutes and values is maintained.\\nAn alternative definition  of a relation can be given, making the ordering of values \\nin a tuple unnecessary.  In this definition, a relation schema R = {A\\n1, A2, … , An} is a \\nset of attributes (instead of an ordered list of attributes), and a relation state r(R) is \\na finite set of mappings r = {t1, t2, … , tm}, where each tuple ti is a mapping  from R \\nto D, and D is the union  (denoted by ∪) of the attribute domains; that is, D = \\ndom( A1) ∪ dom( A2) ∪ … ∪ dom( An). In this definition, t[Ai] must be in dom( Ai) \\nfor 1 ≤ i ≤ n for each mapping t in r. Each mapping ti is called a tuple.\\nAccording to this definition of tuple as a mapping, a tuple  can be considered as a \\nset of (<attribute>, <value>) pairs, where each pair gives the value of the mapping \\nfrom an attribute Ai to a value vi from dom( Ai). The ordering of attributes is not \\nimportant, because the attribute name  appears with its value .

This makes sense at an abstract level, \\nsince there really is no reason to prefer having one attribute value appear before another in a tuple. When the attribute name and value are included together in a tuple, it is known as self-describing data , because the description of each value \\n(attribute name) is included in the tuple.\\nWe will mostly use the first definition  of relation, where the attributes are ordered  \\nin the relation schema and the values within tuples are similarly ordered,  because it \\nsimplifies much of the notation. However, the alternative definition given here is more general.\\n5\\nValues and NULLs in the Tuples. Each value in a tuple is an atomic  value; that \\nis, it is not divisible into components within the framework of the basic relational \\nmodel. Hence, composite and multivalued attributes (see Chapter 3) are not \\nallowed. This model is sometimes called the flat relational model . Much of the \\ntheory behind the relational model was developed with this assumption in mind, which is called the first normal form  assumption.\\n6 Hence, multivalued attributes \\nmust be represented by separate relations, and composite attributes are represented \\nonly by their simple component attributes in the basic relational model.7\\nAn important concept is that of NULL  values, which are used to represent the values of \\nattributes that may be unknown or may not apply to a tuple. A special value, called \\nNULL , is used in these cases. For example, in Figure 5.1, some STUDENT  tuples have \\nNULL  for their office phones because they do not have an office (that is, office phone \\ndoes not apply  to these students). Another student has a NULL  for home phone, presum-\\nably because either he does not have a home phone or he has one but we do not know it \\n(value is unknown ). In general, we can have several meanings for NULL  values, such as \\nvalue unknown , value  exists but is not available , or attribute does not apply  to this tuple \\n(also known as value undefined ). An example of the last type of NULL  will occur if we \\nadd an attribute Visa_status  to the STUDENT  relation that applies only to tuples repre-\\nsenting foreign students. It is possible to devise different codes for different meanings of \\n5We will use the alternative definition of relation when we discuss query processing and optimization in \\nChapter 18.\\n6We discuss this assumption in more detail in Chapter 14.\\n7Extensions of the relational model remove these restrictions. For example, object-relational systems \\n(Chapter 12) allow complex-structured attributes, as do the non-first normal form  or nested  relational \\nmodels.t = < (Name, Dick Davidson),(Ssn, 422-11-2320),(Home_phone, NULL),(Address, 3452 Elgin Road),\\n   (Office_phone, (817)749-1253),(Age, 25),(Gpa, 3.53)>\\nt = < (Address, 3452 Elgin Road),(Name, Dick Davidson),(Ssn, 422-11-2320),(Age, 25),\\n    (Office_phone, (817)749-1253),(Gpa, 3.53),(Home_phone, NULL)>\\nFigure 5.3 \\nTwo identical tuples when the order of attributes and values is not part of relation definition.'),\n",

Incorporating different types of NULL  values into relational model opera-\\ntions has proven difficult and is outside the scope of our presentation.\\nThe exact meaning of a NULL  value governs how it fares during arithmetic aggrega-\\ntions or comparisons with other values. For example, a comparison of two NULL  \\nvalues leads to ambiguities—if both Customer A and B have NULL  addresses, it does \\nnot mean  they have the same address. During database design, it is best to avoid \\nNULL  values as much as possible. We will discuss this further in Chapters 7 and 8 in \\nthe context of operations and queries, and in Chapter 14 in the context of database design and normalization.\\nInterpretation (Meaning) of a Relation. The relation schema can be interpreted \\nas a declaration or a type of assertion . For example, the schema of the \\nSTUDENT  \\nrelation of Figure 5.1 asserts that, in general, a student entity has a Name , Ssn, \\nHome_phone , Address , Office_phone , Age, and Gpa. Each tuple in the relation can \\nthen be interpreted as a fact or a particular instance of the assertion. For example, \\nthe first tuple in Figure 5.1 asserts the fact that there is a STUDENT  whose Name  is \\nBenjamin Bayer, Ssn is 305-61-2435, Age is 19, and so on.\\nNotice that some relations may represent facts about entities,  whereas other rela-\\ntions may represent facts about relationships.  For example, a relation schema \\nMAJORS  (Student_ssn, Department_code ) asserts that students major in academic \\ndisciplines. A tuple in this relation relates a student to his or her major discipline. \\nHence, the relational model represents facts about both entities and relationships \\nuniformly  as relations. This sometimes compromises understandability because \\none has to guess whether a relation represents an entity type or a relationship type. We introduced the entity–relationship (ER) model in detail in Chapter 3, where the entity and relationship concepts were described in detail. The mapping procedures \\nin Chapter 9 show how different constructs of the ER/EER conceptual data models \\n(see Part 2) get converted to relations.\\nAn alternative interpretation of a relation schema is as a predicate ; in this case, the \\nvalues in each tuple are interpreted as values that satisfy  the predicate. For example, \\nthe predicate \\nSTUDENT  (Name , Ssn, …) is true for the five tuples in relation STUDENT  \\nof Figure 5.1. These tuples represent five different propositions or facts in the \\nreal world. This interpretation is quite useful in the context of logical programming \\nlanguages, such as Prolog, because it allows the relational model to be used within these languages (see Section 26.5). An assumption called the closed world assumption  \\nstates that the only true facts in the universe are those present within the extension (state) of the relation(s). Any other combination of values makes the predicate false. This interpretation is useful when we consider queries on relations based on  relational calculus in Section 8.6.\\n5.1.3 Relational Model Notation\\nWe will use the following notation in our presentation:\\n ■A relation schema R of degree n is denoted by R(A1, A2, … , An).'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 187}, page_content='5.2 Relational Model Constraints and Relational Database Schemas  157\\n ■The uppercase letters Q, R, S denote relation names.\\n ■The lowercase letters q, r, s denote relation states.\\n ■The letters t, u, v denote tuples.\\n ■In general, the name of a relation schema such as STUDENT  also indicates \\nthe current set of tuples in that relation—the current relation state —whereas \\nSTUDENT (Name , Ssn, …) refers only to the relation schema.\\n ■An attribute A can be qualified with the relation name R to which it belongs \\nby using the dot notation R.A—for example, STUDENT.Name  or  \\nSTUDENT.Age . This is because the same name may be used for two attri-\\nbutes in different relations. However, all attribute names in a particular \\nrelation  must be distinct.\\n ■An n-tuple t in a relation r(R) is denoted by t = <v1, v2, … , vn>, where vi is \\nthe value corresponding to attribute Ai. The following notation refers to \\ncomponent values  of tuples:\\n /box4Both t[Ai] and t.Ai (and sometimes t[i]) refer to the value vi in t for attri-\\nbute Ai.\\n /box4Both t[Au, Aw, … , Az] and t.(Au, Aw, … , Az), where Au, Aw, … , Az is a list \\nof attributes from R, refer to the subtuple of values <vu, vw, … , vz> from t \\ncorresponding to the attributes specified in the list.\\nAs an example, consider the tuple t = <’Barbara Benson’, ‘533-69-1238’,  \\n‘(817)839-8461’, ‘7384 Fontana Lane’, NULL , 19, 3.25> from the STUDENT  relation in Fig-\\nure 5.1; we have t[Name ] = <‘Barbara Benson’>, and t[Ssn, Gpa, Age] = <‘533-69-1238’, \\n3.25, 19>.\\n5.2  Relational Model Constraints  \\nand Relational Database Schemas\\nSo far, we have discussed the characteristics of single relations. In a relational data-\\nbase, there will typically be many relations, and the tuples in those relations are \\nusually related in various ways. The state of the whole database will correspond to \\nthe states of all its relations at a particular point in time. There are generally many restrictions or constraints  on the actual values in a database state. These constraints \\nare derived from the rules in the miniworld that the database represents, as we dis-cussed in Section 1.6.8.\\nIn this section, we discuss the various restrictions on data that can be specified on a \\nrelational database in the form of constraints. Constraints on databases can gener-ally be divided into three main categories:\\n  1. Constraints that are inherent in the data model. We call these inherent \\nmodel-based constraints  or implicit constraints .\\n  2. Constraints that can be directly expressed in the schemas of the data model, typi-\\ncally by specifying them in the DDL (data definition language, see Section 2.3.1). \\nWe call these schema-based constraints  or explicit constraints .'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 188}, page_content='158 Chapter 5 The Relational Data Model and Relational Database Constraints\\n  3. Constraints that cannot  be directly expressed in the schemas of the data \\nmodel, and hence must be expressed and enforced by the application pro-grams or in some other way. We call these application-based  or semantic \\nconstraints  or business rules .\\nThe characteristics of relations that we discussed in Section 5.1.2 are the inherent \\nconstraints of the relational model and belong to the first category. For example, the \\nconstraint that a relation cannot have duplicate tuples is an inherent constraint. The \\nconstraints we discuss in this section are of the second category, namely, constraints that can be expressed in the schema of the relational model via the DDL. Constraints in the third category are more general, relate to the meaning as well as behavior of attributes, and are difficult to express and enforce within the data model, so they are usually checked within the application programs that perform database updates. In some cases, these constraints can be specified as assertions  in SQL (see Chapter 7).\\nAnother important category of constraints is data dependencies , which include \\nfunctional dependencies  and multivalued dependencies . They are used mainly for \\ntesting the “goodness” of the design of a relational database and are utilized in a process called normalization , which is discussed in Chapters 14 and 15.\\nThe schema-based constraints include domain constraints, key constraints, con-\\nstraints on \\nNULLs , entity integrity constraints, and referential integrity constraints.\\n5.2.1 Domain Constraints\\nDomain constraints specify that within each tuple, the value of each attribute A must \\nbe an atomic value from the domain dom( A). We have already discussed the ways in \\nwhich domains can be specified in Section 5.1.1. The data types associated with domains typically include standard numeric data types for integers (such as short integer, integer, and long integer) and real numbers (float and double-precision float). Characters, Booleans, fixed-length strings, and variable-length strings are also avail-able, as are date, time, timestamp, and other special data types. Domains can also be described by a subrange of values from a data type or as an enumerated data type in which all possible values are explicitly listed. Rather than describe these in detail here, we discuss the data types offered by the SQL relational standard in Section 6.1.\\n5.2.2 Key Constraints and Constraints on NULL Values\\nIn the formal relational model, a relation  is defined as a set of tuples.  By definition, \\nall elements of a set are distinct; hence, all tuples in a relation must also be distinct. This means that no two tuples can have the same combination of values for all their \\nattributes. Usually, there are other subsets of attributes  of a relation schema R with \\nthe property that no two tuples in any relation state r of R should have the same \\ncombination of values for these attributes. Suppose that we denote one such subset of attributes by SK; then for any two distinct  tuples t\\n1 and t2 in a relation state r of R, \\nwe have the constraint that:\\nt1[SK] ≠ t2[SK]'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 189}, page_content='5.2 Relational Model Constraints and Relational Database Schemas  159\\nAny such set of attributes SK is called a superkey  of the relation schema R. A super-\\nkey SK specifies a uniqueness constraint  that no two distinct tuples in any state r of \\nR can have the same value for SK. Every relation has at least one default superkey—\\nthe set of all its attributes. A superkey can have redundant attributes, however, so a more useful concept is that of a key, which has no redundancy. A key k of a relation \\nschema R is a superkey of R with the additional property that removing any attri-\\nbute A from K leaves a set of attributes K′ that is not a superkey of R any more. \\nHence, a key satisfies two properties:\\n  1. Two distinct tuples in any state of the relation cannot have identical values for (all) the attributes in the key. This uniqueness  property also applies to a \\nsuperkey.\\n  2. It is a minimal superkey —that is, a superkey from which we cannot remove \\nany attributes and still have the uniqueness constraint hold. This minimality  \\nproperty is required for a key but is optional for a superkey.\\nHence, a key is a superkey but not vice versa. A superkey may be a key (if it is mini-\\nmal) or may not be a key (if it is not minimal). Consider the STUDENT  relation of \\nFigure 5.1. The attribute set { Ssn} is a key of STUDENT  because no two student \\ntuples can have the same value for Ssn.8 Any set of attributes that includes Ssn—for \\nexample, { Ssn, Name , Age}—is a superkey. However, the superkey { Ssn, Name , Age} \\nis not a key of STUDENT  because removing Name  or Age or both from the set still \\nleaves us with a superkey. In general, any superkey formed from a single attribute is \\nalso a key. A key with multiple attributes must require all its attributes together to \\nhave the uniqueness property.\\nThe value of a key attribute can be used to identify uniquely each tuple in the rela-\\ntion. For example, the Ssn value 305-61-2435 identifies uniquely the tuple corre-\\nsponding to Benjamin Bayer in the STUDENT  relation. Notice that a set of attributes \\nconstituting a key is a property of the relation schema; it is a constraint that should hold on every  valid relation state of the schema. A key is determined from the mean-\\ning of the attributes, and the property is time-invariant:  It must continue to hold \\nwhen we insert new tuples in the relation. For example, we cannot and should not designate the \\nName  attribute of the STUDENT  relation in Figure 5.1 as a key because \\nit is possible that two students with identical names will exist at some point in a \\nvalid state.9\\nIn general, a relation schema may have more than one key. In this case, each of the \\nkeys is called a candidate key . For example, the CAR  relation in Figure 5.4 has two \\ncandidate keys: License_number  and Engine_serial_number . It is common to designate \\none of the candidate keys as the primary key  of the relation. This is the candidate \\nkey whose values are used to identify  tuples in the relation. We use the convention \\nthat the attributes that form the primary key of a relation schema are underlined, as \\nshown in Figure 5.4. Notice that when a relation schema has several candidate keys, \\n8Note that Ssn is also a superkey.\\n9Names are sometimes used as keys, but then some artifact—such as appending an ordinal number—must \\nbe used to distinguish between persons with identical names.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 190}, page_content='160 Chapter 5 The Relational Data Model and Relational Database Constraints\\nthe choice of one to become the primary key is somewhat arbitrary; however, it is \\nusually better to choose a primary key with a single attribute or a small number of attributes. The other candidate keys are designated as unique keys  and are \\nnot underlined.\\nAnother constraint on attributes specifies whether \\nNULL  values are or are not per-\\nmitted. For example, if every STUDENT  tuple must have a valid, non- NULL  value for \\nthe Name  attribute, then Name  of STUDENT  is constrained to be NOT NULL .\\n5.2.3 Relational Databases and Relational  \\nDatabase Schemas\\nThe definitions and constraints we have discussed so far apply to single relations \\nand their attributes. A relational database usually contains many relations, with tuples in relations that are related in various ways. In this section, we define a rela-tional database and a relational database schema.\\nA relational database schema  S is a set of relation schemas S = {R\\n1, R2, … , Rm} and \\na set of integrity constraints  IC. A relational database state10 DB of S is a set of \\nrelation states DB = { r1, r2, … , rm} such that each ri is a state of Ri and such that the \\nri relation states satisfy the integrity constraints specified in IC. Figure 5.5 shows a \\nrelational database schema that we call COMPANY  = {EMPLOYEE , DEPARTMENT , \\nDEPT_LOCATIONS , PROJECT , WORKS_ON , DEPENDENT }. In each relation schema, \\nthe underlined attribute represents the primary key. Figure 5.6 shows a relational database state corresponding to the \\nCOMPANY  schema. We will use this schema \\nand database state in this chapter and in Chapters 4 through 6 for developing sample queries in different relational languages. (The data shown here is expanded and available for loading as a populated database from the Compan-ion Website for the text, and can be used for the hands-on project exercises at the end of the chapters.)\\nWhen we refer to a relational database, we implicitly include both its schema and its \\ncurrent state. A database state that does not obey all the integrity constraints is CAR\\nLicense_number Engine_serial_number Make Model Year\\nTexas ABC-739\\nFlorida TVP-347\\nNew York MPO-22\\nCalifornia 432-TFY\\nCalifornia RSK-629\\nTexas RSK-629A69352\\nB43696\\nX83554\\nC43742\\nY82935\\nU028365Ford\\nOldsmobile\\nOldsmobile\\nMercedes\\nToyota\\nJaguarMustang\\nCutlass\\nDelta\\n190-D\\nCamry\\nXJS02\\n05\\n01\\n99\\n04\\n04Figure 5.4 \\nThe CAR relation, with two candidate keys: License_number and Engine_serial_number.\\n10A relational database state is sometimes called a relational database snapshot  or instance . However, \\nas we mentioned earlier, we will not use the term instance  since it also applies to single tuples.'),\n",

That same concept is called \\nDno in EMPLOYEE  and Dnum  in PROJECT . Attributes that \\nrepresent the same real-world concept may or may not have identical names in dif-ferent relations. Alternatively, attributes that represent different concepts may have the same name in different relations. For example, we could have used the attribute name \\nName  for both Pname  of PROJECT  and Dname  of DEPARTMENT ; in this case, we \\nwould have two attributes that share the same name but represent different real-world concepts—project names and department names.\\nIn some early versions of the relational model, an assumption was made that the \\nsame real-world concept, when represented by an attribute, would have identical  \\nattribute names in all relations. This creates problems when the same real-world concept is used in different roles (meanings) in the same relation. For example, the concept of Social Security number appears twice in the \\nEMPLOYEE  relation of \\nFigure 5.5: once in the role of the employee’s SSN, and once in the role of the supervisor’s SSN. We are required to give them distinct attribute names—\\nSsn and \\nSuper_ssn , respectively—because they appear in the same relation and in order to \\ndistinguish their meaning.\\nEach relational DBMS must have a data definition language (DDL) for defining a \\nrelational database schema.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 193}, page_content='5.2 Relational Model Constraints and Relational Database Schemas  163\\nIntegrity constraints are specified on a database schema and are expected to hold on \\nevery valid database state  of that schema. In addition to domain, key, and NOT NULL  \\nconstraints, two other types of constraints are considered part of the relational model: entity integrity and referential integrity.\\n5.2.4 Entity Integrity, Referential Integrity, and Foreign Keys\\nThe entity integrity constraint  states that no primary key value can be NULL . This is \\nbecause the primary key value is used to identify individual tuples in a relation. Hav-ing \\nNULL  values for the primary key implies that we cannot identify some tuples. For \\nexample, if two or more tuples had NULL  for their primary keys, we may not be able \\nto distinguish them if we try to reference them from other relations.\\nKey constraints and entity integrity constraints are specified on individual relations. \\nThe referential integrity constraint  is specified between two relations and is used to \\nmaintain the consistency among tuples in the two relations. Informally, the referen-tial integrity constraint states that a tuple in one relation that refers to another rela-tion must refer to an existing tuple  in that relation. For example, in Figure 5.6, the \\nattribute \\nDno of EMPLOYEE  gives the department number for which each employee \\nworks; hence, its value in every EMPLOYEE  tuple must match the Dnumber  value of \\nsome tuple in the DEPARTMENT  relation.\\nTo define referential integrity  more formally, first we define the concept of a foreign \\nkey. The conditions for a foreign key, given below, specify a referential integrity \\nconstraint between the two relation schemas R1 and R2. A set of attributes FK in \\nrelation schema R1 is a foreign key  of R1 that references  relation R2 if it satisfies the \\nfollowing rules:\\n  1. The attributes in FK have the same domain(s) as the primary key attributes PK of R\\n2; the attributes FK are said to reference  or refer to  the relation R2.\\n  2. A value of FK in a tuple t1 of the current state r1(R1) either occurs as a value \\nof PK for some tuple t2 in the current state r2(R2) or is NULL . In the former \\ncase, we have t1[FK] = t2[PK], and we say that the tuple t1 references  or \\nrefers to  the tuple t2.\\nIn this definition, R1 is called the referencing relation  and R2 is the referenced \\nrelation . If these two conditions hold, a referential integrity constraint  from R1 to \\nR2 is said to hold. In a database of many relations, there are usually many referential \\nintegrity constraints.\\nTo specify these constraints, first we must have a clear understanding of the mean-\\ning or role that each attribute or set of attributes plays in the various relation sche-mas of the database. Referential integrity constraints typically arise from the relationships among the entities  represented by the relation schemas. For example, \\nconsider the database shown in Figure 5.6. In the \\nEMPLOYEE  relation, the attribute \\nDno refers to the department for which an employee works; hence, we designate Dno \\nto be a foreign key of EMPLOYEE  referencing the DEPARTMENT  relation. This means \\nthat a value of Dno in any tuple t1 of the EMPLOYEE  relation must match a value of'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 194}, page_content='164 Chapter 5 The Relational Data Model and Relational Database Constraints\\nthe primary key of DEPARTMENT —the Dnumber  attribute—in some tuple t2 of the \\nDEPARTMENT  relation, or the value of Dno can be NULL  if the employee does not \\nbelong to a department or will be assigned to a department later. For example, in Figure 5.6 the tuple for employee ‘John Smith’ references the tuple for the ‘Research’ department, indicating that ‘John Smith’ works for this department.\\nNotice that a foreign key can refer to its own relation.  For example, the attribute \\nSuper_ssn  in EMPLOYEE  refers to the supervisor of an employee; this is another \\nemployee, represented by a tuple in the EMPLOYEE  relation. Hence, Super_ssn  is a \\nforeign key that references the EMPLOYEE  relation itself. In Figure 5.6 the tuple for \\nemployee ‘John Smith’ references the tuple for employee ‘Franklin Wong,’ indicat-ing that ‘Franklin Wong’ is the supervisor of ‘John Smith’.\\nWe can diagrammatically display referential integrity constraints  by drawing a directed \\narc from each foreign key to the relation it references. For clarity, the arrowhead may point to the primary key of the referenced relation. Figure 5.7 shows the schema in Figure 5.5 with the referential integrity constraints displayed in this manner.\\nAll integrity constraints should be specified on the relational database schema (that is, \\nspecified as part of its definition) if we want the DBMS to enforce these constraints on \\nDEPART MENTFname Minit Lname Ssn Bdate Address Sex Salary Super_ssn DnoEMPLOYEE\\nDEPT_LOCATIONS\\nDnumber Dlocation\\nPROJECT\\nPname Pnumber Plocation Dnum\\nWORKS_ON\\nEssn Pno Hours\\nDEPENDENT\\nEssn Dependent_name Sex Bdate RelationshipDname Dnumber Mgr_ssn Mgr_start_dateFigure 5.7 \\nReferential integrity constraints displayed on the COMPANY relational database schema.'),\n",

Hence, the DDL includes provisions for specifying the various \\ntypes of constraints so that the DBMS can automatically enforce them. In SQL, the CREATE TABLE statement of the SQL DDL allows the definition of primary key, unique key, NOT NULL, entity integrity, and referential integrity constraints, among other constraints (see Sections 6.1 and 6.2) .\\n5.2.5 Other Types of Constraints\\nThe preceding integrity constraints are included in the data definition language because they occur in most database applications. Another class of general con-straints, sometimes called semantic integrity constraints,  are not part of the DDL \\nand have to be specified and enforced in a different way. Examples of such con-straints are the salary of an employee should not exceed the salary of the employee’s \\nsupervisor  and the maximum number of hours an employee can work on all projects \\nper week is 56 . Such constraints can be specified and enforced within the applica-\\ntion programs that update the database, or by using a general-purpose constraint \\nspecification language . Mechanisms called triggers  and assertions  can be used in \\nSQL, through the \\nCREATE ASSERTION  and CREATE TRIGGER  statements, to specify \\nsome of these constraints (see Chapter 7). It is more common to check for these \\ntypes of constraints within the application programs than to use constraint specifi-\\ncation languages because the latter are sometimes difficult and complex to use, as we discuss in Section 26.1.\\nThe types of constraints we discussed so far may be called state constraints  \\nbecause they define the constraints that a valid state  of the database must satisfy. \\nAnother type of constraint, called transition constraints , can be defined to deal \\nwith state changes in the database.\\n11 An example of a transition constraint is: “the \\nsalary of an employee can only increase.” Such constraints are typically enforced by the application programs or specified using active rules and triggers, as we dis-cuss in Section 26.1.\\n5.3  Update Operations, Transactions,  \\nand Dealing with Constraint Violations\\nThe operations of the relational model can be categorized into retrievals  and \\nupdates.  The relational algebra operations, which can be used to specify retrievals , \\nare discussed in detail in Chapter 8. A relational algebra expression forms a new relation after applying a number of algebraic operators to an existing set of rela-tions; its main use is for querying a database to retrieve information. The user for-mulates a query that specifies the data of interest, and a new relation is formed by applying relational operators to retrieve this data. The result relation  becomes the \\nanswer to (or result of) the user’s query. Chapter 8 also introduces the language \\n11State constraints are sometimes called static constraints , and transition constraints are sometimes \\ncalled dynamic constraints .'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 196}, page_content='166 Chapter 5 The Relational Data Model and Relational Database Constraints\\ncalled relational calculus, which is used to define a query declaratively without giv-\\ning a specific order of operations.\\nIn this section, we concentrate on the database modification  or update  operations. \\nThere are three basic operations that can change the states of relations in the data-base: Insert, Delete, and Update (or Modify). They insert new data, delete old data, or modify existing data records, respectively. Insert  is used to insert one or more \\nnew tuples in a relation, Delete  is used to delete tuples, and Update  (or Modify ) is \\nused to change the values of some attributes in existing tuples. Whenever these operations are applied, the integrity constraints specified on the relational database schema should not be violated. In this section we discuss the types of constraints that may be violated by each of these operations and the types of actions that may be taken if an operation causes a violation. We use the database shown in Figure 5.6 for examples and discuss only domain constraints, key constraints, entity integrity constraints, and the referential integrity constraints shown in Figure 5.7. For each type of operation, we give some examples and discuss any constraints that each operation may violate.\\n5.3.1 The Insert Operation\\nThe Insert  operation provides a list of attribute values for a new tuple t that is to be \\ninserted into a relation R. Insert can violate any of the four types of constraints. \\nDomain constraints can be violated if an attribute value is given that does not appear in the corresponding domain or is not of the appropriate data type. Key constraints can be violated if a key value in the new tuple t already exists in another \\ntuple in the relation r(R). Entity integrity can be violated if any part of the primary \\nkey of the new tuple t is \\nNULL . Referential integrity can be violated if the value of \\nany foreign key in t refers to a tuple that does not exist in the referenced relation. \\nHere are some examples to illustrate this discussion.\\n ■Operation :\\nInsert <‘Cecilia’ , ‘F’ , ‘Kolonsky’ , NULL , ‘1960-04-05’ , ‘6357 Windy Lane, Katy, \\nTX’ , F, 28000, NULL , 4> into EMPLOYEE .\\nResult : This insertion violates the entity integrity constraint ( NULL  for the \\nprimary key Ssn), so it is rejected.\\n ■Operation :\\nInsert <‘ Alicia’ , ‘J’ , ‘Zelaya’ , ‘999887777’ , ‘1960-04-05’ , ‘6357 Windy Lane, Katy, TX’ , F, 28000, ‘987654321’ , 4> into \\nEMPLOYEE .\\nResult : This insertion violates the key constraint because another tuple with \\nthe same Ssn value already exists in the EMPLOYEE  relation, and so it is \\nrejected.\\n ■Operation :\\nInsert <‘Cecilia’ , ‘F’ , ‘Kolonsky’ , ‘677678989’ , ‘1960-04-05’ , ‘6357 Windswept, \\nKaty, TX’ , F, 28000, ‘987654321’ , 7> into EMPLOYEE .\\nResult : This insertion violates the referential integrity constraint specified on \\nDno in EMPLOYEE  because no corresponding referenced tuple exists in \\nDEPARTMENT  with Dnumber  = 7.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 197}, page_content='5.3 Update Operations, Transactions, and Dealing with Constraint Violations  167\\n ■Operation :\\nInsert <‘Cecilia’ , ‘F’ , ‘Kolonsky’ , ‘677678989’ , ‘1960-04-05’ , ‘6357 Windy Lane, Katy, TX’ , F, 28000, \\nNULL , 4> into EMPLOYEE .\\nResult : This insertion satisfies all constraints, so it is acceptable.\\nIf an insertion violates one or more constraints, the default option is to reject the \\ninsertion.  In this case, it would be useful if the DBMS could provide a reason to the \\nuser as to why the insertion was rejected. Another option is to attempt to correct the \\nreason for rejecting the insertion,  but this is typically not used for violations caused by \\nInsert ; rather, it is used more often in correcting violations for Delete and Update. \\nIn the first operation, the DBMS could ask the user to provide a value for Ssn, and \\ncould then accept the insertion if a valid Ssn value is provided. In operation 3, the \\nDBMS could either ask the user to change the value of Dno to some valid value  \\n(or set it to NULL ), or it could ask the user to insert a DEPARTMENT  tuple with  \\nDnumber  = 7 and could accept the original insertion only after such an operation \\nwas accepted. Notice that in the latter case the insertion violation can cascade  back \\nto the EMPLOYEE  relation if the user attempts to insert a tuple for department 7 with \\na value for Mgr_ssn  that does not exist in the EMPLOYEE  relation.\\n5.3.2 The Delete Operation\\nThe Delete  operation can violate only referential integrity. This occurs if the tuple \\nbeing deleted is referenced by foreign keys from other tuples in the database. To specify deletion, a condition on the attributes of the relation selects the tuple (or tuples) to be deleted. Here are some examples.\\n ■Operation :\\nDelete the WORKS_ON  tuple with Essn  = ‘999887777’ and Pno = 10.\\nResult : This deletion is acceptable and deletes exactly one tuple.\\n ■Operation :\\nDelete the EMPLOYEE  tuple with Ssn = ‘999887777’ .\\nResult : This deletion is not acceptable, because there are tuples in  \\nWORKS_ON  that refer to this tuple. Hence, if the tuple in EMPLOYEE  is \\ndeleted, referential integrity violations will result.\\n ■Operation :\\nDelete the EMPLOYEE  tuple with Ssn = ‘333445555’ .\\nResult : This deletion will result in even worse referential integrity violations, \\nbecause the tuple involved is referenced by tuples from the EMPLOYEE , \\nDEPARTMENT , WORKS_ON , and DEPENDENT  relations.\\nSeveral options are available if a deletion operation causes a violation. The first \\noption, called restrict,  is to reject the deletion.  The second option, called cascade,  is \\nto attempt to cascade (or propagate) the deletion  by deleting tuples that reference the \\ntuple that is being deleted. For example, in operation 2, the DBMS could automati-cally delete the offending tuples from \\nWORKS_ON  with Essn  = ‘999887777’. A \\nthird option, called set null  or set default,  is to modify the referencing attribute \\nvalues  that cause the violation; each such value is either set to NULL  or changed to'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 198}, page_content='168 Chapter 5 The Relational Data Model and Relational Database Constraints\\nreference another default valid tuple. Notice that if a referencing attribute that \\ncauses a violation is part of the primary key,  it cannot  be set to NULL ; otherwise, it \\nwould violate entity integrity.\\nCombinations of these three options are also possible. For example, to avoid having \\noperation 3 cause a violation, the DBMS may automatically delete all tuples from \\nWORKS_ON  and DEPENDENT  with Essn  = ‘333445555’. Tuples in EMPLOYEE  with \\nSuper_ssn  = ‘333445555’ and the tuple in DEPARTMENT  with Mgr_ssn  = ‘333445555’ \\ncan have their Super_ssn  and Mgr_ssn  values changed to other valid values or to \\nNULL . Although it may make sense to delete automatically the WORKS_ON  and \\nDEPENDENT  tuples that refer to an EMPLOYEE  tuple, it may not make sense to delete \\nother EMPLOYEE  tuples or a DEPARTMENT  tuple.\\nIn general, when a referential integrity constraint is specified in the DDL, the DBMS \\nwill allow the database designer to specify which of the options  applies in case of a \\nviolation of the constraint. We discuss how to specify these options in the SQL DDL in Chapter 6.\\n5.3.3 The Update Operation\\nThe Update  (or Modify ) operation is used to change the values of one or more \\nattributes in a tuple (or tuples) of some relation R. It is necessary to specify a condi-\\ntion on the attributes of the relation to select the tuple (or tuples) to be modified. \\nHere are some examples.\\n ■Operation :\\nUpdate the salary of the EMPLOYEE  tuple with Ssn = ‘999887777’ to 28000.\\nResult : Acceptable.\\n ■Operation :\\nUpdate the Dno of the EMPLOYEE  tuple with Ssn = ‘999887777’ to 1.\\nResult : Acceptable.\\n ■Operation :\\nUpdate the Dno of the EMPLOYEE  tuple with Ssn = ‘999887777’ to 7.\\nResult : Unacceptable, because it violates referential integrity.\\n ■Operation :\\nUpdate the Ssn of the EMPLOYEE  tuple with Ssn = ‘999887777’ to ‘987654321’ .\\nResult : Unacceptable, because it violates primary key constraint by repeating \\na value that already exists as a primary key in another tuple; it violates refer-ential integrity constraints because there are other relations that refer to the existing value of \\nSsn.\\nUpdating an attribute that is neither part of a primary key nor part of a foreign key  \\nusually causes no problems; the DBMS need only check to confirm that the new \\nvalue is of the correct data type and domain. Modifying a primary key value is simi-\\nlar to deleting one tuple and inserting another in its place because we use the pri-\\nmary key to identify tuples. Hence, the issues discussed earlier in both Sections 5.3.1 \\n(Insert) and 5.3.2 (Delete) come into play. If a foreign key attribute is modified, the'),\n",

Similar options exist to deal with referential integ-\\nrity violations caused by Update as those options discussed for the Delete operation. In fact, when a referential integrity constraint is specified in the DDL, the DBMS will allow the user to choose separate options to deal with a violation caused by Delete and a violation caused by Update (see Section 6.2).\\n5.3.4 The Transaction Concept\\nA database application program running against a relational database typically exe-cutes one or more transactions . A transaction  is an executing program that includes \\nsome database operations, such as reading from the database, or applying inser-tions, deletions, or updates to the database. At the end of the transaction, it must leave the database in a valid or consistent state that satisfies all the constraints spec-ified on the database schema. A single transaction may involve any number of retrieval operations (to be discussed as part of relational algebra and calculus in Chapter 8, and as a part of the language SQL in Chapters 6 and 7) and any number of update operations. These retrievals and updates will together form an atomic unit of work against the database. For example, a transaction to apply a bank with-drawal will typically read the user account record, check if there is a sufficient bal-ance, and then update the record by the withdrawal amount.\\nA large number of commercial applications running against relational databases in \\nonline transaction processing (OLTP ) systems are executing transactions at rates \\nthat reach several hundred per second. Transaction processing concepts, concur-rent execution of transactions, and recovery from failures will be discussed in Chapters 20 to 22.\\n5.4 Summary\\nIn this chapter we presented the modeling concepts, data structures, and constraints provided by the relational model of data. We started by introducing the concepts of \\ndomains, attributes, and tuples. Then, we defined a relation schema as a list of attri-\\nbutes that describe the structure of a relation. A relation, or relation state, is a set of tuples that conforms to the schema.\\nSeveral characteristics differentiate relations from ordinary tables or files. The first \\nis that a relation is not sensitive to the ordering of tuples. The second involves the \\nordering of attributes in a relation schema and the corresponding ordering of val-\\nues within a tuple. We gave an alternative definition of relation that does not require \\nordering of attributes, but we continued to use the first definition, which requires attributes and tuple values to be ordered, for convenience. Then, we discussed val-ues in tuples and introduced \\nNULL  values to represent missing or unknown infor-\\nmation. We emphasized that NULL  values should be avoided as much as possible.\\nWe classified database constraints into inherent model-based constraints, explicit \\nschema-based constraints, and semantic constraints or business rules. Then, we'),\n",

We defined \\nrelational databases and relational database schemas. Additional relational con-straints include the entity integrity constraint, which prohibits primary key attri-butes from being \\nNULL . We described the interrelation referential integrity \\nconstraint, which is used to maintain consistency of references among tuples from various relations.\\nThe modification operations on the relational model are Insert, Delete, and Update. \\nEach operation may violate certain types of constraints (refer to Section 5.3). When-ever an operation is applied, the resulting database state must be a valid state.

Codd also \\nintroduced relational algebra and laid the theoretical foundations for the relational model in a series of papers (Codd, 1971, 1972, 1972a, 1974); he was later given the Turing Award, the highest honor of the ACM (Association for Computing Machin-ery) for his work on the relational model. In a later paper, Codd (1979) discussed extending the relational model to incorporate more meta-data and semantics about the relations; he also proposed a three-valued logic to deal with uncertainty in rela-tions and incorporating \\nNULLs  in the relational algebra. The resulting model is \\nknown as RM/T. Childs (1968) had earlier used set theory to model databases. Later, Codd (1990) published a book examining over 300 features of the relational data model and database systems. Date (2001) provides a retrospective review and analysis of the relational data model.\\nSince Codd’s pioneering work, much research has been conducted on various \\naspects of the relational model. Todd (1976) describes an experimental DBMS called PRTV that directly implements the relational algebra operations. Schmidt and Swenson (1975) introduce additional semantics into the relational model by classifying different types of relations. Chen’s (1976) entity–relationship model, which is discussed in Chapter 3, is a means to communicate the real-world seman-tics of a relational database at the conceptual level.

Because it became a standard for relational databases, users were \\nless concerned about migrating their database applications from other types of database systems—for example, older network or hierarchical systems—to rela-tional systems. This is because even if the users became dissatisfied with the partic-ular relational DBMS product they were using, converting to another relational DBMS product was not expected to be too expensive and time-consuming because both systems followed the same language standards. In practice, of course, there are differences among various commercial relational DBMS packages. However, if the user is diligent in using only those features that are part of the standard, and if two relational DBMSs faithfully support the standard, then conversion between two systems should be simplified. Another advantage of having such a standard is that users may write statements in a database application program that can access data stored in two or more relational DBMSs without having to change the database sublanguage (SQL), as long as both/all of the relational \\nDBMSs support standard SQL.\\nThis chapter presents the practical  relational model, which is based on the SQL \\nstandard for commercial  relational DBMSs, whereas Chapter 5 presented the most \\nimportant concepts underlying the formal  relational data model. In Chapter 8 (Sec-\\ntions 8.1 through 8.5 ), we shall discuss the relational algebra  operations, which are \\nvery important for understanding the types of requests that may be specified on a relational database. They are also important for query processing and optimization in a relational DBMS, as we shall see in Chapters 18 and 19. However, the relational algebra operations are too low-level for most commercial DBMS users because a query in relational algebra is written as a sequence of operations that, when exe-cuted, produces the required result. Hence, the user must specify how—that is, in \\nwhat order— to execute the query operations. On the other hand, the SQL language chapter 6'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 208}, page_content='178 Chapter 6 Basic SQL\\nprovides a higher-level declarative  language interface, so the user only specifies \\nwhat  the result is to be, leaving the actual optimization and decisions on how to \\nexecute the query to the DBMS. Although SQL includes some features from rela-tional algebra, it is based to a greater extent on the tuple relational calculus , which \\nwe describe in Section 8.6. However, the SQL syntax is more user-friendly than either of the two formal languages.\\nThe name SQL  is presently expanded as Structured Query Language. Originally, \\nSQL was called SEQUEL (Structured English QUEry Language) and was designed and implemented at IBM Research as the interface for an experimental relational database system called SYSTEM R. SQL is now the standard language for com-mercial relational DBMSs. The standardization of SQL is a joint effort by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the International Standards Organization (ISO), and the first SQL standard is called SQL-86 or SQL1. A revised and much expanded standard called SQL-92 (also referred to as SQL2) was subsequently developed. The next standard that is well-recognized is SQL:1999, which started out as SQL3. Additional updates to the standard are SQL:2003 and SQL:2006, which added XML features (see Chapter 13) among other updates to the language. Another update in 2008 incorporated more object database features into SQL (see Chapter 12), and a further update is SQL:2011. We will try to cover the latest version of SQL as much as possible, but some of the newer features are discussed in later chapters. It is also not possible to cover the language in its entirety in this text. It is important to note that when new features are added to SQL, it usually takes a few years for some of these features to make it into the commercial SQL DBMSs.\\nSQL is a comprehensive database language: It has statements for data definitions, \\nqueries, and updates. Hence, it is both a DDL and a DML. In addition, it has facili-\\nties for defining views on the database, for specifying security and authorization, for defining integrity constraints, and for specifying transaction controls. It also has rules for embedding SQL statements into a general-purpose programming lan-guage such as Java or C/C++.\\n1\\nThe later SQL standards (starting with SQL:1999 ) are divided into a core  specifica-\\ntion plus specialized extensions . The core is supposed to be implemented by all \\nRDBMS vendors that are SQL compliant. The extensions can be implemented as \\noptional modules to be purchased independently for specific database applications such as data mining, spatial data, temporal data, data warehousing, online analyti-cal processing (OLAP), multimedia data, and so on.\\nBecause the subject of SQL is both important and extensive, we devote two chap-\\nters to its basic features. In this chapter, Section 6.1 describes the SQL DDL com-mands for creating schemas and tables, and gives an overview of the basic data types in SQL. Section 6.2 presents how basic constraints such as key and referen-tial integrity are specified. Section 6.3 describes the basic SQL constructs for \\n1Originally, SQL had statements for creating and dropping indexes on the files that represent relations, \\nbut these have been dropped from the SQL standard for some time.'),\n",

We will also describe the CREATE \\nASSERTION  statement, which allows the specification of more general constraints \\non the database, and the concept of triggers, which is presented in more detail in Chapter 26. We discuss the SQL facility for defining views on the database in Chap-ter 7. Views are also called virtual  or derived tables  because they present the user \\nwith what appear to be tables; however, the information in those tables is derived from previously defined tables.\\nSection 6.5 lists some SQL features that are presented in other chapters of the book; \\nthese include object-oriented features in Chapter 12, XML in Chapter 13, transac-tion control in Chapter 20, active databases (triggers) in Chapter 26, online analyti-cal processing (OLAP) features in Chapter 29, and security/authorization in Chapter 30. Section 6.6 summarizes the chapter. Chapters 10 and 11 discuss the various database programming techniques for programming with SQL.\\n6.1 SQL Data Definition and Data Types\\nSQL uses the terms table , row, and column  for the formal relational model terms \\nrelation , tuple , and attribute , respectively. We will use the corresponding terms \\ninterchangeably. The main SQL command for data definition is the CREATE  state-\\nment, which can be used to create schemas, tables (relations), types, and domains, \\nas well as other constructs such as views, assertions, and triggers. Before we describe \\nthe relevant CREATE  statements, we discuss schema and catalog concepts in Sec-\\ntion 6.1.1 to place our discussion in perspective. Section 6.1.2 describes how tables \\nare created, and Section 6.1.3 describes the most important data types available for \\nattribute specification. Because the SQL specification is very large, we give a descrip-tion of the most important features. Further details can be found in the various SQL standards documents (see end-of-chapter bibliographic notes).\\n6.1.1 Schema and Catalog Concepts in SQL\\nEarly versions of SQL did not include the concept of a relational database schema; all tables (relations) were considered part of the same schema. The concept of an \\nSQL schema was incorporated starting with SQL2 in order to group together tables and other constructs that belong to the same database application (in some systems, a schema  is called a database ). An SQL schema  is identified by a schema name  and \\nincludes an authorization identifier  to indicate the user or account who owns the \\nschema, as well as descriptors  for each element  in the schema. Schema elements  \\ninclude tables, types, constraints, views, domains, and other constructs (such as authorization grants) that describe the schema. A schema is created via the \\nCREATE \\nSCHEMA  statement, which can include all the schema elements’ definitions. Alter-\\nnatively, the schema can be assigned a name and authorization identifier, and the'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 210}, page_content='180 Chapter 6 Basic SQL\\nelements can be defined later. For example, the following statement creates a \\nschema called COMPANY  owned by the user with authorization identifier ‘Jsmith’. \\nNote that each statement in SQL ends with a semicolon.\\nCREATE SCHEMA  COMPANY  AUTHORIZATION  ‘Jsmith’;\\nIn general, not all users are authorized to create schemas and schema elements. The \\nprivilege to create schemas, tables, and other constructs must be explicitly granted to the relevant user accounts by the system administrator or DBA.\\nIn addition to the concept of a schema, SQL uses the concept of a catalog —a named \\ncollection of schemas.\\n2 Database installations typically have a default environment \\nand schema, so when a user connects and logs in to that database installation, the user can refer directly to tables and other constructs within that schema without having to specify a particular schema name. A catalog always contains a special schema called \\nINFORMATION_SCHEMA , which provides information on all the \\nschemas in the catalog and all the element descriptors in these schemas. Integrity constraints such as referential integrity can be defined between relations only if they exist in schemas within the same catalog. Schemas within the same catalog can also share certain elements, such as type and domain definitions.\\n6.1.2 The CREATE TABLE Command in SQL\\nThe CREATE TABLE  command is used to specify a new relation by giving it a name \\nand specifying its attributes and initial constraints. The attributes are specified first, \\nand each attribute is given a name, a data type to specify its domain of values, and \\npossibly attribute constraints, such as NOT NULL . The key, entity integrity, and ref-\\nerential integrity constraints can be specified within the CREATE TABLE  statement \\nafter the attributes are declared, or they can be added later using the ALTER TABLE  \\ncommand (see Chapter 7). Figure 6.1 shows sample data definition statements in SQL for the \\nCOMPANY  relational database schema shown in Figure 3.7.\\nTypically, the SQL schema in which the relations are declared is implicitly specified \\nin the environment in which the CREATE TABLE  statements are executed. Alterna-\\ntively, we can explicitly attach the schema name to the relation name, separated by \\na period. For example, by writing\\nCREATE TABLE  COMPANY.EMPLOYEE\\nrather than\\nCREATE TABLE  EMPLOYEE\\nas in Figure 6.1, we can explicitly (rather than implicitly) make the EMPLOYEE  table \\npart of the COMPANY  schema.\\nThe relations declared through CREATE TABLE  statements are called base tables  \\n(or base relations); this means that the table and its rows are actually created \\n2SQL also includes the concept of a cluster  of catalogs.'),\n",

Base relations are distinguished from virtual \\nrelations , created through the CREATE VIEW  statement (see Chapter 7), which \\nmay or may not correspond to an actual physical file. In SQL, the attributes in a base table are considered to be ordered in the sequence in which they are speci-\\nfied in the \\nCREATE TABLE  statement. However, rows (tuples) are not considered \\nto be ordered within a table (relation).\\nIt is important to note that in Figure 6.1, there are some foreign keys that may cause \\nerrors  because they are specified either via circular references or because they refer \\nto a table that has not yet been created. For example, the foreign key Super_ssn  in \\nthe EMPLOYEE  table is a circular reference because it refers to the EMPLOYEE  table \\nitself. The foreign key Dno in the EMPLOYEE  table refers to the DEPARTMENT  table, \\nwhich has not been created yet. To deal with this type of problem, these constraints can be left out of the initial \\nCREATE TABLE  statement, and then added later using \\nthe ALTER TABLE  statement (see Chapter 7). We displayed all the foreign keys in \\nFigure 6.1 to show the complete COMPANY  schema in one place.\\n6.1.3 Attribute Data Types and Domains in SQL\\nThe basic data types  available for attributes include numeric, character string, bit \\nstring, Boolean, date, and time.\\n ■Numeric  data types include integer numbers of various sizes ( INTEGER  or \\nINT, and SMALLINT ) and floating-point (real) numbers of various precision \\n(FLOAT  or REAL , and DOUBLE PRECISION ). Formatted numbers can be \\ndeclared by using DECIMAL (i, j)—or DEC (i, j) or NUMERIC (i, j)—where i, the \\nprecision , is the total number of decimal digits and j, the scale , is the number \\nof digits after the decimal point. The default for scale is zero, and the default \\nfor precision is implementation-defined.\\n ■Character-string  data types are either fixed length— CHAR (n) or \\nCHARACTER (n), where n is the number of characters—or varying length—\\nVARCHAR (n) or CHAR VARYING (n) or CHARACTER VARYING (n), where n is \\nthe maximum number of characters. When specifying a literal string value, \\nit is placed between single quotation marks (apostrophes), and it is case sen-\\nsitive  (a distinction is made between uppercase and lowercase).3 For fixed-\\nlength strings, a shorter string is padded with blank characters to the right. \\nFor example, if the value ‘Smith’ is for an attribute of type CHAR (10), it is \\npadded with five blank characters to become ‘Smith’ if needed. Padded \\nblanks are generally ignored when strings are compared. For comparison \\npurposes, strings are considered ordered in alphabetic (or lexicographic) \\norder; if a string str1 appears before another string str2 in alphabetic order, \\nthen str1 is considered to be less than str2.4 There is also a concatenation \\noperator denoted by || (double vertical bar) that can concatenate two strings \\n3This is not the case with SQL keywords, such as CREATE or CHAR. With keywords, SQL is case insen-\\nsitive , meaning that SQL treats uppercase and lowercase letters as equivalent in keywords.\\n4For nonalphabetic characters, there is a defined order.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 213}, page_content='6.1 SQL Data Definition and Data Types  183\\nin SQL. For example, ‘abc’ || ‘XYZ’ results in a single string ‘abcXYZ’. \\nAnother variable-length string data type called CHARACTER LARGE OBJECT  \\nor CLOB  is also available to specify columns that have large text values, such \\nas documents. The CLOB maximum length can be specified in kilobytes (K), megabytes (M), or gigabytes (G). For example, \\nCLOB (20M) specifies a \\nmaximum length of 20 megabytes.\\n ■Bit-string  data types are either of fixed length n—BIT(n)—or varying length—\\nBIT VARYING (n), where n is the maximum number of bits. The default for n, \\nthe length of a character string or bit string, is 1. Literal bit strings are placed between single quotes but preceded by a \\nB to distinguish them from character \\nstrings; for example, B‘10101’.5 Another variable-length bitstring data type \\ncalled BINARY LARGE OBJECT  or BLOB  is also available to specify columns \\nthat have large binary values, such as images. As for CLOB , the maximum \\nlength of a BLOB  can be specified in kilobits (K), megabits (M), or gigabits (G). \\nFor example, BLOB (30G) specifies a maximum length of 30 gigabits.\\n ■A Boolean  data type has the traditional values of TRUE  or FALSE . In SQL, \\nbecause of the presence of NULL  values, a three-valued logic is used, so a \\nthird possible value for a Boolean data type is UNKNOWN . We discuss the \\nneed for UNKNOWN  and the three-valued logic in Chapter 7.\\n ■The DATE  data type has ten positions, and its components are YEAR , MONTH , \\nand DAY in the form YYYY-MM-DD. The TIME  data type has at least eight \\npositions, with the components HOUR , MINUTE , and SECOND  in the form \\nHH:MM:SS. Only valid dates and times should be allowed by the SQL imple-\\nmentation. This implies that months should be between 1 and 12 and days \\nmust be between 01 and 31; furthermore, a day should be a valid day for the \\ncorresponding month. The < (less than) comparison can be used with dates or times—an earlier  date is considered to be smaller than a later date, and \\nsimilarly with time. Literal values are represented by single-quoted strings preceded by the keyword \\nDATE  or TIME ; for example, DATE  ‘2014-09-27’ or \\nTIME  ‘09:12:47’. In addition, a data type TIME (i), where i is called time frac-\\ntional seconds precision , specifies i + 1 additional positions for TIME —one \\nposition for an additional period (.) separator character, and i positions for \\nspecifying decimal fractions of a second. A TIME WITH TIME ZONE  data type \\nincludes an additional six positions for specifying the displacement  from the \\nstandard universal time zone, which is in the range +13:00 to –12:59 in units \\nof HOURS:MINUTES . If WITH TIME ZONE  is not included, the default is the \\nlocal time zone for the SQL session.\\nSome additional data types are discussed below. The list of types discussed here is \\nnot exhaustive; different implementations have added more data types to SQL.\\n ■A timestamp  data type ( TIMESTAMP ) includes the DATE  and TIME  fields, plus \\na minimum of six positions for decimal fractions of seconds and an optional \\nWITH TIME ZONE  qualifier. Literal values are represented by single-quoted \\n5Bit strings whose length is a multiple of 4 can be specified in hexadecimal  notation, where the literal \\nstring is preceded by X and each hexadecimal character represents 4 bits.'),\n",

This specifies an interval —a relative value  that can be used to increment \\nor decrement an absolute value of a date, time, or timestamp. Intervals are qualified to be either \\nYEAR/MONTH  intervals or DAY/TIME  intervals.\\nThe format of DATE , TIME , and TIMESTAMP  can be considered as a special type of \\nstring. Hence, they can generally be used in string comparisons by being cast (or \\ncoerced  or converted) into the equivalent strings.\\nIt is possible to specify the data type of each attribute directly, as in Figure 6.1; alter-\\nnatively, a domain can be declared, and the domain name can be used with the attribute specification. This makes it easier to change the data type for a domain that is used by numerous attributes in a schema, and improves schema readability. For example, we can create a domain \\nSSN_TYPE by  the following statement:\\nCREATE DOMAIN  SSN_TYPE AS CHAR(9);\\nWe can use SSN_TYPE  in place of CHAR (9) in Figure 6.1 for the attributes Ssn and \\nSuper_ssn  of EMPLOYEE , Mgr_ssn  of DEPARTMENT , Essn  of WORKS_ON , and Essn  \\nof DEPENDENT . A domain can also have an optional default specification via a \\nDEFAULT  clause, as we discuss later for attributes. Notice that domains may not be \\navailable in some implementations of SQL.\\nIn SQL, there is also a CREATE TYPE  command, which can be used to create user \\ndefined types or UDTs. These can then be used either as data types for attributes, or as the basis for creating tables. We shall discuss CREATE TYPE in detail in Chap-ter 12, because it is often used in conjunction with specifying object database features that have been incorporated into more recent versions of SQL.\\n6.2 Specifying Constraints in SQL\\nThis section describes the basic constraints that can be specified in SQL as part of table creation. These include key and referential integrity constraints, restrictions on attribute domains and \\nNULL s, and constraints on individual tuples within a rela-\\ntion using the CHECK clause. We discuss the specification of more general con-straints, called assertions, in Chapter 7.\\n6.2.1 Specifying Attribute Constraints and Attribute Defaults\\nBecause SQL allows NULL s as attribute values, a constraint  NOT NULL  may be specified \\nif NULL  is not permitted for a particular attribute. This is always implicitly specified for \\nthe attributes that are part of the primary key  of each relation, but it can be specified for \\nany other attributes whose values are required not to be NULL , as shown in Figure 6.1.\\nIt is also possible to define a default value  for an attribute by appending the clause \\nDEFAULT  <value> to an attribute definition.

Figure 6.2 illustrates \\nan example of specifying a default manager for a new department and a default \\ndepartment for a new employee. If no default clause is specified, the default default \\nvalue  is NULL  for attributes that do not have  the NOT NULL  constraint.\\nAnother type of constraint can restrict attribute or domain values using the CHECK  \\nclause following an attribute or domain definition.6 For example, suppose that \\ndepartment numbers are restricted to integer numbers between 1 and 20; then, we can change the attribute declaration of \\nDnumber  in the DEPARTMENT  table (see Fig-\\nure 6.1) to the following:\\nDnumber INT NOT NULL  CHECK  (Dnumber > 0 AND  Dnumber <  21);\\nThe CHECK  clause can also be used in conjunction with the CREATE DOMAIN  state-\\nment.

Some examples to \\nillustrate the specification of keys and referential integrity are shown in Figure 6.1.7 \\nThe PRIMARY KEY  clause specifies one or more attributes that make up the primary \\nkey of a relation. If a primary key has a single  attribute, the clause can follow the \\nattribute directly. For example, the primary key of DEPARTMENT  can be specified as \\nfollows (instead of the way it is specified in Figure 6.1):\\nDnumber INT PRIMARY KEY ,\\nThe UNIQUE  clause specifies alternate (unique) keys, also known as candidate keys \\nas illustrated in the DEPARTMENT  and PROJECT  table declarations in Figure 6.1. \\nThe UNIQUE  clause can also be specified directly for a unique key if it is a single \\nattribute, as in the following example:\\nDname VARCHAR(15) UNIQUE ,\\nReferential integrity is specified via the FOREIGN KEY  clause, as shown in Fig- \\nure 6.1. As we discussed in Section 5.2.4, a referential integrity constraint can be violated when tuples are inserted or deleted, or when a foreign key or primary key attribute value is updated. The default action that SQL takes for an integrity viola-tion is to reject  the update operation that will cause a violation, which is known as \\nthe \\nRESTRICT  option. However, the schema designer can specify an alternative \\naction to be taken by attaching a referential triggered action  clause to any foreign \\nkey constraint. The options include SET NULL , CASCADE , and SET DEFAULT . An \\noption must be qualified with either ON DELETE  or ON UPDATE . We illustrate this \\nwith the examples shown in Figure 6.2. Here, the database designer chooses ON \\nDELETE SET NULL  and ON UPDATE CASCADE  for the foreign key Super_ssn  of \\nEMPLOYEE . This means that if the tuple for a supervising employee  is deleted , the \\nvalue of Super_ssn  is automatically set to NULL  for all employee tuples that were \\nreferencing the deleted employee tuple. On the other hand, if the Ssn value for a \\nsupervising employee is updated  (say, because it was entered incorrectly), the new \\nvalue is cascaded  to Super_ssn  for all employee tuples referencing the updated \\nemployee tuple.8\\nIn general, the action taken by the DBMS for SET NULL  or SET DEFAULT  is the \\nsame for both ON DELETE  and ON UPDATE : The value of the affected referencing \\nattributes is changed to NULL  for SET NULL  and to the specified default value of the \\n7Key and referential integrity constraints were not included in early versions of SQL.\\n8Notice that the foreign key Super_ssn in the EMPLOYEE table is a circular reference and hence may \\nhave to be added later as a named constraint using the AL TER TABLE statement as we discussed at the end of Section 6.1.2.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 217}, page_content='6.3 Basic Retrieval Queries in SQL  187\\nreferencing attribute for SET DEFAULT . The action for CASCADE ON DELETE  is to \\ndelete all the referencing tuples, whereas the action for CASCADE ON UPDATE  is to \\nchange the value of the referencing foreign key attribute(s) to the updated (new) primary key value for all the referencing tuples. It is the responsibility of the data-base designer to choose the appropriate action and to specify it in the database schema. As a general rule, the \\nCASCADE  option is suitable for “relationship” rela-\\ntions (see Section 9.1) , such as WORKS_ON ; for relations that represent multival-\\nued attributes, such as DEPT_LOCATIONS ; and for relations that represent weak \\nentity types, such as DEPENDENT .\\n6.2.3 Giving Names to Constraints\\nFigure 6.2 also illustrates how a constraint may be given a constraint name , follow-\\ning the keyword CONSTRAINT . The names of all constraints within a particular \\nschema must be unique. A constraint name is used to identify a particular con-straint in case the constraint must be dropped later and replaced with another con-straint, as we discuss in Chapter 7. Giving names to constraints is optional. It is also possible to temporarily defer  a constraint until the end of a transaction, as we shall \\ndiscuss in Chapter 20 when we present transaction concepts.\\n6.2.4 Specifying Constraints on Tuples Using CHECK\\nIn addition to key and referential integrity constraints, which are specified by spe-cial keywords, other table constraints  can be specified through additional \\nCHECK \\nclauses at the end of a CREATE TABLE  statement. These can be called row-based  \\nconstraints because they apply to each row individually  and are checked whenever \\na row is inserted or modified. For example, suppose that the DEPARTMENT  table in \\nFigure 6.1 had an additional attribute Dept_create_date , which stores the date when \\nthe department was created. Then we could add the following CHECK  clause at the \\nend of the CREATE TABLE  statement for the DEPARTMENT  table to make sure that a \\nmanager’s start date is later than the department creation date.\\nCHECK  (Dept_create_date <= Mgr_start_date );\\nThe CHECK  clause can also be used to specify more general constraints using \\nthe CREATE ASSERTION  statement of SQL. We discuss this in Chapter 7 because \\nit requires the full power of queries, which are discussed in Sections 6.3  \\nand 7.1.\\n6.3 Basic Retrieval Queries in SQL\\nSQL has one basic statement for retrieving information from a database: the \\nSELECT  statement. The SELECT  statement is not the same as  the SELECT  operation \\nof relational algebra, which we shall discuss in Chapter 8. There are many options \\nand flavors to the SELECT  statement in SQL, so we will introduce its features grad-\\nually. We will use example queries specified on the schema of Figure 5.5 and will'),\n",

In this section, we present the features of SQL for simple retrieval \\nqueries . Features of SQL for specifying more complex retrieval queries are pre-\\nsented in Section 7.1.\\nBefore proceeding, we must point out an important distinction  between the practical \\nSQL model and the formal relational model discussed in Chapter 5: SQL allows a \\ntable (relation) to have two or more tuples that are identical in all their attribute \\nvalues. Hence, in general, an SQL  table is not a set of tuples , because a set does not \\nallow two identical members; rather, it is a multiset  (sometimes called a bag) of \\ntuples. Some SQL relations are constrained to be sets  because a key constraint has \\nbeen declared or because the DISTINCT  option has been used with the SELECT  state-\\nment (described later in this section). We should be aware of this distinction as we discuss the examples.\\n6.3.1  The SELECT-FROM-WHERE Structure  \\nof Basic SQL Queries\\nQueries in SQL can be very complex. We will start with simple queries, and then \\nprogress to more complex ones in a step-by-step manner. The basic form of the \\nSELECT  statement, sometimes called a mapping  or a select-from-where block , is \\nformed of the three clauses SELECT , FROM , and WHERE  and has the following form:9\\nSELECT  <attribute list>\\nFROM  <table list>\\nWHERE  <condition>;\\nwhere\\n ■<attribute list> is a list of attribute names whose values are to be retrieved by \\nthe query.\\n ■<table list> is a list of the relation names required to process the query.\\n ■<condition> is a conditional (Boolean) expression that identifies the tuples \\nto be retrieved by the query.\\nIn SQL, the basic logical comparison operators for comparing attribute values with \\none another and with literal constants are =, <, <=, >, >=, and <>. These correspond to the relational algebra operators =, <, ≤, >, ≥, and ≠, respectively, and to the C/C++ programming language operators =, <, <=, >, >=, and !=. The main syntactic difference is the not equal  operator. SQL has additional comparison operators that \\nwe will present gradually.\\nWe illustrate the basic \\nSELECT  statement in SQL with some sample queries. The \\nqueries are labeled here with the same query numbers used in Chapter 8 for easy cross-reference.\\n9The SELECT and FROM clauses are required in all SQL queries. The W HERE is optional (see Sec- \\ntion 6.3.3).'),\n",

Each tuple in the result will be a combination  of one project, one department (that controls the proj-\\nect), and one employee (that manages the department). The projection attributes are used to choose the attributes to be displayed from each combined tuple. The result of query \\nQ2 is shown in Figure 6.3(c).\\n6.3.2  Ambiguous Attribute Names, Aliasing,  \\nRenaming, and Tuple Variables\\nIn SQL, the same name can be used for two (or more) attributes as long as the \\nattributes are in different tables.  If this is the case, and a multitable query refers to \\ntwo or more attributes with the same name, we must  qualify  the attribute name \\nwith the relation name to prevent ambiguity. This is done by prefixing  the rela-\\ntion name to the attribute name and separating the two by a period. To illustrate this, suppose that in Figures 5.5 and 5.6 the \\nDno and Lname  attributes of the \\nEMPLOYEE  relation were called Dnumber  and Name , and the Dname  attribute of \\nDEPARTMENT  was also called Name ; then, to prevent ambiguity, query Q1 would \\nbe rephrased as shown in Q1A . We must prefix the attributes Name  and Dnumber  \\nin Q1A  to specify which ones we are referring to, because the same attribute \\nnames are used in both relations:\\nQ1A:  SELECT  Fname, EMPLOYEE.Name, Address\\n FROM  EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT\\n WHERE   DEPARTMENT.Name = ‘Research’  AND   \\nDEPARTMENT.Dnumber = EMPLOYEE.Dnumber;\\nFully qualified attribute names can be used for clarity even if there is no ambi-\\nguity in attribute names. Q1 can be rewritten as Q1′ below with fully qualified \\nattribute names. We can also rename the table names to shorter names by creat-\\ning an alias  for each table name to avoid repeated typing of long table names \\n(see Q8 below).\\nQ1′: SELECT   EMPLOYEE.Fname, EMPLOYEE.LName,  \\nEMPLOYEE.Address\\n FROM  EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT\\n WHERE   DEPARTMENT.DName = ‘Research’  AND   \\nDEPARTMENT.Dnumber = EMPLOYEE.Dno;\\nThe ambiguity of attribute names also arises in the case of queries that refer to the \\nsame relation twice, as in the following example.\\nQuery 8.  For each employee, retrieve the employee’s first and last name and the \\nfirst and last name of his or her immediate supervisor.\\nQ8: SELECT  E.Fname, E.Lname, S.Fname, S.Lname\\n FROM  EMPLOYEE AS E, EMPLOYEE AS S\\n WHERE  E.Super_ssn = S.Ssn;'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 222}, page_content='192 Chapter 6 Basic SQL\\nIn this case, we are required to declare alternative relation names E and S, called \\naliases  or tuple variables , for the EMPLOYEE  relation. An alias can follow the key-\\nword AS, as shown in Q8, or it can directly follow the relation name—for example, \\nby writing EMPLOYEE E , EMPLOYEE S  in the FROM  clause of Q8. It is also possible \\nto rename  the relation attributes within the query in SQL by giving them aliases. \\nFor example, if we write\\nEMPLOYEE AS E(Fn, Mi, Ln, Ssn, Bd, Addr, Sex, Sal, Sssn, Dno)\\nin the FROM  clause, Fn becomes an alias for Fname , Mi for Minit , Ln for Lname , and \\nso on.\\nIn Q8, we can think of E and S as two different copies  of the EMPLOYEE  relation; the \\nfirst, E, represents employees in the role of supervisees or subordinates; the second, \\nS, represents employees in the role of supervisors. We can now join the two copies. \\nOf course, in reality there is only one  EMPLOYEE  relation, and the join condition is \\nmeant to join the relation with itself by matching the tuples that satisfy the join condition \\nE.Super_ssn  = S.Ssn . Notice that this is an example of a one-level recur-\\nsive query, as we will discuss in Section 8.4.2. In earlier versions of SQL, it was not \\npossible to specify a general recursive query, with an unknown number of levels, in \\na single SQL statement. A construct for specifying recursive queries has been incor-\\nporated into SQL:1999 (see Chapter 7).\\nThe result of query Q8 is shown in Figure 6.3(d). Whenever one or more aliases \\nare given to a relation, we can use these names to represent different references \\nto that same relation. This permits multiple references to the same relation \\nwithin a query.\\nWe can use this alias-naming or renaming  mechanism in any SQL query to specify \\ntuple variables for every table in the WHERE  clause, whether or not the same rela-\\ntion needs to be referenced more than once. In fact, this practice is recommended \\nsince it results in queries that are easier to comprehend. For example, we could \\nspecify query Q1 as in Q1B :\\nQ1B:  SELECT  E.Fname, E.LName, E.Address\\n FROM  EMPLOYEE AS E, DEPARTMENT AS D\\n WHERE  D.DName = ‘Research’  AND  D.Dnumber = E.Dno;\\n6.3.3 Unspecified WHERE Clause and Use of the Asterisk\\nWe discuss two more features of SQL here. A missing  WHERE  clause indicates \\nno condition on tuple selection; hence, all tuples  of the relation specified in the \\nFROM  clause qualify and are selected for the query result. If more than one rela-\\ntion is specified in the FROM  clause and there is no WHERE  clause, then the \\nCROSS PRODUCT —all possible tuple combinations —of these relations is \\nselected. For example, Query 9 selects all EMPLOYEE  Ssns (Figure 6.3(e)), and \\nQuery 10 selects all combinations of an EMPLOYEE  Ssn and a DEPARTMENT  \\nDname , regardless of whether the employee works for the department or not \\n(Figure 6.3(f)).'),\n",

Notice that \\nQ10  is similar to a CROSS PRODUCT  operation followed by a \\nPROJECT  operation in relational algebra (see Chapter 8). If we specify all the attri-\\nbutes of EMPLOYEE  and DEPARTMENT  in Q10, we get the actual CROSS PRODUCT  \\n(except for duplicate elimination, if any).\\nTo retrieve all the attribute values of the selected tuples, we do not have to list the \\nattribute names explicitly in SQL; we just specify an asterisk  (*), which stands for all \\nthe attributes.  The * can also be prefixed by the relation name or alias; for example, \\nEMPLOYEE.* refers to all attributes of the EMPLOYEE table.\\nQuery Q1C  retrieves all the attribute values of any EMPLOYEE  who works in \\nDEPARTMENT  number 5 (Figure 6.3(g)), query Q1D  retrieves all the attributes of an \\nEMPLOYEE  and the attributes of the DEPARTMENT  in which he or she works for \\nevery employee of the ‘Research’ department, and Q10A  specifies the CROSS \\nPRODUCT of the EMPLOYEE  and DEPARTMENT  relations.\\nQ1C:  SELECT  *\\n FROM  EMPLOYEE\\n WHERE  Dno = 5;\\nQ1D:  SELECT  *\\n FROM  EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT\\n WHERE  Dname = ‘Research’  AND  Dno = Dnumber;\\nQ10A:  SELECT  *\\n FROM  EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT;\\n6.3.4 Tables as Sets in SQL\\nAs we mentioned earlier, SQL usually treats a table not as a set but rather as a multiset ; \\nduplicate tuples can appear more than once  in a table, and in the result of a query. \\nSQL does not automatically eliminate duplicate tuples in the results of queries, for \\nthe following reasons:\\n ■Duplicate elimination is an expensive operation. One way to implement it is \\nto sort the tuples first and then eliminate duplicates.\\n ■The user may want to see duplicate tuples in the result of a query.\\n ■When an aggregate function (see Section 7.1.7) is applied to tuples, in most \\ncases we do not want to eliminate duplicates.'),\n",

In general, a query with SELECT \\nDISTINCT  eliminates duplicates, whereas a query with SELECT ALL  does not. Speci-\\nfying SELECT  with neither ALL nor DISTINCT —as in our previous examples—is \\nequivalent to SELECT ALL . For example, Q11 retrieves the salary of every employee; \\nif several employees have the same salary, that salary value will appear as many times in the result of the query, as shown in Figure 6.4(a).

Applying the \\nUNION  operation to the two SELECT  queries gives the desired result.\\nSQL also has corresponding multiset operations, which are followed by the key-\\nword ALL (UNION ALL , EXCEPT ALL , INTERSECT ALL ). Their results are multisets \\n(duplicates are not eliminated). The behavior of these operations is illustrated by the examples in Figure 6.5. Basically, each tuple—whether it is a duplicate or not—is considered as a different tuple when applying these operations.\\n6.3.5 Substring Pattern Matching and Arithmetic Operators\\nIn this section we discuss several more features of SQL. The first feature allows comparison conditions on only parts of a character string, using the \\nLIKE  compari-\\nson operator. This can be used for string pattern matching . Partial strings are spec-\\nified using two reserved characters: % replaces an arbitrary number of zero or more characters, and the underscore (_) replaces a single character. For example, con-sider the following query.T (b)\\nA\\na1\\na1\\na2\\na2\\na2\\na3\\na4\\na5T (c)\\nA\\na2\\na3\\nT (d)\\nA\\na1\\na2R (a)\\nA\\na1\\na2\\na2\\na3S\\nA\\na1\\na2\\na4\\na5Figure 6.5 \\nThe results of SQL multiset operations.

Retrieve all employees whose address is in Houston, Texas.\\nQ12:  SELECT  Fname, Lname\\n FROM EMPLOYEE\\n WHERE  Address LIKE  ‘%Houston,TX%’;\\nTo retrieve all employees who were born during the 1970s, we can use Query Q12A . \\nHere, ‘7’ must be the third character of the string (according to our format for date), so we use the value ‘_ _ 5 _ _ _ _ _ _ _’, with each underscore serving as a place-holder for an arbitrary character.\\nQuery 12A.  Find all employees who were born during the 1950s.\\nQ12:  SELECT  Fname, Lname\\n FROM  EMPLOYEE\\n WHERE  Bdate LIKE  ‘_ _ 7 _ _ _ _ _ _ _’;\\nIf an underscore or % is needed as a literal character in the string, the character \\nshould be preceded by an escape character , which is specified after the string using \\nthe keyword ESCAPE . For example, ‘AB\\\\_CD\\\\%EF’ ESCAPE  ‘\\\\’ represents the lit-\\neral string ‘AB_CD%EF’ because \\\\ is specified as the escape character. Any charac-\\nter not used in the string can be chosen as the escape character. Also, we need a rule \\nto specify apostrophes or single quotation marks (‘ ’) if they are to be included in a \\nstring because they are used to begin and end strings. If an apostrophe (’) is needed, \\nit is represented as two consecutive apostrophes (”) so that it will not be interpreted \\nas ending the string. Notice that substring comparison implies that attribute values are not atomic (indivisible) values, as we had assumed in the formal relational model (see Section 5.1) .\\nAnother feature allows the use of arithmetic in queries. The standard arithmetic \\noperators for addition (+), subtraction (−), multiplication (*), and division (/) can \\nbe applied to numeric values or attributes with numeric domains. For example, \\nsuppose that we want to see the effect of giving all employees who work on the \\n‘ProductX’ project a 10% raise; we can issue Query 13 to see what their salaries would become. This example also shows how we can rename an attribute in the query result using \\nAS in the SELECT clause.\\nQuery 13.

For date, time, timestamp, and interval data types, operators include incrementing (+) or decrementing (−) a date, time, or timestamp by an interval. In addition, an interval value is the result of the difference between two date, time, or timestamp values. Another comparison operator, which can be used for convenience, is \\nBETWEEN , which is illustrated in Query 14.'),\n",

ORDER BY  specifies an order for displaying the results \\nof a query. Two additional clauses GROUP BY  and HAVING  will be described in \\nSection 7.1.8.\\nIn Chapter 7, we will present more complex features of SQL retrieval queries. These \\ninclude the following: nested queries that allow one query to be included as part of another query; aggregate functions that are used to provide summaries of the infor-mation in the tables; two additional clauses (\\nGROUP BY  and HAVING)  that can be \\nused to provide additional power to aggregate functions; and various types of joins that can combine records from various tables in different ways.\\n6.4  INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE  \\nStatements in SQL\\nIn SQL, three commands can be used to modify the database: INSERT , DELETE , and \\nUPDATE . We discuss each of these in turn.\\n6.4.1 The INSERT Command\\nIn its simplest form, INSERT  is used to add a single tuple (row) to a relation (table). \\nWe must specify the relation name and a list of values for the tuple. The values \\nshould be listed in the same order  in which the corresponding attributes were speci-\\nfied in the CREATE TABLE  command. For example, to add a new tuple to the \\nEMPLOYEE  relation shown in Figure 5.5 and specified in the CREATE TABLE \\nEMPLOYEE  … command in Figure 6.1, we can use U1:\\nU1: INSERT INTO  EMPLOYEE\\n VALUES   ( ‘Richard’, ‘K’, ‘Marini’, ‘653298653’, ‘1962-12-30’, ‘98  \\nOak Forest, Katy, TX’, ‘M’, 37000, ‘653298653’, 4 );\\nA second form of the INSERT  statement allows the user to specify explicit attribute \\nnames that correspond to the values provided in the INSERT  command. This is use-\\nful if a relation has many attributes but only a few of those attributes are assigned \\nvalues in the new tuple. However, the values must include all attributes with NOT \\nNULL  specification and no default value. Attributes with NULL  allowed or DEFAULT  \\nvalues are the ones that can be left out.  For example, to enter a tuple for a new \\nEMPLOYEE  for whom we know only the Fname , Lname , Dno, and Ssn attributes, we \\ncan use U1A:\\nU1A:  INSERT INTO  EMPLOYEE (Fname, Lname, Dno, Ssn)\\n VALUES  (‘Richard’, ‘Marini’, 4, ‘653298653’);\\nAttributes not specified in U1A are set to their DEFAULT  or to NULL , and the values \\nare listed in the same order as the attributes are listed in the INSERT  command itself. \\nIt is also possible to insert into a relation multiple tuples  separated by commas in a \\nsingle INSERT  command. The attribute values forming each tuple  are enclosed in \\nparentheses.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 229}, page_content='6.4 INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE Statements in SQL  199\\nA DBMS that fully implements SQL should support and enforce all the integrity \\nconstraints that can be specified in the DDL. For example, if we issue the command in \\nU2 on the database shown in Figure 5.6, the DBMS should reject  the operation \\nbecause no DEPARTMENT  tuple exists in the database with Dnumber  = 2. Similarly, \\nU2A would be rejected  because no Ssn value is provided and it is the primary key, \\nwhich cannot be NULL .\\nU2: INSERT INTO  EMPLOYEE (Fname, Lname, Ssn, Dno)\\n VALUES   (‘Robert’, ‘Hatcher’, ‘980760540’, 2);\\n ( U2 is rejected if referential integrity checking is provided by DBMS.)\\nU2A:  INSERT INTO  EMPLOYEE (Fname, Lname, Dno)\\n VALUES   (‘Robert’, ‘Hatcher’, 5);\\n ( U2A is rejected if NOT NULL  checking is provided by DBMS.)\\nA variation of the INSERT  command inserts multiple tuples into a relation in con-\\njunction with creating the relation and loading it with the result of a query.  For \\nexample, to create a temporary table that has the employee last name, project name, \\nand hours per week for each employee working on a project, we can write the state-ments in \\nU3A and U3B:\\nU3A:  CREATE TABLE  WORKS_ON_INFO\\n ( Emp_name  VARCHAR (15),\\n   Proj_name  VARCHAR (15),\\n   Hours_per_week DECIMAL (3,1) );\\nU3B:  INSERT INTO   WORKS_ON_INFO ( Emp_name, Proj_name, \\nHours_per_week )\\n SELECT   E.Lname, P.Pname, W.Hours\\n FROM   PROJECT P, WORKS_ON W, EMPLOYEE E\\n WHERE   P.Pnumber = W.Pno AND  W.Essn = E.Ssn;\\nA table WORKS_ON_INFO  is created by U3A and is loaded with the joined informa-\\ntion retrieved from the database by the query in U3B . We can now query  \\nWORKS_ON_INFO  as we would any other relation; when we do not need it anymore, \\nwe can remove it by using the DROP TABLE  command (see Chapter 7). Notice that \\nthe WORKS_ON_INFO  table may not be up to date; that is, if we update any of the \\nPROJECT ,WORKS_ON , or EMPLOYEE  relations after issuing U3B, the information \\nin WORKS_ON_INFO  may become outdated.  We have to create a view (see Chap- \\nter 7) to keep such a table up to date.\\nMost DBMSs have bulk loading  tools that allow a user to load formatted data from \\na file into a table without having to write a large number of INSERT commands. \\nThe user can also write a program to read each record in the file, format it as a row \\nin the table, and insert it using the looping constructs of a programming language \\n(see Chapters 10 and 11, where we discuss database programming techniques).\\nAnother variation for loading data is to create a new table TNEW that has the \\nsame attributes as an existing table T, and load some of the data currently in T \\ninto TNEW. The syntax for doing this uses the LIKE clause. For example, if we'),\n",

It includes a WHERE  \\nclause, similar to that used in an SQL query, to select the tuples to be deleted. Tuples are explicitly deleted from only one table at a time. However, the deletion may propagate to tuples in other relations if referential triggered actions  are spec-\\nified in the referential integrity constraints of the DDL (see Section 6.2.2).\\n12 \\nDepending on the number of tuples selected by the condition in the WHERE  \\nclause, zero, one, or several tuples can be deleted by a single DELETE  command. A \\nmissing WHERE  clause specifies that all tuples in the relation are to be deleted; \\nhowever, the table remains in the database as an empty table. We must use the \\nDROP TABLE  command to remove the table definition (see Chapter 7). The \\nDELETE  commands in U4A to U4D , if applied independently to the database state \\nshown in Figure 5.6, will delete zero, one, four, and all tuples, respectively, from the \\nEMPLOYEE  relation:\\nU4A:  DELETE FROM  EMPLOYEE \\n WHERE   Lname = ‘Brown’;\\nU4B:  DELETE FROM  EMPLOYEE \\n WHERE   Ssn = ‘123456789’;\\nU4C:  DELETE FROM  EMPLOYEE\\n WHERE   Dno = 5;\\nU4D:  DELETE FROM  EMPLOYEE;\\n6.4.3 The UPDATE Command\\nThe UPDATE  command is used to modify attribute values of one or more selected \\ntuples. As in the DELETE  command, a WHERE  clause in the UPDATE  command \\nselects the tuples to be modified from a single relation. However, updating a pri-mary key value may propagate to the foreign key values of tuples in other rela-tions if such a referential triggered action  is specified in the referential integrity \\n12Other actions can be automatically applied through triggers (see Section 26.1) and other mechanisms.'),\n",

An additional SET clause in the \\nUPDATE  command specifies the attributes to be modified and their new values. \\nFor example, to change the location and controlling department number of proj-ect number 10 to ‘Bellaire’ and 5, respectively, we use \\nU5:\\nU5: UPDATE  PROJECT\\n SET Plocation = ‘Bellaire’ , Dnum = 5\\n WHERE  Pnumber = 10;\\nSeveral tuples can be modified with a single UPDATE  command. An example is to \\ngive all employees in the ‘Research’ department a 10% raise in salary, as shown in \\nU6. In this request, the modified Salary  value depends on the original Salary  value \\nin each tuple, so two references to the Salary  attribute are needed. In the SET \\nclause, the reference to the Salary  attribute on the right refers to the old Salary  \\nvalue before modification , and the one on the left refers to the new Salary  value \\nafter modification :\\nU6: UPDATE  EMPLOYEE\\n SET Salary = Salary * 1.1\\n WHERE  Dno = 5;\\nIt is also possible to specify NULL  or DEFAULT  as the new attribute value. Notice that \\neach UPDATE  command explicitly refers to a single relation only. To modify multi-\\nple relations, we must issue several UPDATE  commands.\\n6.5 Additional Features of SQL\\nSQL has a number of additional features that we have not described in this chapter but that we discuss elsewhere in the book. These are as follows:\\n ■In Chapter 7, which is a continuation of this chapter, we will present the fol-\\nlowing SQL features: various techniques for specifying complex retrieval \\nqueries, including nested queries, aggregate functions, grouping, joined \\ntables, outer joins, case statements, and recursive queries; SQL views, trig-gers, and assertions; and commands for schema modification.\\n ■SQL has various techniques for writing programs in various programming \\nlanguages that include SQL statements to access one or more databases. \\nThese include embedded (and dynamic) SQL, SQL/CLI (Call Level Interface) \\nand its predecessor ODBC (Open Data Base Connectivity), and SQL/PSM (Persistent Stored Modules). We discuss these techniques in Chapter 10. We also describe how to access SQL databases through the Java programming language using JDBC and SQLJ.\\n ■Each commercial RDBMS will have, in addition to the SQL commands, a set \\nof commands for specifying physical database design parameters, file struc-\\ntures for relations, and access paths such as indexes. We called these com-\\nmands a storage definition language  (SDL ) in Chapter 2. Earlier versions of \\nSQL had commands for creating indexes , but these were removed from the'),\n",

Many sys-\\ntems still have the CREATE INDEX  commands; but they require a special \\nprivilege. We describe this in Chapter 17.\\n ■SQL has transaction control commands. These are used to specify units of \\ndatabase processing for concurrency control and recovery purposes. We discuss these commands in Chapter 20 after we discuss the concept of trans-actions in more detail.\\n ■SQL has language constructs for specifying the granting and revoking of \\nprivileges  to users. Privileges typically correspond to the right to use certain \\nSQL commands to access certain relations. Each relation is assigned an owner, and either the owner or the DBA staff can grant to selected users the privilege to use an SQL statement—such as \\nSELECT , INSERT , DELETE , or \\nUPDATE —to access the relation. In addition, the DBA staff can grant the \\nprivileges to create schemas, tables, or views to certain users. These SQL commands—called \\nGRANT  and REVOKE —are discussed in Chapter 20, \\nwhere we discuss database security and authorization.\\n ■SQL has language constructs for creating triggers. These are generally \\nreferred to as active database  techniques, since they specify actions that are \\nautomatically triggered by events such as database updates. We discuss these \\nfeatures in Section 26.1, where we discuss active database concepts.\\n ■SQL has incorporated many features from object-oriented models to have \\nmore powerful capabilities, leading to enhanced relational systems known \\nas object-relational . Capabilities such as creating complex-structured attri-\\nbutes, specifying abstract data types (called UDT s or user-defined types) for \\nattributes and tables, creating object identifiers  for referencing tuples, and \\nspecifying operations  on types are discussed in Chapter 12.\\n ■SQL and relational databases can interact with new technologies such as \\nXML (see Chapter 13) and OLAP/data warehouses (Chapter 29).\\n6.6 Summary\\nIn this chapter, we introduced the SQL database language. This language and its variations have been implemented as interfaces to many commercial relational \\nDBMSs, including Oracle’s Oracle; ibm’s DB2; Microsoft’s SQL Server; and many \\nother systems including Sybase and INGRES. Some open source systems also provide SQL, such as MySQL and PostgreSQL. The original version of SQL was imple-mented in the experimental DBMS called SYSTEM R, which was developed at IBM Research. SQL is designed to be a comprehensive language that includes statements for data definition, queries, updates, constraint specification, and view definition. We discussed the following features of SQL in this chapter: the data definition com-mands for creating tables, SQL basic data types, commands for constraint specifica-tion, simple retrieval queries, and database update commands. In the next chapter, we will present the following features of SQL: complex retrieval queries; views; trig-gers and assertions; and schema modification commands.'),\n",

Recall from Section 5.1.2 that \\nNULL  is used to represent a missing value, but that it usually has one of three differ-\\nent interpretations—value unknown  (value exists but is not known, or it is not \\nknown whether or not the value exists), value not available  (value exists but is pur-\\nposely withheld), or value not applicable  (the attribute does not apply to this tuple \\nor is undefined for this tuple). Consider the following examples to illustrate each of the meanings of \\nNULL .\\n  1. Unknown value.  A person’s date of birth is not known, so it is represented \\nby NULL  in the database. An example of the other case of unknown would be \\nNULL  for a person’s home phone because it is not known whether or not the \\nperson has a home phone.\\n  2. Unavailable or withheld value.  A person has a home phone but does not \\nwant it to be listed, so it is withheld and represented as NULL  in the database.\\n  3. Not applicable attribute.  An attribute LastCollegeDegree would be NULL  for a \\nperson who has no college degrees because it does not apply to that person.\\nIt is often not possible to determine which of the meanings is intended; for exam-\\nple, a NULL  for the home phone of a person can have any of the three meanings. \\nHence, SQL does not distinguish among the different meanings of NULL .\\nIn general, each individual NULL  value is considered to be different from every other \\nNULL  value in the various database records. When a record with NULL  in one of its \\nattributes is involved in a comparison operation, the result is considered to be \\nUNKNOWN  (it may be TRUE  or it may be FALSE ). Hence, SQL uses a three-valued \\nlogic with values TRUE , FALSE , and UNKNOWN  instead of the standard two-valued \\n(Boolean) logic with values TRUE  or FALSE . It is therefore necessary to define the \\nresults (or truth values) of three-valued logical expressions when the logical con-nectives \\nAND , OR, and NOT are used. Table 7.1 shows the resulting values.\\nTable 7.1 Logical Connectives in Three-Valued Logic\\n(a) AND TRUE FALSE UNKNOWN\\nTRUE TRUE FALSE UNKNOWN\\nFALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE\\nUNKNOWN UNKNOWN FALSE UNKNOWN\\n(b) OR TRUE FALSE UNKNOWN\\nTRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE\\nFALSE TRUE FALSE UNKNOWN\\nUNKNOWN TRUE UNKNOWN UNKNOWN\\n(c) NOT\\nTRUE FALSE\\nFALSE TRUEUNKNOWN UNKNOWN'),\n",

Each expression result would have a value of TRUE , FALSE , or \\nUNKNOWN . The result of combining the two values using the AND  logical connec-\\ntive is shown by the entries in Table 7.1(a). Table 7.1(b) shows the result of using the \\nOR logical connective. For example, the result of ( FALSE AND UNKNOWN ) is \\nFALSE , whereas the result of ( FALSE OR UNKNOWN ) is UNKNOWN . Table 7.1(c) \\nshows the result of the NOT  logical operation. Notice that in standard Boolean logic, \\nonly TRUE  or FALSE  values are permitted; there is no UNKNOWN  value.\\nIn select-project-join queries, the general rule is that only those combinations of \\ntuples that evaluate the logical expression in the WHERE  clause of the query to TRUE  \\nare selected. Tuple combinations that evaluate to FALSE  or UNKNOWN  are not \\nselected. However, there are exceptions to that rule for certain operations, such as outer joins, as we shall see in Section 7.1.6.\\nSQL allows queries that check whether an attribute value is \\nNULL . Rather than using  \\n= or <> to compare an attribute value to NULL , SQL uses the comparison operators IS or \\nIS NOT . This is because SQL considers each NULL  value as being distinct from every \\nother NULL  value, so equality comparison is not appropriate. It follows that when a join \\ncondition is specified, tuples with NULL  values for the join attributes are not included in \\nthe result (unless it is an OUTER JOIN ; see Section 7.1.6). Query 18 illustrates NULL  com-\\nparison by retrieving any employees who do not have a supervisor.\\nQuery 18.  Retrieve the names of all employees who do not have supervisors.\\nQ18:  SELECT  Fname, Lname\\n FROM  EMPLOYEE\\n WHERE  Super_ssn IS NULL;\\n7.1.2  Nested Queries, Tuples,  \\nand Set/Multiset Comparisons\\nSome queries require that existing values in the database be fetched and then used \\nin a comparison condition. Such queries can be conveniently formulated by using nested queries , which are complete select-from-where blocks within another SQL \\nquery. That other query is called the outer query . These nested queries can also \\nappear in the WHERE clause or the FROM clause or the SELECT clause or other SQL clauses as needed. Query 4 is formulated in \\nQ4 without a nested query, but it \\ncan be rephrased to use nested queries as shown in Q4A . Q4A  introduces the com-\\nparison operator IN, which compares a value v with a set (or multiset) of values V \\nand evaluates to TRUE  if v is one of the elements in V.\\nIn Q4A, the first nested query selects the project numbers of projects that have an \\nemployee with last name ‘Smith’ involved as manager, whereas the second nested query selects the project numbers of projects that have an employee with last name ‘Smith’ involved as worker. In the outer query, we use the \\nOR logical connective to retrieve a \\nPROJECT  tuple if the PNUMBER  value of that tuple is in the result of either nested query.'),\n",

In such cases, it is permissible to use = instead of IN for the \\ncomparison operator. In general, the nested query will return a table  (relation), \\nwhich is a set or multiset of tuples.\\nSQL allows the use of tuples  of values in comparisons by placing them within \\nparentheses. To illustrate this, consider the following query:\\nSELECT  DISTINCT  Essn\\nFROM  WORKS_ON\\nWHERE  ( Pno, Hours ) IN ( SELECT  Pno, Hours\\n    FROM  WORKS_ON\\n    WHERE  Essn = ‘123456789’ );\\nThis query will select the Essns  of all employees who work the same (project, hours) \\ncombination on some project that employee ‘John Smith’ (whose Ssn = ‘123456789’) \\nworks on. In this example, the IN operator compares the subtuple of values in paren-\\ntheses ( Pno, Hours ) within each tuple in WORKS_ON  with the set of type-compatible \\ntuples produced by the nested query.\\nIn addition to the IN operator, a number of other comparison operators can be used \\nto compare a single value v (typically an attribute name) to a set or multiset v (typi-\\ncally a nested query). The = ANY (or = SOME ) operator returns TRUE  if the value v \\nis equal to some value  in the set V and is hence equivalent to IN. The two keywords \\nANY and SOME  have the same effect. Other operators that can be combined with \\nANY (or SOME ) include >, >=, <, <=, and <>. The keyword ALL can also be com-\\nbined with each of these operators. For example, the comparison condition ( v > ALL V) \\nreturns TRUE  if the value v is greater than all the values in the set (or multiset) V.  \\nAn example is the following query, which returns the names of employees whose \\nsalary is greater than the salary of all the employees in department 5:\\nSELECT  Lname, Fname\\nFROM  EMPLOYEE\\nWHERE  Salary >  ALL ( SELECT  Salary\\n    FROM  EMPLOYEE\\n    WHERE  Dno = 5 );'),\n",

We can once again be faced \\nwith possible ambiguity among attribute names if attributes of the same name exist—one in a relation in the \\nFROM  clause of the outer query,  and another in a rela-\\ntion in the FROM  clause of the nested query.  The rule is that a reference to an \\nunqualified attribute  refers to the relation declared in the innermost nested query . \\nFor example, in the SELECT  clause and WHERE  clause of the first nested query of \\nQ4A , a reference to any unqualified attribute of the PROJECT  relation refers to the \\nPROJECT  relation specified in the FROM  clause of the nested query. To refer to an \\nattribute of the PROJECT  relation specified in the outer query, we specify and refer \\nto an alias  (tuple variable) for that relation. These rules are similar to scope rules for \\nprogram variables in most programming languages that allow nested procedures and functions. To illustrate the potential ambiguity of attribute names in nested queries, consider Query 16.\\nQuery 16.  Retrieve the name of each employee who has a dependent with the \\nsame first name and is the same sex as the employee.\\nQ16:  SELECT  E.Fname, E.Lname\\n FROM  EMPLOYEE  AS E\\n WHERE  E.Ssn  IN ( SELECT  D.Essn\\n     FROM  DEPENDENT  AS D\\n     WHERE  E.Fname = D.Dependent_name\\n    AND  E.Sex = D.Sex  );\\nIn the nested query of Q16, we must qualify E.Sex  because it refers to the Sex attri-\\nbute of EMPLOYEE  from the outer query, and DEPENDENT  also has an attribute \\ncalled Sex. If there were any unqualified references to Sex in the nested query, they \\nwould refer to the Sex attribute of DEPENDENT . However, we would not have to  \\nqualify the attributes Fname  and Ssn of EMPLOYEE  if they appeared in the nested \\nquery because the DEPENDENT  relation does not have attributes called Fname  and \\nSsn, so there is no ambiguity.\\nIt is generally advisable to create tuple variables (aliases) for all the tables referenced \\nin an SQL query  to avoid potential errors and ambiguities, as illustrated in Q16.\\n7.1.3 Correlated Nested Queries\\nWhenever a condition in the WHERE  clause of a nested query references some attri-\\nbute of a relation declared in the outer query, the two queries are said to be correlated . \\nWe can understand a correlated query better by considering that the nested query is \\nevaluated once for each tuple (or combination of tuples) in the outer query.  For \\nexample, we can think of Q16 as follows: For each  EMPLOYEE  tuple, evaluate the \\nnested query, which retrieves the Essn  values for all DEPENDENT  tuples with the \\nsame sex and name as that EMPLOYEE  tuple; if the Ssn value of the EMPLOYEE  tuple \\nis in the result of the nested query, then select that EMPLOYEE  tuple.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 242}, page_content='212 Chapter 7 More SQL: Complex Queries, Triggers, Views, and Schema Modification\\nIn general, a query written with nested select-from-where blocks and using the = or \\nIN comparison operators can always  be expressed as a single block query. For exam-\\nple, Q16 may be written as in Q16A :\\nQ16A:  SELECT  E.Fname , E.Lname\\n FROM  EMPLOYEE  AS E, DEPENDENT  AS D\\n WHERE  E.Ssn = D.Essn  AND  E.Sex = D.Sex\\n  AND  E.Fname = D.Dependent_name;\\n7.1.4 The EXISTS and UNIQUE Functions in SQL\\nEXISTS and UNIQUE are Boolean functions that return TRUE or FALSE; hence, they can be used in a WHERE clause condition. The \\nEXISTS  function in SQL is used \\nto check whether the result of a nested query is empty  (contains no tuples) or not. \\nThe result of EXISTS  is a Boolean value TRUE  if the nested query result contains at \\nleast one tuple, or FALSE  if the nested query result contains no tuples. We illustrate \\nthe use of EXISTS —and NOT EXISTS —with some examples. First, we formulate \\nQuery 16 in an alternative form that uses EXISTS  as in Q16B :\\nQ16B:  SELECT  E.Fname, E.Lname\\n FROM  EMPLOYEE  AS E \\n WHERE  EXISTS  ( SELECT  *\\n     FROM  DEPENDENT  AS D\\n     WHERE  E.Ssn = D.Essn  AND  E.Sex = D.Sex\\n    AND  E.Fname = D.Dependent_name);\\nEXISTS  and NOT EXISTS  are typically used in conjunction with a correlated  nested \\nquery. In Q16B , the nested query references the Ssn, Fname , and Sex attributes of \\nthe EMPLOYEE  relation from the outer query. We can think of Q16B  as follows: For \\neach EMPLOYEE  tuple, evaluate the nested query, which retrieves all DEPENDENT  \\ntuples with the same Essn , Sex, and Dependent_name  as the EMPLOYEE  tuple; if at \\nleast one tuple EXISTS  in the result of the nested query, then select that EMPLOYEE  \\ntuple. EXISTS (Q) returns TRUE  if there is at least one tuple  in the result of the nested \\nquery Q, and returns FALSE  otherwise. On the other hand, NOT EXISTS (Q) returns \\nTRUE  if there are no tuples  in the result of nested query Q, and returns FALSE  other-\\nwise. Next, we illustrate the use of NOT EXISTS .\\nQuery 6.  Retrieve the names of employees who have no dependents.\\nQ6: SELECT  Fname, Lname\\n FROM  EMPLOYEE\\n WHERE   NOT EXISTS  ( SELECT  *\\n     FROM  DEPENDENT\\n     WHERE  Ssn = Essn  );\\nIn Q6, the correlated nested query retrieves all DEPENDENT  tuples related to a \\nparticular EMPLOYEE  tuple. If none exist,  the EMPLOYEE  tuple is selected because \\nthe WHERE -clause condition will evaluate to TRUE  in this case. We can explain \\nQ6 as follows: For each  EMPLOYEE  tuple, the correlated nested query selects all'),\n",

Can you rewrite this query using only a single nested query or no nested queries?\\nThe query \\nQ3: Retrieve the name of each employee who works on  all the projects con-\\ntrolled by department number 5  can be written using EXISTS  and NOT EXISTS  in \\nSQL systems. We show two ways of specifying this query Q3 in SQL as Q3A  and \\nQ3B . This is an example of certain types of queries that require universal quantifica-\\ntion, as we will discuss in Section 8.6.7. One way to write this query is to use the \\nconstruct ( S2 EXCEPT  S1) as explained next, and checking whether the result is \\nempty.1 This option is shown as Q3A .\\nQ3A:  SELECT  Fname, Lname\\n FROM  EMPLOYEE\\n WHERE  NOT EXISTS  ( ( SELECT    Pnumber\\n        FROM    PROJECT\\n        WHERE    Dnum = 5)\\n        EXCEPT  ( SELECT  Pno\\n      FROM  WORKS_ON\\n      WHERE  Ssn = Essn)  );\\nIn Q3A , the first subquery (which is not correlated with the outer query) selects all \\nprojects controlled by department 5, and the second subquery (which is corre-\\nlated) selects all projects that the particular employee being considered works on. If the set difference of the first subquery result \\nMINUS  (EXCEPT ) the second sub-\\nquery result is empty, it means that the employee works on all the projects and is \\ntherefore selected.\\n1Recall that EXCEPT is the set difference operator. The keyword MINUS is also sometimes used, for \\nexample, in Oracle.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 244}, page_content='214 Chapter 7 More SQL: Complex Queries, Triggers, Views, and Schema Modification\\nThe second option is shown as Q3B . Notice that we need two-level nesting in Q3B  \\nand that this formulation is quite a bit more complex than Q3A .\\nQ3B:  SELECT  Lname, Fname\\n FROM  EMPLOYEE\\n WHERE  NOT EXISTS  ( SELECT    *\\n     FROM    WORKS_ON B\\n     WHERE  ( B.Pno  IN ( SELECT   Pnumber\\n       FROM  PROJECT\\n       WHERE  Dnum = 5 )\\n     AND\\n     NOT EXISTS   ( SELECT  *\\n       FROM  WORKS_ON C\\n       WHERE  C.Essn = Ssn\\n       AND  C.Pno = B.Pno  )));\\nIn Q3B , the outer nested query selects any WORKS_ON  (B) tuples whose Pno is of a \\nproject controlled by department 5, if there is not a WORKS_ON  (C) tuple with the \\nsame Pno and the same Ssn as that of the EMPLOYEE  tuple under consideration in \\nthe outer query. If no such tuple exists, we select the EMPLOYEE  tuple. The form of \\nQ3B  matches the following rephrasing of Query 3: Select each employee such that \\nthere does not exist a project controlled by department 5 that the employee does \\nnot work on. It corresponds to the way we will write this query in tuple relation \\ncalculus (see Section 8.6.7).\\nThere is another SQL function, UNIQUE (Q), which returns TRUE  if there are no \\nduplicate tuples in the result of query Q; otherwise, it returns FALSE . This can be \\nused to test whether the result of a nested query is a set (no duplicates) or a multiset \\n(duplicates exist).\\n7.1.5 Explicit Sets and Renaming in SQL\\nWe have seen several queries with a nested query in the WHERE  clause. It is also \\npossible to use an explicit set of values  in the WHERE  clause, rather than a nested \\nquery. Such a set is enclosed in parentheses in SQL.\\nQuery 17.  Retrieve the Social Security numbers of all employees who work on \\nproject numbers 1, 2, or 3.\\nQ17:  SELECT  DISTINCT  Essn\\n FROM  WORKS_ON\\n WHERE  Pno IN (1, 2, 3);\\nIn SQL, it is possible to rename  any attribute that appears in the result of a query \\nby adding the qualifier AS followed by the desired new name. Hence, the AS con-\\nstruct can be used to alias both attribute and relation names in general, and it can be used in appropriate parts of a query. For example, \\nQ8A  shows how query Q8 \\nfrom Section 4.3.2 can be slightly changed to retrieve the last name of each employee and his or her supervisor while renaming the resulting attribute names'),\n",

The new names will appear as column \\nheaders for the query result.\\nQ8A:  SELECT  E.Lname  AS Employee_name, S.Lname  AS Supervisor_name\\n FROM  EMPLOYEE  AS E, EMPLOYEE  AS S\\n WHERE  E.Super_ssn = S.Ssn;\\n7.1.6 Joined Tables in SQL and Outer Joins\\nThe concept of a joined table  (or joined relation ) was incorporated into SQL to \\npermit users to specify a table resulting from a join operation in the  FROM  clause  of \\na query. This construct may be easier to comprehend than mixing together all the select and join conditions in the \\nWHERE  clause. For example, consider query Q1, \\nwhich retrieves the name and address of every employee who works for the ‘Research’ department. It may be easier to specify the join of the \\nEMPLOYEE  and \\nDEPARTMENT relations in the WHERE clause, and then to select the desired tuples \\nand attributes. This can be written in SQL as in Q1A :\\nQ1A:  SELECT  Fname, Lname, Address\\n FROM  (EMPLOYEE  JOIN  DEPARTMENT  ON Dno = Dnumber)\\n WHERE  Dname = ‘Research’;\\nThe FROM  clause in Q1A  contains a single joined table.  The attributes of such a table \\nare all the attributes of the first table, EMPLOYEE , followed by all the attributes of \\nthe second table, DEPARTMENT . The concept of a joined table also allows the user to \\nspecify different types of join, such as NATURAL JOIN  and various types of OUTER \\nJOIN . In a NATURAL JOIN  on two relations R and S, no join condition is specified; an \\nimplicit EQUIJOIN  condition  for each pair of attributes with the same name  from R \\nand S is created. Each such pair of attributes is included only once  in the resulting \\nrelation (see Sections 8.3.2 and 8.4.4 for more details on the various types of join \\noperations in relational algebra).\\nIf the names of the join attributes are not the same in the base relations, it is possible \\nto rename the attributes so that they match, and then to apply NATURAL JOIN . In \\nthis case, the AS construct can be used to rename a relation and all its attributes in \\nthe FROM  clause. This is illustrated in Q1B , where the DEPARTMENT  relation is \\nrenamed as DEPT  and its attributes are renamed as Dname , Dno (to match the name \\nof the desired join attribute Dno in the EMPLOYEE  table), Mssn , and Msdate . The \\nimplied join condition for this NATURAL JOIN  is EMPLOYEE.Dno  = DEPT.Dno , \\nbecause this is the only pair of attributes with the same name after renaming:\\nQ1B:  SELECT  Fname, Lname, Address\\n FROM  (EMPLOYEE  NATURAL JOIN\\n  (DEPARTMENT  AS DEPT (Dname, Dno, Mssn, Msdate)))\\n WHERE  Dname = ‘Research’ ;\\nThe default type of join in a joined table is called an inner join , where a tuple is \\nincluded in the result only if a matching tuple exists in the other relation. For exam-\\nple, in query Q8A , only employees who have a supervisor  are included in the result;'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 246}, page_content='216 Chapter 7 More SQL: Complex Queries, Triggers, Views, and Schema Modification\\nan EMPLOYEE  tuple whose value for Super_ssn  is NULL  is excluded. If the user \\nrequires that all employees be included, a different type of join called OUTER JOIN  \\nmust be used explicitly (see Section 8.4.4 for the definition of OUTER JOIN in rela-\\ntional algebra ). There are several variations of OUTER JOIN, as we shall see. In the \\nSQL standard, this is handled by explicitly specifying the keyword OUTER JOIN  in a \\njoined table, as illustrated in Q8B :\\nQ8B:  SELECT  E.Lname  AS Employee_name,\\n  S.Lname  AS Supervisor_name\\n FROM  (EMPLOYEE  AS E LEFT OUTER JOIN  EMPLOYEE  AS S\\n  ON E.Super_ssn = S.Ssn);\\nIn SQL, the options available for specifying joined tables include INNER JOIN  (only \\npairs of tuples that match the join condition are retrieved, same as JOIN ), LEFT \\nOUTER JOIN  (every tuple in the left table must appear in the result; if it does not have \\na matching tuple, it is padded with NULL  values for the attributes of the right table), \\nRIGHT OUTER JOIN  (every tuple in the right table must appear in the result; if it does \\nnot have a matching tuple, it is padded with NULL  values for the attributes of the left \\ntable), and FULL OUTER JOIN . In the latter three options, the keyword OUTER  may be \\nomitted. If the join attributes have the same name, one can also specify the natural \\njoin variation of outer joins by using the keyword NATURAL  before the operation (for \\nexample, NATURAL LEFT OUTER JOIN ). The keyword CROSS JOIN  is used to specify \\nthe CARTESIAN PRODUCT  operation (see Section 8.2.2), although this should be \\nused only with the utmost care because it generates all possible tuple combinations.\\nIt is also possible to nest join specifications; that is, one of the tables in a join may \\nitself be a joined table. This allows the specification of the join of three or more tables as a single joined table, which is called a multiway join . For example, \\nQ2A  is a differ-\\nent way of specifying query Q2 from Section 6.3.1 using the concept of a joined table:\\nQ2A:  SELECT  Pnumber, Dnum, Lname, Address, Bdate\\n FROM  ( (PROJECT  JOIN  DEPARTMENT  ON Dnum = Dnumber)\\n  JOIN  EMPLOYEE  ON Mgr_ssn = Ssn)\\n WHERE  Plocation = ‘Stafford’ ;\\nNot all SQL implementations have implemented the new syntax of joined tables. In some systems, a different syntax was used to specify outer joins by using the compari-son operators + =, = +, and + = + for left, right, and full outer join, respectively, when specifying the join condition. For example, this syntax is available in Oracle. To specify the left outer join in \\nQ8B  using this syntax, we could write the query Q8C  as follows:\\nQ8C:  SELECT  E.Lname, S.Lname\\n FROM  EMPLOYEE E, EMPLOYEE S\\n WHERE  E.Super_ssn + = S.Ssn;\\n7.1.7 Aggregate Functions in SQL\\nAggregate functions  are used to summarize information from multiple tuples \\ninto a single-tuple summary.

A number \\nof built-in aggregate functions exist: COUNT , SUM , MAX , MIN, and AVG .2 The \\nCOUNT  function returns the number of tuples or values  as specified in a query. \\nThe functions SUM , MAX , MIN, and AVG  can be applied to a set or multiset of \\nnumeric values and return, respectively, the sum, maximum value, minimum value, and average (mean) of those values. These functions can be used in the \\nSELECT  clause or in a HAVING  clause (which we introduce later). The functions \\nMAX  and MIN can also be used with attributes that have nonnumeric domains if \\nthe domain values have a total ordering  among one another.3 We illustrate the use \\nof these functions with several queries.\\nQuery 19.  Find the sum of the salaries of all employees, the maximum salary, \\nthe minimum salary, and the average salary.\\nQ19:  SELECT  SUM  (Salary) , MAX  (Salary),  MIN (Salary),  AVG  (Salary)\\n FROM  EMPLOYEE;\\nThis query returns a single-row  summary of all the rows in the EMPLOYEE table. \\nWe could use AS to rename the column names in the resulting single-row table; for \\nexample, as in Q19A.\\nQ19A:  SELECT  SUM  (Salary)  AS Total_Sal,  MAX  (Salary)  AS Highest_Sal,\\n  MIN (Salary)  AS Lowest_Sal,  AVG  (Salary)  AS Average_Sal\\n FROM  EMPLOYEE;\\nIf we want to get the preceding aggregate function values for employees of a specific \\ndepartment—say, the ‘Research’ department—we can write Query 20, where the \\nEMPLOYEE  tuples are restricted by the WHERE  clause to those employees who work \\nfor the ‘Research’ department.\\nQuery 20.

We may also use the COUNT  function to count val-\\nues in a column rather than tuples, as in the next example.\\nQuery 23.  Count the number of distinct salary values in the database.\\nQ23:  SELECT  COUNT  (DISTINCT  Salary)\\n FROM  EMPLOYEE;\\nIf we write COUNT (SALARY ) instead of COUNT (DISTINCT SALARY ) in Q23 , then \\nduplicate values will not be eliminated. However, any tuples with NULL  for SALARY  \\nwill not be counted. In general, NULL  values are discarded  when aggregate func-\\ntions are applied to a particular column (attribute); the only exception is for COUNT(*) because tuples instead of values are counted. In the previous examples, any Salary values that are NULL are not included in the aggregate function calcula-tion. The general rule is as follows: when an aggregate function is applied to a col-lection of values, NULLs are removed from the collection before the calculation; if the collection becomes empty because all values are NULL, the aggregate function will return NULL (except in the case of COUNT, where it will return 0 for an empty collection of values).\\nThe preceding examples summarize a whole relation  (\\nQ19, Q21, Q23) or a selected \\nsubset of tuples ( Q20 , Q22 ), and hence all produce a table with a single row or a \\nsingle value. They illustrate how functions are applied to retrieve a summary value \\nor summary tuple from a table. These functions can also be used in selection condi-\\ntions involving nested queries. We can specify a correlated nested query with an \\naggregate function, and then use the nested query in the WHERE  clause of an outer \\nquery. For example, to retrieve the names of all employees who have two or more \\ndependents (Query 5), we can write the following:\\nQ5: SELECT  Lname, Fname  \\n FROM  EMPLOYEE\\n WHERE  ( SELECT  COUNT  (*)\\n    FROM   DEPENDENT\\n    WHERE  Ssn = Essn  ) > =  2;\\nThe correlated nested query counts the number of dependents that each employee \\nhas; if this is greater than or equal to two, the employee tuple is selected.\\nSQL also has aggregate functions SOME and ALL that can be applied to a col-\\nlection of Boolean values; SOME returns TRUE if at least one element in the collection is TRUE, whereas ALL returns TRUE if all elements in the collection are TRUE.\\n7.1.8 Grouping: The GROUP BY and HAVING Clauses\\nIn many cases we want to apply the aggregate functions to subgroups of tuples in a \\nrelation,  where the subgroups are based on some attribute values. For example, we \\nmay want to find the average salary of employees in each department  or the number'),\n",

In these cases we need to partition  the rela-\\ntion into nonoverlapping subsets (or groups ) of tuples. Each group (partition) will \\nconsist of the tuples that have the same value of some attribute(s), called the  grouping attribute(s) . We can then apply the function to each such group indepen-\\ndently to produce summary information about each group. SQL has a \\nGROUP BY  \\nclause for this purpose. The GROUP BY  clause specifies the grouping attributes, \\nwhich should also appear in the  SELECT  clause,  so that the value resulting from \\napplying each aggregate function to a group of tuples appears along with the value of the grouping attribute(s).\\nQuery 24.  For each department, retrieve the department number, the number \\nof employees in the department, and their average salary.\\nQ24:  SELECT  Dno,  COUNT  (*), AVG  (Salary)\\n FROM  EMPLOYEE\\n GROUP BY  Dno;\\nIn Q24 , the EMPLOYEE  tuples are partitioned into groups—each group having \\nthe same value for the GROUP BY attribute Dno. Hence, each group contains the \\nemployees who work in the same department. The COUNT  and AVG  functions \\nare applied to each such group of tuples. Notice that the SELECT  clause includes \\nonly the grouping attribute and the aggregate functions to be applied on each \\ngroup of tuples. Figure 7.1(a) illustrates how grouping works and shows the \\nresult of Q24 .\\nIf NULL s exist in the grouping attribute, then a separate group  is created for all \\ntuples with a NULL  value in the grouping attribute.  For example, if the EMPLOYEE  \\ntable had some tuples that had NULL  for the grouping attribute Dno, there would be \\na separate group for those tuples in the result of Q24.\\nQuery 25.  For each project, retrieve the project number, the project name, and \\nthe number of employees who work on that project.\\nQ25:  SELECT  Pnumber, Pname,  COUNT  (*)\\n FROM  PROJECT, WORKS_ON\\n WHERE  Pnumber = Pno\\n GROUP BY  Pnumber, Pname;\\nQ25 shows how we can use a join condition in conjunction with GROUP BY . In this \\ncase, the grouping and functions are applied after  the joining of the two relations in \\nthe WHERE clause.\\nSometimes we want to retrieve the values of these functions only for groups that \\nsatisfy certain conditions.  For example, suppose that we want to modify Query 25 so \\nthat only projects with more than two employees appear in the result. SQL provides \\na HAVING  clause, which can appear in conjunction with a GROUP BY  clause, for this \\npurpose. HAVING  provides a condition on the summary information regarding the \\ngroup of tuples associated with each value of the grouping attributes. Only the \\ngroups that satisfy the condition are retrieved in the result of the query. This is illus-\\ntrated by Query 26.'),\n",

The WITH clause \\nallows a user to define a table that will only be used in a particular query; it is some-what similar to creating a view (see Section 7.3) that will be used only in one query and then dropped. This construct was introduced as a convenience in SQL:99 and may not be available in all SQL based DBMSs. Queries using WITH can generally be written using other SQL constructs. For example, we can rewrite Q28 as Q28 ′:\\nQ28′: WITH    BIGDEPTS (Dno)  AS\\n  ( SELECT    Dno\\n    FROM    EMPLOYEE\\n    GROUP BY    Dno\\n    HAVING    COUNT  (*) > 5)\\n SELECT    Dno,  COUNT  (*)\\n FROM    EMPLOYEE\\n WHERE    Salary>40000  AND  Dno IN BIGDEPTS\\n GROUP BY    Dno;\\nIn Q28 ′, we defined in the WITH clause a temporary table BIG_DEPTS whose \\nresult holds the Dno’s of departments with more than five employees, then used \\nthis table in the subsequent query. Once this query is executed, the temporary table \\nBIGDEPTS is discarded.\\nSQL also has a CASE construct, which can be used when a value can be different \\nbased on certain conditions. This can be used in any part of an SQL query where a \\nvalue is expected, including when querying, inserting or updating tuples. We illus-trate this with an example. Suppose we want to give employees different raise amounts depending on which department they work for; for example, employees in \\ndepartment 5 get a $2,000 raise, those in department 4 get $1,500 and those in department 1 get $3,000 (see Figure 5.6 for the employee tuples). Then we could re-write the update operation U6 from Section 6.4.3 as U6 ′:\\nU6′: UPDATE  EMPLOYEE\\n SET Salary  = \\n CASE  WHEN  Dno =  5 THEN  Salary + 2000\\n  WHEN  Dno =  4 THEN  Salary + 1500\\n  WHEN  Dno =  1 THEN  Salary + 3000\\n  ELSE  Salary + 0 ;'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 253}, page_content='7.1 More Complex SQL Retrieval Queries  223\\nIn U6 ′, the salary raise value is determined through the CASE construct based on \\nthe department number for which each employee works. The CASE construct can also be used when inserting tuples that can have different attributes being NULL depending on the type of record being inserted into a table, as when a specialization (see Chapter 4) is mapped into a single table (see Chapter 9) or when a union type is mapped into relations.\\n7.1.10 Recursive Queries in SQL\\nIn this section, we illustrate how to write a recursive query in SQL. This syntax was added in SQL:99 to allow users the capability to specify a recursive query in a declarative manner. An example of a recursive relationship  between tuples of the \\nsame type is the relationship between an employee and a supervisor. This relation-ship is described by the foreign key \\nSuper_ssn  of the EMPLOYEE  relation in Fig- \\nures 5.5 and 5.6, and it relates each employee tuple (in the role of supervisee) to another employee tuple (in the role of supervisor). An example of a recursive oper-ation is to retrieve all supervisees of a supervisory employee e at all levels—that is, \\nall employees e′ directly supervised by e, all employees e′ directly supervised by each \\nemployee e′, all employees e″′ directly supervised by each employee e″, and so on. \\nIn SQL:99, this query can be written as follows:\\nQ29:    WITH RECURSIVE  SUP_EMP (SupSsn, EmpSsn)  AS\\n    ( SELECT  SupervisorSsn, Ssn\\n      FROM  EMPLOYEE\\n      UNION\\n      SELECT  E.Ssn, S.SupSsn\\n      FROM  EMPLOYEE  AS E, SUP_EMP  AS S\\n      WHERE  E.SupervisorSsn = S.EmpSsn)\\n   SELECT *\\n   FROM  SUP_EMP;\\nIn Q29, we are defining a view SUP_EMP that will hold the result of the recursive \\nquery. The view is initially empty. It is first loaded with the first level (supervisor, supervisee) Ssn combinations via the first part ( SELECT  SupervisorSss, Ssn FROM  \\nEMPLOYEE), which is called the base query . This will be combined via UNION \\nwith each successive level of supervisees through the second part, where the view contents are joined again with the base values to get the second level combinations, which are UNIONed with the first level. This is repeated with successive levels until a fixed point  is reached, where no more tuples are added to the view. At this point, \\nthe result of the recursive query is in the view SUP_EMP.\\n7.1.11 Discussion and Summary of SQL Queries\\nA retrieval query in SQL can consist of up to six clauses, but only the first two—\\nSELECT  and FROM —are mandatory. The query can span several lines, and is \\nended by a semicolon. Query terms are separated by spaces, and parentheses can be used to group relevant parts of a query in the standard way. The clauses are'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 254}, page_content='224 Chapter 7 More SQL: Complex Queries, Triggers, Views, and Schema Modification\\nspecified in the following order, with the clauses between square brackets [ … ] \\nbeing optional:\\nSELECT  <attribute and function list>\\nFROM  <table list>\\n[ WHERE  <condition> ]\\n[ GROUP BY  <grouping attribute(s)> ]\\n[ HAVING  <group condition> ]\\n[ ORDER BY  <attribute list> ];\\nThe SELECT  clause lists the attributes or functions to be retrieved. The FROM  clause \\nspecifies all relations (tables) needed in the query, including joined relations, but not those in nested queries. The \\nWHERE  clause specifies the conditions for selecting \\nthe tuples from these relations, including join conditions if needed. GROUP BY  \\nspecifies grouping attributes, whereas HAVING  specifies a condition on the groups \\nbeing selected rather than on the individual tuples. The built-in aggregate functions \\nCOUNT , SUM , MIN, MAX , and AVG  are used in conjunction with grouping, but they \\ncan also be applied to all the selected tuples in a query without a GROUP BY  clause. \\nFinally, ORDER BY  specifies an order for displaying the result of a query.\\nIn order to formulate queries correctly, it is useful to consider the steps that define \\nthe meaning  or semantics  of each query. A query is evaluated conceptually4 by first \\napplying the FROM  clause (to identify all tables involved in the query or to materialize \\nany joined tables), followed by the WHERE  clause to select and join tuples, and then by \\nGROUP BY  and HAVING . Conceptually, ORDER BY  is applied at the end to sort the query \\nresult. If none of the last three clauses ( GROUP BY , HAVING , and ORDER BY ) are speci-\\nfied, we can think conceptually  of a query as being executed as follows: For each combi-\\nnation of tuples —one from each of the relations specified in the FROM  clause—evaluate \\nthe WHERE  clause; if it evaluates to TRUE , place the values of the attributes specified in \\nthe SELECT  clause from this tuple combination in the result of the query. Of course, this \\nis not an efficient way to implement the query in a real system, and each DBMS has \\nspecial query optimization routines to decide on an execution plan that is efficient to \\nexecute. We discuss query processing and optimization in Chapters 18 and 19.\\nIn general, there are numerous ways to specify the same query in SQL. This flexibility \\nin specifying queries has advantages and disadvantages. The main advantage is that \\nusers can choose the technique with which they are most comfortable when specifying a query. For example, many queries may be specified with join conditions in the \\nWHERE  clause, or by using joined relations in the FROM  clause, or with some form of \\nnested queries and the IN comparison operator. Some users may be more comfortable \\nwith one approach, whereas others may be more comfortable with another. From the \\nprogrammer’s and the system’s point of view regarding query optimization, it is gener-\\nally preferable to write a query with as little nesting and implied ordering as possible.\\nThe disadvantage of having numerous ways of specifying the same query is that \\nthis may confuse the user, who may not know which technique to use to specify \\n4The actual order of query evaluation is implementation dependent; this is just a way to conceptually \\nview a query in order to correctly formulate it.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 255}, page_content='7.2 Specifying Constraints as Assertions and Actions as Triggers  225\\nparticular types of queries. Another problem is that it may be more efficient to \\nexecute a query specified in one way than the same query specified in an alterna-tive way. Ideally, this should not be the case: The DBMS should process the same query in the same way regardless of how the query is specified. But this is quite difficult in practice, since each DBMS has different methods for processing queries specified in different ways. Thus, an additional burden on the user is to determine which of the alternative specifications is the most efficient to execute. Ideally, the user should worry only about specifying the query correctly, whereas the DBMS would determine how to execute the query efficiently. In practice, however, it helps if the user is aware of which types of constructs in a query are more expen-sive to process than others.\\n7.2  Specifying Constraints as Assertions  \\nand Actions as Triggers\\nIn this section, we introduce two additional features of SQL: the CREATE ASSERTION  \\nstatement and the CREATE TRIGGER  statement. Section 7.2.1 discusses CREATE \\nASSERTION , which can be used to specify additional types of constraints that are \\noutside the scope of the built-in relational model constraints  (primary and unique \\nkeys, entity integrity, and referential integrity) that we presented in Section 5.2. These built-in constraints can be specified within the \\nCREATE TABLE  statement of \\nSQL (see Sections 6.1 and 6.2).\\nIn Section 7.2.2 we introduce CREATE TRIGGER , which can be used to specify auto-\\nmatic actions that the database system will perform when certain events and condi-tions occur. This type of functionality is generally referred to as active databases . \\nWe only introduce the basics of triggers  in this chapter, and present a more com-\\nplete discussion of active databases in Section 26.1.\\n7.2.1 Specifying General Constraints as Assertions in SQL\\nIn SQL, users can specify general constraints—those that do not fall into any of the categories described in Sections 6.1 and 6.2— via declarative assertions , using the \\nCREATE ASSERTION  statement. Each assertion is given a constraint name and is \\nspecified via a condition similar to the WHERE  clause of an SQL query. For exam-\\nple, to specify the constraint that the salary of an employee must not be greater than \\nthe salary of the manager of the department that the employee works for  in SQL, we \\ncan write the following assertion:\\nCREATE ASSERTION  SALARY_CONSTRAINT\\nCHECK  ( NOT EXISTS  ( SELECT  *\\n   FROM  EMPLOYEE E, EMPLOYEE M,\\n  DEPARTMENT D\\n   WHERE  E.Salary>M.Salary\\n  AND  E.Dno = D.Dnumber\\n  AND  D.Mgr_ssn = M.Ssn  ) );'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 256}, page_content='226 Chapter 7 More SQL: Complex Queries, Triggers, Views, and Schema Modification\\nThe constraint name SALARY_CONSTRAINT is followed by the keyword CHECK , \\nwhich is followed by a condition  in parentheses that must hold true on every data-\\nbase state for the assertion to be satisfied. The constraint name can be used later to disable the constraint or to modify or drop it. The DBMS is responsible for ensur-ing that the condition is not violated. Any \\nWHERE  clause condition can be used, \\nbut many constraints can be specified using the EXISTS  and NOT EXISTS  style of \\nSQL conditions. Whenever some tuples in the database cause the condition of an \\nASSERTION  statement to evaluate to FALSE , the constraint is violated . The con-\\nstraint is satisfied  by a database state if no combination of tuples  in that database \\nstate violates the constraint.\\nThe basic technique for writing such assertions is to specify a query that selects any \\ntuples that violate the desired condition . By including this query inside a NOT EXISTS  \\nclause, the assertion will specify that the result of this query must be empty so that the condition will always be \\nTRUE . Thus, the assertion is violated if the result of the \\nquery is not empty. In the preceding example, the query selects all employees whose salaries are greater than the salary of the manager of their department. If the result of the query is not empty, the assertion is violated.\\nNote that the \\nCHECK  clause and constraint condition can also be used to specify \\nconstraints on individual  attributes and domains (see Section 6.2.1) and on indi-\\nvidual  tuples (see Section 6.2.4). A major difference between CREATE  \\nASSERTION  and the individual domain constraints and tuple constraints is that \\nthe CHECK  clauses on individual attributes, domains, and tuples are checked in \\nSQL only when tuples are inserted or updated  in a specific table. Hence, con-\\nstraint checking can be implemented more efficiently by the DBMS in these \\ncases. The schema designer should use CHECK  on attributes, domains, and tuples \\nonly when he or she is sure that the constraint can only be violated by insertion or \\nupdating of tuples . On the other hand, the schema designer should use CREATE \\nASSERTION  only in cases where it is not possible to use CHECK  on attributes, \\ndomains, or tuples, so that simple checks are implemented more efficiently by \\nthe DBMS .\\n7.2.2 Introduction to Triggers in SQL\\nAnother important statement in SQL is CREATE TRIGGER . In many cases it is con-\\nvenient to specify the type of action to be taken when certain events occur and when certain conditions are satisfied. For example, it may be useful to specify a condition that, if violated, causes some user to be informed of the violation. A man-ager may want to be informed if an employee’s travel expenses exceed a certain limit by receiving a message whenever this occurs. The action that the DBMS must take in this case is to send an appropriate message to that user. The condition is thus used to monitor  the database. Other actions may be specified, such as execut-\\ning a specific stored procedure  or triggering other updates. The \\nCREATE TRIGGER  \\nstatement is used to implement such actions in SQL. We discuss triggers in detail in Section 26.1 when we describe active databases . Here we just give a simple example \\nof how triggers may be used.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 257}, page_content='7.2 Specifying Constraints as Assertions and Actions as Triggers  227\\nSuppose we want to check whenever an employee’s salary is greater than the salary \\nof his or her direct supervisor in the COMPANY  database (see Figures 5.5 and 5.6). \\nSeveral events can trigger this rule: inserting a new employee record, changing an employee’s salary, or changing an employee’s supervisor. Suppose that the action to take would be to call an external stored procedure \\nSALARY_VIOLATION ,5 which will \\nnotify the supervisor. The trigger could then be written as in R5 below. Here we are \\nusing the syntax of the Oracle database system.\\nR5: CREATE TRIGGER  SALARY_VIOLATION\\n BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE OF  SALARY, SUPERVISOR_SSN\\n  ON EMPLOYEE\\n FOR EACH ROW\\n  WHEN  ( NEW .SALARY >  ( SELECT  SALARY  FROM  EMPLOYEE\\n        WHERE  SSN =  NEW .SUPERVISOR_SSN ) )\\n        INFORM_SUPERVISOR( NEW .Supervisor_ssn,   \\n        NEW .Ssn );\\nThe trigger is given the name SALARY_VIOLATION , which can be used to remove or \\ndeactivate the trigger later. A typical trigger which is regarded as an ECA (Event, Condition, Action) rule has three components:\\n  1. The event(s) : These are usually database update operations that are explic-\\nitly applied to the database. In this example the events are: inserting a new \\nemployee record, changing an employee’s salary, or changing an employee’s \\nsupervisor. The person who writes the trigger must make sure that all pos-\\nsible events are accounted for. In some cases, it may be necessary to write more than one trigger to cover all possible cases. These events are specified after the keyword \\nBEFORE  in our example, which means that the trigger \\nshould be executed before the triggering operation is executed. An alterna-\\ntive is to use the keyword AFTER , which specifies that the trigger should be \\nexecuted after the operation specified in the event is completed.\\n  2. The condition  that determines whether the rule action should be executed: \\nOnce the triggering event has occurred, an optional  condition may be evalu-\\nated. If no condition  is specified, the action will be executed once the event \\noccurs. If a condition is specified, it is first evaluated, and only if it evaluates \\nto true  will the rule action be executed. The condition is specified in the \\nWHEN clause of the trigger.\\n  3. The action  to be taken: The action is usually a sequence of SQL statements, \\nbut it could also be a database transaction or an external program that will \\nbe automatically executed. In this example, the action is to execute the stored \\nprocedure INFORM_SUPERVISOR .\\nTriggers can be used in various applications, such as maintaining database consis-\\ntency, monitoring database updates, and updating derived data automatically. A \\ncomplete discussion is given in Section 26.1.\\n5Assuming that an appropriate external procedure has been declared. We discuss stored procedures in \\nChapter 10.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 258}, page_content='228 Chapter 7 More SQL: Complex Queries, Triggers, Views, and Schema Modification\\n7.3 Views (Virtual Tables) in SQL\\nIn this section we introduce the concept of a view in SQL. We show how views are \\nspecified, and then we discuss the problem of updating views and how views can be implemented by the DBMS.\\n7.3.1 Concept of a View in SQL\\nA view  in SQL terminology is a single table that is derived from other tables.6  These \\nother tables can be base tables  or previously defined views. A view does not neces-\\nsarily exist in physical form; it is considered to be a virtual table , in contrast to base \\ntables , whose tuples are always physically stored in the database. This limits the \\npossible update operations that can be applied to views, but it does not provide any \\nlimitations on querying a view.\\nWe can think of a view as a way of specifying a table that we need to reference \\nfrequently, even though it may not exist physically. For example, referring to the \\nCOMPANY  database in Figure 5.5, we may frequently issue queries that retrieve the \\nemployee name and the project names that the employee works on. Rather than having to specify the join of the three tables \\nEMPLOYEE , WORKS_ON , and PROJECT  \\nevery time we issue this query, we can define a view that is specified as the result of these joins. Then we can issue queries on the view, which are specified as single-table retrievals rather than as retrievals involving two joins on three tables. We call the \\nEMPLOYEE , WORKS_ON , and PROJECT  tables the defining tables  of the view.\\n7.3.2 Specification of Views in SQL\\nIn SQL, the command to specify a view is CREATE VIEW . The view is given a (vir-\\ntual) table name (or view name), a list of attribute names, and a query to specify the contents of the view. If none of the view attributes results from applying functions or arithmetic operations, we do not have to specify new attribute names for the view, since they would be the same as the names of the attributes of the defining tables in the default case. The views in \\nV1 and V2 create virtual tables whose sche-\\nmas are illustrated in Figure 7.2 when applied to the database schema of Figure 5.5.\\nV1: CREATE VIEW  WORKS_ON1\\n AS SELECT  Fname, Lname, Pname, Hours\\n    FROM  EMPLOYEE, PROJECT, WORKS_ON\\n    WHERE  Ssn = Essn  AND  Pno = Pnumber;\\nV2: CREATE VIEW  DEPT_INFO(Dept_name, No_of_emps, Total_sal)\\n AS SELECT  Dname,  COUNT  (*), SUM  (Salary)\\n    FROM  DEPARTMENT, EMPLOYEE\\n    WHERE  Dnumber = Dno\\n    GROUP BY  Dname;\\n6As used in SQL, the term view is more limited than the term user view  discussed in Chapters 1 and 2, \\nsince a user view would possibly include many relations.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 259}, page_content='7.3 Views (Virtual Tables) in SQL  229\\nIn V1, we did not specify any new attribute names for the view WORKS_ON1  \\n(although we could have); in this case, WORKS_ON1  inherits  the names of the \\nview attributes from the defining tables EMPLOYEE , PROJECT , and WORKS_ON . \\nView V2 explicitly specifies new attribute names for the view DEPT_INFO , using \\na one-to-one correspondence between the attributes specified in the CREATE \\nVIEW  clause and those specified in the SELECT  clause of the query that defines \\nthe view.\\nWe can now specify SQL queries on a view—or virtual table—in the same way we \\nspecify queries involving base tables. For example, to retrieve the last name and first name of all employees who work on the ‘ProductX’ project, we can utilize the \\nWORKS_ON1  view and specify the query as in QV1:\\nQV1:  SELECT  Fname, Lname\\n FROM  WORKS_ON1\\n WHERE  Pname = ‘ProductX’;\\nThe same query would require the specification of two joins if specified on the base \\nrelations directly; one of the main advantages of a view is to simplify the specifica-tion of certain queries. Views are also used as a security and authorization mecha-nism (see Section 7.3.4 and Chapter 30).\\nA view is supposed to be always up-to-date ; if we modify the tuples in the base \\ntables on which the view is defined, the view must automatically reflect these changes. Hence, the view does not have to be realized or materialized at the time of view definition  but rather at the time when we specify a query  on the view. It is the \\nresponsibility of the DBMS and not the user to make sure that the view is kept up-to-date. We will discuss various ways the DBMS can utilize to keep a view up-to-date in the next subsection.\\nIf we do not need a view anymore, we can use the \\nDROP VIEW  command to dispose \\nof it. For example, to get rid of the view V1, we can use the SQL statement in V1A:\\nV1A:  DROP VIEW  WORKS_ON1;\\n7.3.3 View Implementation, View Update, and Inline Views\\nThe problem of how a DBMS can efficiently implement a view for efficient querying is complex. Two main approaches have been suggested. One strategy, called query \\nmodification , involves modifying or transforming the view query (submitted by the DEPT_INFO\\nDept_name No_of_emps Total_salWORKS_ON1\\nFname Lname Pname Hours\\nFigure 7.2 \\nTwo views specified on the database schema of Figure 5.5.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 260}, page_content='230 Chapter 7 More SQL: Complex Queries, Triggers, Views, and Schema Modification\\nuser) into a query on the underlying base tables. For example, the query QV1 would \\nbe automatically modified to the following query by the DBMS:\\nSELECT  Fname, Lname\\nFROM  EMPLOYEE, PROJECT, WORKS_ON\\nWHERE  Ssn = Essn  AND  Pno = Pnumber\\n AND  Pname = ‘ProductX’ ;\\nThe disadvantage of this approach is that it is inefficient for views defined via com-\\nplex queries that are time-consuming to execute, especially if multiple view queries are going to be applied to the same view within a short period of time. The second strategy, called view materialization , involves physically creating a temporary or \\npermanent view table when the view is first queried or created and keeping that table on the assumption that other queries on the view will follow. In this case, an efficient strategy for automatically updating the view table when the base tables are updated must be developed in order to keep the view up-to-date. Techniques using the concept of incremental update  have been developed for this purpose, where \\nthe DBMS can determine what new tuples must be inserted, deleted, or modified in a materialized view table  when a database update is applied to one of the defining \\nbase tables . The view is generally kept as a materialized (physically stored) table as \\nlong as it is being queried. If the view is not queried for a certain period of time, the system may then automatically remove the physical table and recompute it from scratch when future queries reference the view.\\nDifferent strategies as to when a materialized view is updated are possible. The \\nimmediate update  strategy updates a view as soon as the base tables are changed; \\nthe lazy update  strategy updates the view when needed by a view query; and the \\nperiodic update  strategy updates the view periodically (in the latter strategy, a view \\nquery may get a result that is not up-to-date).\\nA user can always issue a retrieval query against any view. However, issuing an \\nINSERT, DELETE, or UPDATE command on a view table is in many cases not pos-sible. In general, an update on a view defined on a single table  without any aggregate \\nfunctions  can be mapped to an update on the underlying base table under certain \\nconditions. For a view involving joins, an update operation may be mapped to update operations on the underlying base relations in multiple ways . Hence, it is \\noften not possible for the DBMS to determine which of the updates is intended. To illustrate potential problems with updating a view defined on multiple tables, con-sider the \\nWORKS_ON1  view, and suppose that we issue the command to update the \\nPNAME  attribute of ‘John Smith’ from ‘ProductX’ to ‘ProductY’. This view update is \\nshown in UV1:\\nUV1:  UPDATE  WORKS_ON1\\n SET Pname = ‘ProductY’\\n WHERE  Lname = ‘Smith’ AND  Fname = ‘John’\\n  AND  Pname = ‘ProductX’ ;\\nThis query can be mapped into several updates on the base relations to give the desired update effect on the view. In addition, some of these updates will create'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 261}, page_content='7.3 Views (Virtual Tables) in SQL  231\\nadditional side effects that affect the result of other queries. For example, here are \\ntwo possible updates, (a) and (b), on the base relations corresponding to the view update operation in \\nUV1:\\n(a): UPDATE  WORKS_ON\\n SET Pno =  ( SELECT  Pnumber\\n     FROM  PROJECT\\n     WHERE  Pname = ‘ProductY’ )\\n WHERE  Essn  IN ( SELECT  Ssn\\n     FROM  EMPLOYEE\\n     WHERE  Lname = ‘Smith’ AND Fname  = ‘John’ )\\n  AND\\n  Pno =  ( SELECT  Pnumber\\n     FROM  PROJECT\\n     WHERE  Pname = ‘ProductX’ );\\n(b): UPDATE  PROJECT    SET  Pname =  ‘ProductY’\\n WHERE  Pname =  ‘ProductX’ ;\\nUpdate (a) relates ‘John Smith’ to the ‘ProductY’ PROJECT  tuple instead of the \\n‘ProductX’ PROJECT  tuple and is the most likely desired update. However, (b) would \\nalso give the desired update effect on the view, but it accomplishes this by changing \\nthe name of the ‘ProductX’ tuple in the PROJECT  relation to ‘ProductY’. It is quite \\nunlikely that the user who specified the view update UV1 wants the update to be \\ninterpreted as in (b), since it also has the side effect of changing all the view tuples \\nwith Pname  = ‘ProductX’.\\nSome view updates may not make much sense; for example, modifying the Total_sal  \\nattribute of the DEPT_INFO  view does not make sense because Total_sal  is defined to be \\nthe sum of the individual employee salaries. This incorrect request is shown as UV2:\\nUV2:  UPDATE   DEPT_INFO\\n SET Total_sal = 100000\\n WHERE  Dname = ‘Research’;\\nGenerally, a view update is feasible when only one possible update  on the base rela-\\ntions can accomplish the desired update operation on the view. Whenever an update on the view can be mapped to more than one update  on the underlying base \\nrelations, it is usually not permitted. Some researchers have suggested that the DBMS have a certain procedure for choosing one of the possible updates as the most likely one. Some researchers have developed methods for choosing the most \\nlikely update, whereas other researchers prefer to have the user choose the desired update mapping during view definition. But these options are generally not avail-able in most commercial DBMSs.\\nIn summary, we can make the following observations:\\n ■A view with a single defining table is updatable if the view attributes contain \\nthe primary key of the base relation, as well as all attributes with the NOT \\nNULL  constraint that do not have  default values specified.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 262}, page_content='232 Chapter 7 More SQL: Complex Queries, Triggers, Views, and Schema Modification\\n ■Views defined on multiple tables using joins are generally not updatable.\\n ■Views defined using grouping and aggregate functions are not updatable.\\nIn SQL, the clause WITH CHECK OPTION  should be added at the end of the view \\ndefinition if a view is to be updated  by INSERT, DELETE, or UPDATE statements. \\nThis allows the system to reject operations that violate the SQL rules for view updates. The full set of SQL rules for when a view may be modified by the user are more complex than the rules stated earlier.\\nIt is also possible to define a view table in the \\nFROM  clause  of an SQL query. This is \\nknown as an in-line view . In this case, the view is defined within the query itself.\\n7.3.4 Views as Authorization Mechanisms\\nWe describe SQL query authorization statements (GRANT and REVOKE) in detail \\nin Chapter 30, when we present database security and authorization mechanisms. Here, we will just give a couple of simple examples to illustrate how views can be used to hide certain attributes or tuples from unauthorized users. Suppose a certain user is only allowed to see employee information for employees who work for department 5; then we can create the following view DEPT5EMP and grant the user the privilege to query the view but not the base table EMPLOYEE itself. This user will only be able to retrieve employee information for employee tuples whose  Dno = 5, and will not be able to see other employee tuples when the view is queried.\\nCREATE VIEW  DEPT5EMP  AS\\nSELECT  *\\nFROM  EMPLOYEE\\nWHERE  Dno = 5;\\nIn a similar manner, a view can restrict a user to only see certain columns; for \\nexample, only the first name, last name, and address of an employee may be visible as follows:\\nCREATE VIEW  BASIC_EMP_DATA  AS\\nSELECT  Fname, Lname, Address\\nFROM  EMPLOYEE;\\nThus by creating an appropriate view and granting certain users access to the view \\nand not the base tables, they would be restricted to retrieving only the data specified in the view. Chapter 30 discusses security and authorization in detail, including the GRANT and REVOKE statements of SQL.\\n7.4 Schema Change Statements in SQL\\nIn this section, we give an overview of the schema evolution commands  available \\nin SQL, which can be used to alter a schema by adding or dropping tables, attri-\\nbutes, constraints, and other schema elements. This can be done while the database \\nis operational and does not require recompilation of the database schema. Certain'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 263}, page_content='7.4 Schema Change Statements in SQL  233\\nchecks must be done by the DBMS to ensure that the changes do not affect the rest \\nof the database and make it inconsistent.\\n7.4.1 The DROP Command\\nThe DROP  command can be used to drop named  schema elements, such as tables, \\ndomains, types, or constraints. One can also drop a whole schema if it is no longer needed by using the \\nDROP SCHEMA  command. There are two drop behavior  \\noptions: CASCADE  and RESTRICT . For example, to remove the COMPANY  database \\nschema and all its tables, domains, and other elements, the CASCADE  option is used \\nas follows:\\nDROP SCHEMA  COMPANY  CASCADE ;\\nIf the RESTRICT  option is chosen in place of CASCADE , the schema is dropped only \\nif it has no elements  in it; otherwise, the DROP  command will not be executed. To \\nuse the RESTRICT  option, the user must first individually drop each element in the \\nschema, then drop the schema itself.\\nIf a base relation within a schema is no longer needed, the relation and its definition \\ncan be deleted by using the DROP TABLE  command. For example, if we no longer \\nwish to keep track of dependents of employees in the COMPANY  database of Fig- \\nure 6.1, we can get rid of the DEPENDENT  relation by issuing the following command:\\nDROP TABLE  DEPENDENT  CASCADE ;\\nIf the RESTRICT  option is chosen instead of CASCADE , a table is dropped only if it is \\nnot referenced  in any constraints (for example, by foreign key definitions in another \\nrelation) or views (see Section 7.3) or by any other elements. With the CASCADE  \\noption, all such constraints, views, and other elements that reference the table being dropped are also dropped automatically from the schema, along with the table itself.\\nNotice that the \\nDROP TABLE  command not only deletes all the records in the table \\nif successful, but also removes the table definition  from the catalog. If it is desired to \\ndelete only the records but to leave the table definition for future use, then the \\nDELETE  command (see Section 6.4.2) should be used instead of DROP TABLE .\\nThe DROP  command can also be used to drop other types of named schema ele-\\nments, such as constraints or domains.\\n7.4.2 The ALTER Command\\nThe definition of a base table or of other named schema elements can be changed by using the \\nALTER  command. For base tables, the possible alter table actions  \\ninclude adding or dropping a column (attribute), changing a column definition, \\nand adding or dropping table constraints. For example, to add an attribute for \\nkeeping track of jobs of employees to the EMPLOYEE  base relation in the COMPANY  \\nschema (see Figure 6.1), we can use the command\\nALTER TABLE  COMPANY.EMPLOYEE  ADD COLUMN  Job VARCHAR(12);'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 264}, page_content='234 Chapter 7 More SQL: Complex Queries, Triggers, Views, and Schema Modification\\nWe must still enter a value for the new attribute Job for each individual EMPLOYEE  \\ntuple. This can be done either by specifying a default clause or by using the UPDATE  \\ncommand individually on each tuple (see Section 6.4.3). If no default clause is speci-fied, the new attribute will have \\nNULL s in all the tuples of the relation immediately after \\nthe command is executed; hence, the NOT NULL  constraint is not allowed  in this case.\\nTo drop a column, we must choose either CASCADE  or RESTRICT  for drop behav-\\nior. If CASCADE  is chosen, all constraints and views that reference the column are \\ndropped automatically from the schema, along with the column. If RESTRICT  is \\nchosen, the command is successful only if no views or constraints (or other schema elements) reference the column. For example, the following command removes the attribute \\nAddress  from the EMPLOYEE  base table:\\nALTER TABLE  COMPANY.EMPLOYEE  DROP COLUMN  Address  CASCADE ;\\nIt is also possible to alter a column definition by dropping an existing default clause \\nor by defining a new default clause. The following examples illustrate this clause:\\nALTER TABLE  COMPANY.DEPARTMENT  ALTER COLUMN  Mgr_ssn\\n  DROP DEFAULT ;\\nALTER TABLE  COMPANY.DEPARTMENT  ALTER COLUMN  Mgr_ssn\\n  SET DEFAULT  ‘333445555’ ;\\nOne can also change the constraints specified on a table by adding or dropping a named constraint. To be dropped, a constraint must have been given a name when \\nit was specified. For example, to drop the constraint named \\nEMPSUPERFK  in Fig-\\nure 6.2 from the EMPLOYEE  relation, we write:\\nALTER TABLE  COMPANY.EMPLOYEE\\nDROP CONSTRAINT  EMPSUPERFK  CASCADE ;\\nOnce this is done, we can redefine a replacement constraint by adding a new con-\\nstraint to the relation, if needed. This is specified by using the ADD CONSTRAINT  \\nkeyword in the ALTER TABLE  statement followed by the new constraint, which can \\nbe named or unnamed and can be of any of the table constraint types discussed.\\nThe preceding subsections gave an overview of the schema evolution commands of \\nSQL. It is also possible to create new tables and views within a database schema using the appropriate commands. There are many other details and options; we refer the interested reader to the SQL documents listed in the Selected Bibliography at the end of this chapter.\\n7.5 Summary\\nIn this chapter we presented additional features of the SQL database language. We \\nstarted in Section 7.1 by presenting more complex features of SQL retrieval queries, \\nincluding nested queries, joined tables, outer joins, aggregate functions, and group-\\ning.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 269}, page_content='2398\\nThe Relational Algebra and \\nRelational Calculus\\nIn this chapter we discuss the two formal languages  for \\nthe relational model: the relational algebra and the \\nrelational calculus. In contrast, Chapters 6 and 7 described the practical language  \\nfor the relational model, namely the SQL standard. Historically, the relational alge-bra and calculus were developed before the SQL language. SQL is primarily based on concepts from relational calculus and has been extended to incorporate some concepts from relational algebra as well. Because most relational DBMSs use SQL as their language, we presented the SQL language first.\\nRecall from Chapter 2 that a data model must include a set of operations to \\nmanipulate the database, in addition to the data model’s concepts for defining the database’s structure and constraints. We presented the structures and constraints of the formal relational model in Chapter 5. The basic set of operations for the formal relational model is the relational algebra . These operations enable a user \\nto specify basic retrieval requests as relational algebra expressions . The result of a \\nretrieval query is a new relation. The algebra operations thus produce new rela-tions, which can be further manipulated using operations of the same algebra. A sequence of relational algebra operations forms a relational algebra expression , \\nwhose result will also be a relation that represents the result of a database query (or retrieval request).\\nThe relational algebra is very important for several reasons. First, it provides a \\nformal foundation for relational model operations. Second, and perhaps more important, it is used as a basis for implementing and optimizing queries in the query processing and optimization modules that are integral parts of relational \\ndatabase management systems (RDBMSs), as we shall discuss in Chapters 18 and 19. Third, some of its concepts are incorporated into the SQL standard chapter 8'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 270}, page_content='240 Chapter 8 The Relational Algebra and Relational Calculus\\nquery language for RDBMSs. Although most commercial RDBMSs in use today \\ndo not provide user interfaces for relational algebra queries, the core operations and functions in the internal modules of most relational systems are based on relational algebra operations. We will define these operations in detail in Sec-tions 8.1 through 8.4 of this chapter.\\nWhereas the algebra defines a set of operations for the relational model, the  \\nrelational calculus  provides a higher-level declarative  language for specifying rela-\\ntional queries. In a relational calculus expression, there is no order of operations  to \\nspecify how to retrieve the query result—only what information the result should contain. This is the main distinguishing feature between relational algebra and rela-tional calculus. The relational calculus is important because it has a firm basis in mathematical logic and because the standard query language (SQL) for RDBMSs has some of its foundations in a variation of relational calculus known as the tuple relational calculus.\\n1\\nThe relational algebra is often considered to be an integral part of the relational data model. Its operations can be divided into two groups. One group includes set oper-ations from mathematical set theory; these are applicable because each relation is defined to be a set of tuples in the formal  relational model (see Section 5.1). Set \\noperations include \\nUNION , INTERSECTION , SET DIFFERENCE , and CARTESIAN \\nPRODUCT  (also known as CROSS PRODUCT ). The other group consists of opera-\\ntions developed specifically for relational databases—these include SELECT , \\nPROJECT , and JOIN , among others. First, we describe the SELECT  and PROJECT  \\noperations in Section 8.1 because they are unary operations  that operate on single \\nrelations. Then we discuss set operations in Section 8.2. In Section 8.3, we discuss \\nJOIN  and other complex binary operations , which operate on two tables by com-\\nbining related tuples (records) based on join conditions . The COMPANY  relational \\ndatabase shown in Figure 5.6 is used for our examples.\\nSome common database requests cannot be performed with the original relational \\nalgebra operations, so additional operations were created to express these requests. These include aggregate functions , which are operations that can summarize  data \\nfrom the tables, as well as additional types of \\nJOIN  and UNION  operations, known as \\nOUTER JOIN s and OUTER UNION s. These operations, which were added to the origi-\\nnal relational algebra because of their importance to many database applications, are described in Section 8.4. We give examples of specifying queries that use rela-tional operations in Section 8.5. Some of these same queries were used in Chap- ters 6 and 7. By using the same query numbers in this chapter, the reader can contrast how the same queries are written in the various query languages.\\nIn Sections 8.6 and 8.7 we describe the other main formal language for relational \\ndatabases, the relational calculus . There are two variations of relational calculus. \\nThe tuple  relational calculus is described in Section 8.6 and the domain  relational \\ncalculus is described in Section 8.7.

The relational calculus \\nis a formal language, based on the branch of mathematical logic called predicate calculus.\\n2 In tuple relational calculus, variables range over tuples , whereas in \\ndomain relational calculus, variables range over the domains  (values) of attributes. \\nIn Appendix C we give an overview of the Query-By-Example (QBE) language, which is a graphical user-friendly relational language based on domain relational calculus. Section 8.8 summarizes the chapter.\\nFor the reader who is interested in a less detailed introduction to formal relational \\nlanguages, Sections 8.4, 8.6, and 8.7 may be skipped.\\n8.1  Unary Relational Operations:  \\nSELECT and PROJECT\\n8.1.1 The SELECT Operation\\nThe SELECT  operation is used to choose a subset  of the tuples from a relation that \\nsatisfies a selection condition .3 We can consider the SELECT  operation to be a filter  \\nthat keeps only those tuples that satisfy a qualifying condition. Alternatively, we can \\nconsider the SELECT  operation to restrict  the tuples in a relation to only those tuples \\nthat satisfy the condition. The SELECT  operation can also be visualized as a horizon-\\ntal partition  of the relation into two sets of tuples—those tuples that satisfy the con-\\ndition and are selected, and those tuples that do not satisfy the condition and are \\nfiltered out. For example, to select the EMPLOYEE  tuples whose department is 4, or \\nthose whose salary is greater than $30,000, we can individually specify each of these \\ntwo conditions with a SELECT  operation as follows:\\nσDno=4(EMPLOYEE ) \\nσSalary >30000 (EMPLOYEE )\\nIn general, the SELECT  operation is denoted by\\nσ<selection condition >(R)\\nwhere the symbol σ (sigma) is used to denote the SELECT  operator and the selec-\\ntion condition is a Boolean expression (condition) specified on the attributes of \\nrelation R. Notice that R is generally a relational algebra expression  whose result is a \\nrelation—the simplest such expression is just the name of a database relation. The \\nrelation resulting from the SELECT  operation has the same attributes  as R.\\nThe Boolean expression specified in <selection condition> is made up of a number \\nof clauses  of the form\\n<attribute name> <comparison op> <constant value>\\n2In this chapter no familiarity with first-order predicate calculus—which deals with quantified variables \\nand values—is assumed.\\n3The SELECT operation is different  from the SELECT clause of SQL. The SELECT operation chooses \\ntuples from a table, and is sometimes called a RESTRICT or FIL TER operation.'),\n",

Clauses can be connected by the standard Boolean operators and, or, and not to form a general selection condition. For example, to \\nselect the tuples for all employees who either work in department 4 and make over \\n$25,000 per year, or work in department 5 and make over $30,000, we can specify \\nthe following \\nSELECT  operation:\\nσ(Dno=4 AND  Salary >25000 ) OR (Dno=5 AND  Salary >30000 )(EMPLOYEE )\\nThe result is shown in Figure 8.1(a).Notice that all the comparison operators in the set {=, <, ≤, >, ≥, ≠} can apply to \\nattributes whose domains are ordered values , such as numeric or date domains. \\nDomains of strings of characters are also considered to be ordered based on the col-lating sequence of the characters.

The \\n<selection condition> is applied independently to each individual tuple t  in R. This \\nis done by substituting each occurrence of an attribute Ai in the selection condition \\nwith its value in the tuple t[Ai]. If the condition evaluates to TRUE , then tuple t is \\nselected . All the selected tuples appear in the result of the SELECT  operation. The \\nBoolean conditions AND , OR, and NOT  have their normal interpretation, as follows:\\n ■(cond1 AND  cond2) is TRUE  if both (cond1) and (cond2) are TRUE ; other-\\nwise, it is FALSE .\\n ■(cond1 OR cond2) is TRUE  if either (cond1) or (cond2) or both are TRUE ; \\notherwise, it is FALSE .\\n ■(NOT  cond) is TRUE  if cond is FALSE ; otherwise, it is FALSE .\\nThe SELECT  operator is unary ; that is, it is applied to a single relation. Moreover, \\nthe selection operation is applied to each tuple individually ; hence, selection condi-\\ntions cannot involve more than one tuple. The degree  of the relation resulting from \\na SELECT  operation—its number of attributes—is the same as the degree of R. The \\nnumber of tuples in the resulting relation is always less than or equal to  the number \\nof tuples in R. That is, | σc (R)| ≤ | R| for any condition C. The fraction of tuples \\nselected by a selection condition is referred to as the selectivity  of the condition.\\nNotice that the SELECT  operation is commutative ; that is,\\nσ<cond1 >(σ<cond2 >(R)) = σ<cond2 >(σ<cond1 >(R))\\nHence, a sequence of SELECT s can be applied in any order. In addition, we can \\nalways combine a cascade  (or sequence ) of SELECT  operations into a single SELECT  \\noperation with a conjunctive ( AND ) condition; that is,\\nσ<cond1 >(σ<cond2 >(... (σ<cond n>(R)) ...)) = σ<cond1 > AND <cond2 > AND ...AND  <cond n>(R)\\nIn SQL, the SELECT  condition is typically specified in the WHERE  clause  of a query. \\nFor example, the following operation:\\nσDno=4 AND  Salary >25000  (EMPLOYEE )\\nwould correspond to the following SQL query:\\nSELECT  *\\nFROM  EMPLOYEE\\nWHERE  Dno=4 AND  Salary >25000 ;\\n8.1.2 The PROJECT Operation\\nIf we think of a relation as a table, the SELECT  operation chooses some of the rows  \\nfrom the table while discarding other rows. The PROJECT  operation, on the other \\nhand, selects certain columns  from the table and discards the other columns. If we \\nare interested in only certain attributes of a relation, we use the PROJECT  operation \\nto project  the relation over these attributes only. Therefore, the result of the PROJECT  \\noperation can be visualized as a vertical partition  of the relation into two relations:'),\n",

For example, to list each employee’s first and last name and salary, we can use the \\nPROJECT  operation as follows:\\nπLname, Fname, Salary (EMPLOYEE )\\nThe resulting relation is shown in Figure 8.1(b). The general form of the PROJECT  \\noperation is\\nπ<attribute list >(R)\\nwhere π (pi) is the symbol used to represent the PROJECT  operation, and <attribute \\nlist> is the desired sublist of attributes from the attributes of relation R. Again, \\nnotice that R is, in general, a relational algebra expression  whose result is a relation, \\nwhich in the simplest case is just the name of a database relation. The result of the \\nPROJECT  operation has only the attributes specified in <attribute list> in the same \\norder as they appear in the list . Hence, its degree  is equal to the number of attributes \\nin <attribute list>.\\nIf the attribute list includes only nonkey attributes of R, duplicate tuples are \\nlikely to occur. The PROJECT  operation removes any duplicate tuples , so the \\nresult of the PROJECT  operation is a set of distinct tuples, and hence a valid \\nrelation. This is known as duplicate elimination . For example, consider the \\nfollowing PROJECT  operation:\\nπSex, Salary (EMPLOYEE )\\nThe result is shown in Figure 8.1(c). Notice that the tuple <‘F’, 25000> appears only \\nonce in Figure 8.1(c), even though this combination of values appears twice in the \\nEMPLOYEE  relation. Duplicate elimination involves sorting or some other technique to \\ndetect duplicates and thus adds more processing. If duplicates are not eliminated, the result would be a multiset  or bag of tuples rather than a set. This was not permitted in \\nthe formal relational model but is allowed in SQL (see Section 6.3).\\nThe number of tuples in a relation resulting from a \\nPROJECT  operation is always \\nless than or equal to the number of tuples in R. If the projection list is a superkey of \\nR—that is, it includes some key of R—the resulting relation has the same number  of \\ntuples as R. Moreover,\\nπ<list1> (π<list2>(R)) = π<list1>(R)\\nas long as <list2> contains the attributes in <list1>; otherwise, the left-hand side is \\nan incorrect expression. It is also noteworthy that commutativity does not  hold \\non PROJECT .\\nIn SQL, the PROJECT  attribute list is specified in the SELECT  clause  of a query. For \\nexample, the following operation:\\nπSex, Salary (EMPLOYEE )\\nwould correspond to the following SQL query:\\nSELECT  DISTINCT  Sex, Salary\\nFROM  EMPLOYEE'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 275}, page_content='8.1 Unary Relational Operations: SELECT and PROJECT  245\\nNotice that if we remove the keyword DISTINCT  from this SQL query, then dupli-\\ncates will not be eliminated. This option is not available in the formal relational algebra, but the algebra can be extended to include this operation and allow rela-tions to be multisets; we do not discuss these extensions here.\\n8.1.3 Sequences of Operations and the RENAME Operation\\nThe relations shown in Figure 8.1 that depict operation results do not have any names. In general, for most queries, we need to apply several relational algebra operations one after the other. Either we can write the operations as a single  relational algebra expression  by nesting the operations, or we can apply one operation \\nat a time and create intermediate result relations. In the latter case, we must give names to the relations that hold the intermediate results. For example, to retrieve the first name, last name, and salary of all employees who work in department number 5, we must apply a \\nSELECT  and a PROJECT  operation. We can write a sin-\\ngle relational algebra expression, also known as an in-line expression , as follows:\\nπFname, Lname, Salary (σDno=5(EMPLOYEE ))\\nFigure 8.2(a) shows the result of this in-line relational algebra expression. Alterna-\\ntively, we can explicitly show the sequence of operations, giving a name to each intermediate relation, and using the assignment operation,  denoted by ← (left \\narrow), as follows:\\nDEP5_EMPS ← σDno=5(EMPLOYEE )\\nRESULT ← πFname, Lname, Salary (DEP5_EMPS )\\nIt is sometimes simpler to break down a complex sequence of operations by specify-\\ning intermediate result relations than to write a single relational algebra expression. We can also use this technique to rename  the attributes in the intermediate and \\nresult relations. This can be useful in connection with more complex operations \\nsuch as \\nUNION  and JOIN , as we shall see. To rename the attributes in a relation, we \\nsimply list the new attribute names in parentheses, as in the following example:\\nTEMP ← σDno=5(EMPLOYEE )\\nR(First_name, Last_name, Salary ) ← πFname, Lname, Salary (TEMP )\\nThese two operations are illustrated in Figure 8.2(b).If no renaming is applied, the names of the attributes in the resulting relation of a \\nSELECT  operation are the same as those in the original relation and in the same \\norder. For a PROJECT  operation with no renaming, the resulting relation has the \\nsame attribute names as those in the projection list and in the same order in which they appear in the list.\\nWe can also define a formal \\nRENAME  operation—which can rename either the rela-\\ntion name or the attribute names, or both—as a unary operator. The general \\nRENAME  operation when applied to a relation R of degree n is denoted by any of the \\nfollowing three forms:\\nρS(B1, B2, ... , Bn)(R)   or   ρS(R)   or   ρ(B1, B2, ... , Bn)(R)'),\n",

The first expression \\nrenames both the relation and its attributes, the second renames the relation only, and the third renames the attributes only. If the attributes of R are ( A\\n1, A2, … , An) \\nin that order, then each Ai is renamed as Bi.\\nIn SQL, a single query typically represents a complex relational algebra expression. \\nRenaming in SQL is accomplished by aliasing using AS, as in the following example:\\nSELECT  E.Fname AS First_name, E.Lname AS Last_name, E.Salary AS Salary\\nFROM  EMPLOYEE AS E\\nWHERE  E.Dno =5,\\n8.2  Relational Algebra Operations  \\nfrom Set Theory\\n8.2.1 The UNION, INTERSECTION, and MINUS Operations\\nThe next group of relational algebra operations are the standard mathematical \\noperations on sets.

In \\nits binary form, this set operation produces a new element by combining every \\nmember (tuple) from one relation (set) with every member (tuple) from the other \\nrelation (set).

Hence, if R has nR tuples (denoted as | R| = nR), and S has nS tuples, \\nthen R × S will have nR * nS tuples.\\nThe n-ary CARTESIAN PRODUCT  operation is an extension of the above concept, \\nwhich produces new tuples by concatenating all possible combinations of tuples \\nfrom n underlying relations. The CARTESIAN PRODUCT  operation applied by itself \\nis generally meaningless. It is mostly useful when followed by a selection that \\nmatches values of attributes coming from the component relations. For example, \\nsuppose that we want to retrieve a list of names of each female employee’s depen-dents.

We want to combine a female employee \\ntuple only with her particular dependents—namely, the DEPENDENT  tuples whose \\nEssn  value match the Ssn value of the EMPLOYEE  tuple. The ACTUAL_DEPENDENTS  \\nrelation accomplishes this. The EMP_DEPENDENTS  relation is a good example of \\nthe case where relational algebra can be correctly applied to yield results that make no sense at all. It is the responsibility of the user to make sure to apply only mean-ingful operations to relations.\\nThe \\nCARTESIAN PRODUCT  creates tuples with the combined attributes of two rela-\\ntions. We can SELECT  related tuples only  from the two relations by specifying an \\nappropriate selection condition after the Cartesian product, as we did in the pre-ceding example. Because this sequence of \\nCARTESIAN PRODUCT  followed by \\nSELECT  is quite commonly used to combine related tuples  from two relations, a \\nspecial operation, called JOIN , was created to specify this sequence as a single opera-\\ntion. We discuss the JOIN  operation next.\\nIn SQL, CARTESIAN PRODUCT  can be realized by using the CROSS JOIN  option in \\njoined tables (see Section 7.1.6). Alternatively, if there are two tables in the FROM  \\nclause and there is no corresponding join condition in the WHERE clause of the \\nSQL query, the result will also be the CARTESIAN PRODUCT  of the two tables (see \\nQ10 in Section 6.3.3).\\n8.3  Binary Relational Operations:  \\nJOIN and DIVISIO N\\n8.3.1 The JOIN Operation\\nThe JOIN  operation, denoted by , is used to combine related tuples  from two rela-\\ntions into single “longer” tuples. This operation is very important for any relational \\ndatabase with more than a single relation because it allows us to process relation-\\nships among relations. To illustrate JOIN , suppose that we want to retrieve the name \\nof the manager of each department. To get the manager’s name, we need to com-\\nbine each department tuple with the employee tuple whose Ssn value matches the \\nMgr_ssn  value in the department tuple. We do this by using the JOIN  operation and \\nthen projecting the result over the necessary attributes, as follows:\\nDEPT_MGR  ← DEPARTMENT   Mgr_ssn =Ssn EMPLOYEE  \\nRESULT  ← πDname, Lname, Fname (DEPT_MGR )\\nThe first operation is illustrated in Figure 8.6. Note that Mgr_ssn  is a foreign key of \\nthe DEPARTMENT  relation that references Ssn, the primary key of the EMPLOYEE  \\nrelation. This referential integrity constraint plays a role in having matching tuples in the referenced relation \\nEMPLOYEE .\\nThe JOIN  operation can be specified as a CARTESIAN PRODUCT  operation fol-\\nlowed by a SELECT  operation. However, JOIN  is very important because it is \\nused frequently when specifying database queries. Consider the earlier example'),\n",

This is \\nthe main difference between CARTESIAN PRODUCT  and JOIN . In JOIN , only combi-\\nnations of tuples satisfying the join condition  appear in the result, whereas in the \\nCARTESIAN PRODUCT  all combinations of tuples are included in the result. The \\njoin condition is specified on attributes from the two relations R and S and is \\nevaluated for each combination of tuples. Each tuple combination for which the \\njoin condition evaluates to TRUE  is included in the resulting relation Q as a single \\ncombined tuple .\\nA general join condition is of the form\\n<condition> AND  <condition> AND  … AND  <condition>\\nwhere each <condition> is of the form Ai θ Bj, Ai is an attribute of R, Bj is an attri-\\nbute of S, Ai and Bj have the same domain, and θ (theta) is one of the comparison \\noperators {=, <, ≤, >, ≥, ≠}. A JOIN  operation with such a general join condition is \\ncalled a THETA JOIN . Tuples whose join attributes are NULL  or for which the join \\ncondition is FALSE  do not  appear in the result.

Such a JOIN , where the only comparison operator used is =, is called an \\nEQUI JOIN . Both previous examples were EQUIJOINs . Notice that in the result of an \\nEQUIJOIN  we always have one or more pairs of attributes that have identical values  \\nin every tuple. For example, in Figure 8.6, the values of the attributes Mgr_ssn  and \\nSsn are identical in every tuple of DEPT_MGR  (the EQUIJOIN  result) because the \\nequality join condition specified on these two attributes requires the values to be \\nidentical  in every tuple in the result. Because one of each pair of attributes with \\nidentical values is superfluous, a new operation called NATURAL JOIN —denoted  \\nby *—was created to get rid of the second (superfluous) attribute in an EQUIJOIN  \\ncondition.6 The standard definition of NATURAL JOIN  requires that the two join \\nattributes (or each pair of join attributes) have the same name in both relations. If this is not the case, a renaming operation is applied first.\\nSuppose we want to combine each \\nPROJECT  tuple with the DEPARTMENT  tuple that \\ncontrols the project. In the following example, first we rename the Dnumber  attribute \\nof DEPARTMENT  to Dnum —so that it has the same name as the Dnum  attribute in \\nPROJECT —and then we apply NATURAL JOIN :\\nPROJ_DEPT  ← PROJECT  * ρ(Dname, Dnum, Mgr_ssn, Mgr_start_date )(DEPARTMENT )\\nThe same query can be done in two steps by creating an intermediate table DEPT  \\nas follows:\\nDEPT  ← ρ(Dname, Dnum, Mgr_ssn, Mgr_start_date )(DEPARTMENT ) \\nPROJ_DEPT  ← PROJECT  * DEPT\\nThe attribute Dnum  is called the join attribute  for the NATURAL JOIN  operation, \\nbecause it is the only attribute with the same name in both relations. The resulting relation is illustrated in Figure 8.7(a). In the \\nPROJ_DEPT  relation, each tuple combines \\na PROJECT  tuple with the DEPARTMENT  tuple for the department that controls the \\nproject, but only one join attribute value  is kept.\\nIf the attributes on which the natural join is specified already have the same names \\nin both relations , renaming is unnecessary. For example, to apply a natural join \\non the Dnumber  attributes of DEPARTMENT  and DEPT_LOCATIONS , it is sufficient \\nto write\\nDEPT_LOCS  ← DEPARTMENT  * DEPT_LOCATIONS\\nThe resulting relation is shown in Figure 8.7(b), which combines each department \\nwith its locations and has one tuple for each location. In general, the join condition for \\nNATURAL JOIN  is constructed by equating each pair of join attributes  that have \\nthe same name in the two relations and combining these conditions with AND . \\nThere can be a list of join attributes from each relation, and each corresponding pair must have the same name.\\n6NATURAL JOIN is basically an EQUIJOIN followed by the removal of the superfluous attributes.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 284}, page_content='254 Chapter 8 The Relational Algebra and Relational Calculus\\nNotice that if no combination of tuples satisfies the join condition, the result of a \\nJOIN  is an empty relation with zero tuples. In general, if R has nR tuples and S has \\nnS tuples, the result of a JOIN  operation R  <join condition>  S will have between zero \\nand nR * nS tuples. The expected size of the join result divided by the maximum \\nsize nR * nS leads to a ratio called join selectivity , which is a property of each join \\ncondition. If there is no join condition, all combinations of tuples qualify and the \\nJOIN  degenerates into a CARTESIAN PRODUCT , also called CROSS PRODUCT  or \\nCROSS JOIN .\\nAs we can see, a single JOIN  operation is used to combine data from two relations so \\nthat related information can be presented in a single table. These operations are also known as inner joins , to distinguish them from a different join variation called \\nouter joins  (see Section 8.4.4). Informally, an inner join  is a type of match-and-\\ncombine operation defined formally as a combination of \\nCARTESIAN PRODUCT  \\nand SELECTION . Note that sometimes a join may be specified between a relation \\nand itself, as we will illustrate in Section 8.4.3. The NATURAL JOIN  or EQUIJOIN  \\noperation can also be specified among multiple tables, leading to an n-way join .

The net result is a consolidated relation in which each tuple contains this project-department-manager combined information.\\nIn SQL, \\nJOIN  can be realized in several different ways. The first method is to specify \\nthe <join conditions> in the WHERE  clause, along with any other selection condi-\\ntions. This is very common and is illustrated by queries Q1, Q1A , Q1B , Q2, and Q8 \\nin Sections 6.3.1 and 6.3.2, as well as by many other query examples in Chapters 6 and 7. The second way is to use a nested relation, as illustrated by queries \\nQ4A  \\nand Q16  in Section 7.1.2. Another way is to use the concept of joined tables, as \\nillustrated by the queries Q1A , Q1B , Q8B , and Q2A  in Section 7.1.6. The construct \\nof joined tables was added to SQL2 to allow the user to specify explicitly all the various types of joins, because the other methods were more limited. It also allows the user to clearly distinguish join conditions from the selection conditions in the \\nWHERE  clause.\\n8.3.3 A Complete Set of Relational Algebra Operations\\nIt has been shown that the set of relational algebra operations { σ, π, ∪, ρ, –, ×} is a \\ncomplete  set; that is, any of the other original relational algebra operations can be \\nexpressed as a sequence of operations from this set . For example, the INTERSECTION  \\noperation can be expressed by using UNION  and MINUS  as follows:\\nR ∩ S ≡ (R ∪ S) – (( R – S) ∪ (S – R))\\nAlthough, strictly speaking, INTERSECTION  is not required, it is inconvenient to \\nspecify this complex expression every time we wish to specify an intersection. As another example, a \\nJOIN  operation can be specified as a CARTESIAN PRODUCT  fol-\\nlowed by a SELECT  operation, as we discussed:\\nR  <condition >S ≡ σ<condition >(R × S)\\nSimilarly, a NATURAL JOIN  can be specified as a CARTESIAN PRODUCT  preceded by \\nRENAME  and followed by SELECT  and PROJECT  operations. Hence, the various \\nJOIN  operations are also not strictly necessary  for the expressive power of the rela-\\ntional algebra. However, they are important to include as separate operations because they are convenient to use and are very commonly applied in database applications. Other operations have been included in the basic relational algebra for convenience rather than necessity. We discuss one of these—the \\nDIVISION  \\noperation—in the next section.\\n8.3.4 The DIVISION Operation\\nThe DIVISION  operation, denoted by ÷, is useful for a special kind of query that \\nsometimes occurs in database applications. An example is Retrieve the names of \\nemployees who work on  all the projects that ‘John Smith’ works on . To express \\nthis query using the DIVISION  operation, proceed as follows.

This means that, for a \\ntuple t to appear in the result T of the DIVISION , the values in t must appear in R in \\ncombination with every tuple  in S. Note that in the formulation of the DIVISION  \\noperation, the tuples in the denominator relation S restrict the numerator rela-\\ntion R by selecting those tuples in the result that match all values present in the \\ndenominator. It is not necessary to know what those values are as they can be computed by another operation, as illustrated in the \\nSMITH_PNOS  relation in \\nthe previous example.\\nFigure 8.8(b) illustrates a DIVISION  operation where X = {A}, Y = {B}, and Z = {A, B}. \\nNotice that the tuples (values) b1 and b4 appear in R in combination with all three \\ntuples in S; that is why they appear in the resulting relation T.

Table 8.1 lists the various \\nbasic relational algebra operations we have discussed.\\n8.3.5 Notation for Query Trees\\nIn this section we describe a notation typically used in relational DBMSs (RDBMSs) to represent queries internally. The notation is called a query tree  or sometimes it is \\nknown as a query evaluation tree  or query execution tree . It includes the relational \\nalgebra operations being executed and is used as a possible data structure for the internal representation of the query in an RDBMS.\\nA query tree  is a tree data structure that corresponds to a relational algebra expres-\\nsion. It represents the input relations of the query as leaf nodes  of the tree, and rep-\\nresents the relational algebra operations as internal nodes. An execution of the query tree consists of executing an internal node operation whenever its operands (represented by its child nodes) are available, and then replacing that internal node by the relation that results from executing the operation. The execution terminates when the root node is executed and produces the result relation for the query.\\nFigure 8.9 shows a query tree for Query 2 (see Section 6.3.1): For every project \\nlocated in ‘Stafford’, list the project number, the controlling department number, and the department manager’s last name, address, and birth date.  This query is specified'),\n",

We will revisit query trees when we discuss query processing and optimization in Chapters 18 and 19.\\n8.4 Additional Relational Operations\\nSome common database requests—which are needed in commercial applications \\nfor RDBMSs—cannot be performed with the original relational algebra operations described in Sections 8.1 through 8.3. In this section we define additional opera-tions to express these requests. These operations enhance the expressive power of the original relational algebra.\\n8.4.1 Generalized Projection\\nThe generalized projection operation extends the projection operation by allowing functions of attributes to be included in the projection list. The generalized form can be expressed as:\\nπ\\nF1, F2, ..., Fn  (R)\\nwhere F1, F2, … , Fn are functions over the attributes in relation R and may involve \\narithmetic operations and constant values. This operation is helpful when devel-oping reports where computed values have to be produced in the columns of a query result.Figure 8.9 \\nQuery tree corresponding to the relational algebra expression for Q2.(1)(2)(3)P.Pnumber,P.Dnum,E.Lname,E.Address,E.Bdateπ\\nD.Mgr_ssn=E.Ssn\\nP.Dnum=D.Dnumber\\nσP.Plocation= ‘Stafford’E\\nD\\nPEMPLOYEE\\nDEPART MENT\\nPROJECT'),\n",

Examples of such functions include retrieving the average or total salary of all employees or the total number of employee tuples. These functions are used in simple statistical queries that summarize information from the database tuples. Common functions applied to collections of numeric values include \\nSUM , \\nAVERAGE , MAXIMUM , and MINIMUM . The COUNT  function is used for counting \\ntuples or values.\\nAnother common type of request involves grouping the tuples in a relation by the \\nvalue of some of their attributes and then applying an aggregate function indepen-\\ndently to each group . An example would be to group EMPLOYEE  tuples by Dno, so \\nthat each group includes the tuples for employees working in the same department. We can then list each \\nDno value along with, say, the average salary of employees \\nwithin the department, or the number of employees who work in the department.\\nWe can define an AGGREGATE FUNCTION  operation, using the symbol I (pro-\\nnounced script F )7, to specify these types of requests as follows:\\n<grouping attributes>  ℑ <function list>  (R)\\nwhere <grouping attributes> is a list of attributes of the relation specified in R, and \\n<function list> is a list of (<function> <attribute>) pairs. In each such pair, <function> is one of the allowed functions—such as \\nSUM , AVERAGE , MAXIMUM , MINIMUM , \\nCOUNT —and <attribute> is an attribute of the relation specified by R. The resulting \\nrelation has the grouping attributes plus one attribute for each element in the function list. For example, to retrieve each department number, the number of employees in the department, and their average salary, while renaming the resulting attributes as indicated below, we write:\\nρ\\nR(Dno, No_of_employees, Average_sal ) (Dno ℑ COUNT Ssn, AVERAGE Salary  (EMPLOYEE ))\\n7There is no single agreed-upon notation for specifying aggregate functions. In some cases a “script A” \\nis used.'),\n",

If no renaming is applied, \\nthen the attributes of the resulting relation that correspond to the function list will \\neach be the concatenation of the function name with the attribute name in the form \\n<function>_<attribute>.8 For example, Figure 8.10(b) shows the result of the fol-\\nlowing operation:\\nDno ℑ COUNT Ssn, AVERAGE Salary (EMPLOYEE )\\nIf no grouping attributes are specified, the functions are applied to all the tuples   \\nin the relation, so the resulting relation has a single tuple only . For example, Fig- \\nure 8.10(c) shows the result of the following operation:\\nℑ COUNT Ssn , AVERAGE Salary (EMPLOYEE )\\nIt is important to note that, in general, duplicates are not eliminated  when an \\naggregate function is applied; this way, the normal interpretation of functions such as \\nSUM  and AVERAGE  is computed.9 However, NULL values are not considered in \\nthe aggregation, as we discussed in Section 7.1.7. It is worth emphasizing that the \\nresult of applying an aggregate function is a relation, not a scalar number—even \\nif it has a single value. This makes the relational algebra a closed mathematical \\nsystem.\\n8Note that this is an arbitrary notation, consistent with what SQL would do.\\n9In SQL, the option of eliminating duplicates before applying the aggregate function is available by \\nincluding the keyword DISTINCT (see Section Section 4.4.4).Count_ssn\\n8 35125Dno Count_ssn\\n5\\n4\\n14\\n3\\n133250\\n31000\\n55000Average_salary\\nAverage_salary(b)\\n(c)4\\n3\\n133250\\n31000\\n55000(a)Dno\\n5\\n4\\n1No_of_employees Average_salR\\nFigure 8.10 \\nThe aggregate function operation.\\na. ρR(Dno, No_of_employees, Average_sal) (Dno ℑ COUNT Ssn, AVERAGE Salary  (EMPLOYEE)).\\nb.

This operation is applied to a recursive  \\nrelationship  between tuples of the same type, such as the relationship between an \\nemployee and a supervisor. This relationship is described by the foreign key  \\nSuper_ssn  of the EMPLOYEE  relation in Figures 5.5 and 5.6, and it relates each \\nemployee tuple (in the role of supervisee) to another employee tuple (in the role of \\nsupervisor). An example of a recursive operation is to retrieve all supervisees of an employee e at all levels—that is, all employees e′ directly supervised by e, all employ-\\nees e′ℑ directly supervised by each employee e′, all employees e″′ directly super-\\nvised by each employee e″, and so on.\\nIt is relatively straightforward in the relational algebra to specify all employees \\nsupervised by e at a specific level  by joining the table with itself one or more \\ntimes. However, it is difficult to specify all supervisees at all levels. For example, \\nto specify the \\nSsns of all employees e′ directly supervised— at level one— by the \\nemployee e whose name is ‘James Borg’ (see Figure 5.6), we can apply the follow-\\ning operation:\\nBORG_SSN  ← πSsn(σFname =‘James’  AND  Lname =‘Borg’ (EMPLOYEE )) \\nSUPERVISION (Ssn1 , Ssn2 ) ← πSsn,Super_ssn (EMPLOYEE ) \\nRESULT1 (Ssn) ← πSsn1(SUPERVISION   Ssn2 =SsnBORG_SSN)\\nTo retrieve all employees supervised by Borg at level 2—that is, all employees e″ \\nsupervised by some employee e′ who is directly supervised by Borg—we can apply \\nanother JOIN  to the result of the first query, as follows:\\nRESULT2 (Ssn) ← πSsn1(SUPERVISION   Ssn2 =SsnRESULT1 )\\nTo get both sets of employees supervised at levels 1 and 2 by ‘James Borg’, we can \\napply the UNION operation to the two results, as follows:\\nRESULT  ← RESULT2  ∪ RESULT1\\nThe results of these queries are illustrated in Figure 8.11. Although it is possible to \\nretrieve employees at each level and then take their UNION , we cannot, in general, \\nspecify a query such as “retrieve the supervisees of ‘James Borg’ at all levels” without utilizing a looping mechanism unless we know the maximum number of levels.\\n10 \\nAn operation called the transitive closure  of relations has been proposed to com-\\npute the recursive relationship as far as the recursion proceeds.\\n8.4.4 OUTER JOIN Operations\\nNext, we discuss some additional extensions to the JOIN  operation that are nec-\\nessary to specify certain types of queries. The JOIN  operations described earlier \\nmatch tuples that satisfy the join condition. For example, for a NATURAL JOIN  \\n10The SQL3 standard includes syntax for recursive closure.'),\n",

Hence, tuples without a matching  (or related ) tuple \\nare eliminated from the JOIN  result. Tuples with NULL  values in the join attri-\\nbutes are also eliminated. This type of join, where tuples with no match are elim-inated, is known as an inner join . The join operations we described earlier in \\nSection 8.3 are all inner joins. This amounts to the loss of information if the user wants the result of the \\nJOIN  to include all the tuples in one or more of the com-\\nponent relations.\\nA set of operations, called outer joins , were developed for the case where the user \\nwants to keep all the tuples in R, or all those in S, or all those in both relations in \\nthe result of the JOIN , regardless of whether or not they have matching tuples in \\nthe other relation. This satisfies the need of queries in which tuples from two tables are to be combined by matching corresponding rows, but without losing any tuples for lack of matching values. For example, suppose that we want a list of all employee names as well as the name of the departments they manage if they \\nhappen to manage a department ; if they do not manage one, we can indicate it SUPERVISION\\nSsn1 Ssn2\\n123456789333445555999887777987654321666884444453453453987987987888665555333445555\\n888665555987654321888665555333445555333445555987654321null(Borg’s Ssn is 888665555)\\n(Ssn) (Super_ssn)\\nRESULT1\\nSsn\\n333445555987654321\\n(Supervised by Borg)\\nRESULT\\nSsn\\n123456789\\n999887777666884444453453453987987987333445555987654321\\n(RESULT1 ∪ RESULT2)RESULT2\\nSsn\\n123456789999887777666884444453453453987987987\\n(Supervised by\\nBorg’s subordinates) Figure 8.11 \\nA two-level recursive query.'),\n",

We can apply an operation LEFT OUTER JOIN , denoted by , to \\nretrieve the result as follows:\\nTEMP  ← (EMPLOYEE   Ssn=Mgr_ssn DEPARTMENT ) \\nRESULT  ← πFname , Minit , Lname , Dname (TEMP )\\nThe LEFT OUTER JOIN  operation keeps every tuple in the first, or left, relation R in R  S; \\nif no matching tuple is found in S, then the attributes of S in the join result are filled or \\npadded  with NULL  values. The result of these operations is shown in Figure 8.12.\\nA similar operation, RIGHT OUTER JOIN , denoted by , keeps every tuple in the \\nsecond , or right, relation S in the result of R  S. A third operation, FULL OUTER \\nJOIN , denoted by , keeps all tuples in both the left and the right relations when no \\nmatching tuples are found, padding them with NULL  values as needed. The three \\nouter join operations are part of the SQL2 standard (see Section 7.1.6). These oper-ations were provided later as an extension of relational algebra in response to the typical need in business applications to show related information from multiple tables exhaustively. Sometimes a complete reporting of data from multiple tables is required whether or not there are matching values.\\n8.4.5 The OUTER UNION Operation\\nThe OUTER UNION  operation was developed to take the union of tuples from two \\nrelations that have some common attributes, but are not union (type) compatible . \\nThis operation will take the UNION  of tuples in two relations R(X, Y) and S(X, Z) \\nthat are partially compatible , meaning that only some of their attributes, say X, are \\nunion compatible. The attributes that are union compatible are represented only \\nonce in the result, and those attributes that are not union compatible from either \\nrelation are also kept in the result relation T(X, Y, Z). It is therefore the same as a \\nFULL OUTER JOIN  on the common attributes.\\nTwo tuples t1 in R and t2 in S are said to match  if t1[X] = t2[X]. These will be com-\\nbined (unioned) into a single tuple in t. Tuples in either relation that have no \\nmatching tuple in the other relation are padded with NULL  values.

Tuples \\nfrom the two relations are matched based on having the same combination of values of the shared attributes—\\nName , Ssn, Department . The resulting relation, \\nSTUDENT_OR_INSTRUCTOR , will have the following attributes:\\nSTUDENT_OR_INSTRUCTOR (Name, Ssn, Department, Advisor, Rank )\\nAll the tuples from both relations are included in the result, but tuples with the \\nsame ( Name , Ssn, Department ) combination will appear only once in the result. \\nTuples appearing only in STUDENT  will have a NULL  for the Rank  attribute, whereas \\ntuples appearing only in INSTRUCTOR  will have a NULL  for the Advisor  attribute. A \\ntuple that exists in both relations, which represent a student who is also an instruc-tor, will have values for all its attributes.\\n11\\nNotice that the same person may still appear twice in the result. For example, we could have a graduate student in the Mathematics department who is an instructor in the Computer Science department. Although the two tuples representing that person in \\nSTUDENT  and INSTRUCTOR  will have the same ( Name , Ssn) values, they \\nwill not agree on the Department  value, and so will not be matched. This is because \\nDepartment  has two different meanings in STUDENT  (the department where the per-\\nson studies) and INSTRUCTOR  (the department where the person is employed as an \\ninstructor). If we wanted to apply the OUTER UNION  based on the same ( Name , Ssn) \\ncombination only, we should rename the Department  attribute in each table to reflect \\nthat they have different meanings and designate them as not being part of the \\nunion-compatible attributes. For example, we could rename the attributes as \\nMajorDept  in STUDENT  and WorkDept  in INSTRUCTOR .\\n8.5 Examples of Queries in Relational Algebra\\nThe following are additional examples to illustrate the use of the relational alge-bra operations. All examples refer to the database in Figure 5.6. In general, the same query can be stated in numerous ways using the various operations. We will state each query in one way and leave it to the reader to come up with equivalent formulations.\\nQuery 1.  Retrieve the name and address of all employees who work for the \\n‘Research’ department.\\nRESEARCH_DEPT  ← σDname =‘Research’ (DEPARTMENT ) \\nRESEARCH_EMPS  ← (RESEARCH_DEPT   Dnumber =DnoEMPLOYEE ) \\nRESULT  ← πFname , Lname , Address (RESEARCH_EMPS )\\nAs a single in-line expression, this query becomes:\\nπFname , Lname , Address  (σDname =‘Research’ (DEPARTMENT   Dnumber =Dno(EMPLOYEE ))\\n11Note that OUTER UNION is equivalent to a FULL OUTER JOIN if the join attributes are all the com-\\nmon attributes of the two relations.'),\n",

As an exercise, \\ntry to do each of these sample queries using different operations.12 We showed how to \\nwrite queries as single relational algebra expressions for queries Q1, Q4, and Q6. Try \\nto write the remaining queries as single expressions. In Chapters 6 and 7 and in Sec-tions 8.6 and 8.7, we show how these queries are written in other relational languages.\\n8.6 The Tuple Relational Calculus\\nIn this and the next section, we introduce another formal query language for the relational model called relational calculus . This section introduces the language \\nknown as tuple relational calculus , and Section 8.7 introduces a variation called \\ndomain relational calculus . In both variations of relational calculus, we write one \\ndeclarative  expression to specify a retrieval request; hence, there is no description \\nof how, or in what order , to evaluate a query. A calculus expression specifies what  is \\nto be retrieved rather than how to retrieve it. Therefore, the relational calculus is \\nconsidered to be a nonprocedural  language. This differs from relational algebra, \\nwhere we must write a sequence of operations  to specify a retrieval request in a par-\\nticular order  of applying the operations; thus, it can be considered as a procedural  \\nway of stating a query. It is possible to nest algebra operations to form a single expression; however, a certain order among the operations is always explicitly spec-ified in a relational algebra expression. This order also influences the strategy for evaluating the query. A calculus expression may be written in different ways, but the way it is written has no bearing on how a query should be evaluated.\\nIt has been shown that any retrieval that can be specified in the basic relational alge-\\nbra can also be specified in relational calculus, and vice versa; in other words, the expressive power  of the languages is identical . This led to the definition of the con-\\ncept of a relationally complete  language. A relational query language L is considered \\nrelationally complete  if we can express in L any query that can be expressed in \\nrelational calculus. Relational completeness has become an important basis for comparing the expressive power of high-level query languages. However, as we saw in Section 8.4, certain frequently required queries in database applications cannot be expressed in basic relational algebra or calculus. Most relational query languages are relationally complete but have more expressive power  than relational algebra or \\nrelational calculus because of additional operations such as aggregate functions, \\ngrouping, and ordering. As we mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, the relational calculus is important for two reasons. First, it has a firm basis in mathe-matical logic. Second, the standard query language (SQL) for RDBMSs has its basic foundation in the tuple relational calculus.\\nOur examples refer to the database shown in Figures 5.6 and 5.7. We will use the \\nsame queries that were used in Section 8.5. Sections 8.6.6, 8.6.7, and 8.6.8 discuss dealing with universal quantifiers and safety of expression issues. Students inter-ested in a basic introduction to tuple relational calculus may skip these sections.\\n12When queries are optimized (see Chapters 18 and 19), the system will choose a particular sequence \\nof operations that corresponds to an execution strategy that can be executed efficiently.'),\n",

A simple tuple relational calculus query is of the form:\\n{t | \\nCOND (t)}\\nwhere t is a tuple variable and COND (t) is a conditional (Boolean) expression \\ninvolving t that evaluates to either TRUE  or FALSE  for different assignments of \\ntuples to the variable t. The result of such a query is the set of all tuples t that evalu-\\nate COND (t) to TRUE . These tuples are said to satisfy  COND (t). For example, to find \\nall employees whose salary is above $50,000, we can write the following tuple calcu-lus expression:\\n{t | \\nEMPLOYEE (t) AND  t.Salary >50000}\\nThe condition EMPLOYEE (t) specifies that the range relation  of tuple variable t is \\nEMPLOYEE . Each EMPLOYEE  tuple t that satisfies the condition t.Salary >50000 will \\nbe retrieved. Notice that t.Salary  references attribute Salary  of tuple variable t; this \\nnotation resembles how attribute names are qualified with relation names or aliases in SQL, as we saw in Chapter 6. In the notation of Chapter 5, t.\\nSalary  is the same as \\nwriting t[Salary ].\\nThe previous query retrieves all attribute values for each selected EMPLOYEE  tuple \\nt. To retrieve only some  of the attributes—say, the first and last names—we write\\nt.Fname , t.Lname  | EMPLOYEE (t) AND  t.Salary >50000}\\nInformally, we need to specify the following information in a tuple relational calcu-\\nlus expression:\\n ■For each tuple variable t, the range relation  R of t. This value is specified by \\na condition of the form R(t). If we do not specify a range relation, then the \\nvariable t will range over all possible tuples “in the universe” as it is not \\nrestricted to any one relation.\\n ■A condition to select particular combinations of tuples. As tuple variables \\nrange over their respective range relations, the condition is evaluated for every possible combination of tuples to identify the selected combinations  \\nfor which the condition evaluates to \\nTRUE .\\n ■A set of attributes to be retrieved, the requested attributes . The values of \\nthese attributes are retrieved for each selected combination of tuples.\\nBefore we discuss the formal syntax of tuple relational calculus, consider another query.\\nQuery 0.  Retrieve the birth date and address of the employee (or employees) \\nwhose name is John B. Smith.\\nQ0: {t.Bdate,  t.Address  | EMPLOYEE (t) AND  t.Fname =‘John’ AND  t.Minit =‘B’  \\n  AND  t.Lname =‘Smith’}'),\n",

A formula is made up of predicate calculus atoms , which can be one \\nof the following:\\n  1. An atom of the form R(ti), where R is a relation name and ti is a tuple vari-\\nable. This atom identifies the range of the tuple variable ti as the relation \\nwhose name is R. It evaluates to TRUE  if ti is a tuple in the relation R, and \\nevaluates to FALSE  otherwise.\\n  2. An atom of the form ti.A op tj.B, where op is one of the comparison opera-\\ntors in the set {=, <, ≤, >, ≥, ≠}, ti and tj are tuple variables, A is an attribute \\nof the relation on which ti ranges, and B is an attribute of the relation on \\nwhich tj ranges.\\n  3. An atom of the form ti.A op c or c op tj.B, where op is one of the comparison \\noperators in the set {=, <, ≤, >, ≥, ≠}, ti and tj are tuple variables, A is an attri-\\nbute of the relation on which ti ranges, B is an attribute of the relation on \\nwhich tj ranges, and c is a constant value.\\nEach of the preceding atoms evaluates to either TRUE  or FALSE  for a specific combi-\\nnation of tuples; this is called the truth value  of an atom. In general, a tuple variable \\nt ranges over all possible tuples in the universe . For atoms of the form R(t), if t is \\nassigned to a tuple that is a member of the specified relation R , the atom is TRUE ; \\notherwise, it is FALSE . In atoms of types 2 and 3, if the tuple variables are assigned \\nto tuples such that the values of the specified attributes of the tuples satisfy the con-dition, then the atom is \\nTRUE .\\nA formula  (Boolean condition) is made up of one or more atoms connected via \\nthe logical operators AND , OR, and NOT  and is defined recursively by Rules 1 and 2 \\nas follows:\\n ■Rule 1 : Every atom is a formula.\\n ■Rule 2 : If F1 and F2 are formulas, then so are ( F1 AND  F2), (F1 OR F2), NOT  \\n(F1), and NOT  (F2). The truth values of these formulas are derived from their \\ncomponent formulas F1 and F2 as follows:\\n13Also called a well-formed formula , or WFF, in mathematical logic.'),\n",

Truth values for \\nformulas with quantifiers are described in Rules 3 and 4 below; first, however, we need to define the concepts of free and bound tuple variables in a formula. Infor-mally, a tuple variable t is bound if it is quantified, meaning that it appears in an \\n(∃t) or ( ∀t) clause; otherwise, it is free. Formally, we define a tuple variable in a \\nformula as free or bound  according to the following rules:\\n ■An occurrence of a tuple variable in a formula F that is an atom  is free in F.\\n ■An occurrence of a tuple variable t is free or bound in a formula made up of \\nlogical connectives—( F1 AND  F2), (F1 OR F2), NOT (F1), and NOT (F2)—\\ndepending on whether it is free or bound in F1 or F2 (if it occurs in either). \\nNotice that in a formula of the form F = (F1 AND  F2) or F = (F1 OR F2), a \\ntuple variable may be free in F1 and bound in F2, or vice versa; in this case, \\none occurrence of the tuple variable is bound and the other is free in F.\\n ■All free occurrences of a tuple variable t in F are bound  in a formula F′ of the \\nform F′= (∃t)(F) or F′ = (∀t)(F). The tuple variable is bound to the quanti-\\nfier specified in F′. For example, consider the following formulas:\\nF1: d.Dname  = ‘Research’ \\nF2: (∃t)(d.Dnumber  = t.Dno) \\nF3: (∀d)(d.Mgr_ssn  = ‘333445555’)\\nThe tuple variable d is free in both F1 and F2, whereas it is bound to the ( ∀) quanti-\\nfier in F3. Variable t is bound to the ( ∃) quantifier in F2.\\nWe can now give Rules 3 and 4 for the definition of a formula we started earlier:\\n ■Rule 3 : If F is a formula, then so is ( ∃t)(F), where t is a tuple variable. The \\nformula ( ∃t)(F) is TRUE  if the formula F evaluates to TRUE  for some  (at least \\none) tuple assigned to free occurrences of t in F; otherwise, ( ∃t)(F) is FALSE .\\n ■Rule 4 : If F is a formula, then so is ( ∀t)(F), where t is a tuple variable. The for-\\nmula ( ∀t)(F) is TRUE  if the formula F evaluates to TRUE  for every tuple  (in the \\nuniverse) assigned to free occurrences of t in F; otherwise, ( ∀t)(F) is FALSE .\\nThe ( ∃) quantifier is called an existential quantifier because a formula ( ∃t)(F) is \\nTRUE  if there exists  some tuple that makes F TRUE . For the universal quantifier,  \\n(∀t)(F) is TRUE  if every possible tuple that can be assigned to free occurrences of  \\nt in F is substituted for t, and F is TRUE  for every such substitution . It is called the \\nuniversal or for all  quantifier because every tuple in the universe of  tuples must \\nmake F TRUE  to make the quantified formula TRUE .'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 302}, page_content='272 Chapter 8 The Relational Algebra and Relational Calculus\\n8.6.4 Sample Queries in Tuple Relational Calculus\\nWe will use some of the same queries from Section 8.5 to give a flavor of how the \\nsame queries are specified in relational algebra and in relational calculus. Notice that some queries are easier to specify in the relational algebra than in the relational calculus, and vice versa.\\nQuery 1.  List the name and address of all employees who work for the ‘Research’ \\ndepartment.\\nQ1:  {t.Fname, t.Lname, t.Address  | EMPLOYEE (t) AND  (∃d)(DEPARTMENT (d)  \\nAND  d.Dname =‘Research’ AND  d.Dnumber =t.Dno )}\\nThe only free tuple variables  in a tuple relational calculus expression should be those \\nthat appear to the left of the bar (|). In Q1, t is the only free variable; it is then bound \\nsuccessively  to each tuple. If a tuple satisfies the conditions  specified after the bar in \\nQ1, the attributes Fname , Lname , and Address  are retrieved for each such tuple. The \\nconditions EMPLOYEE (t) and DEPARTMENT (d) specify the range relations for t  \\nand d. The condition d.Dname  = ‘Research’ is a selection condition  and corre-\\nsponds to a SELECT  operation in the relational algebra, whereas the condition \\nd.Dnumber  = t.Dno is a join condition  and is similar in purpose to the ( INNER ) JOIN  \\noperation (see Section 8.3).\\nQuery 2.  For every project located in ‘Stafford’, list the project number, the con-\\ntrolling department number, and the department manager’s last name, birth date, and address.\\nQ2:  {p.Pnumber, p.Dnum, m.Lname, m.Bdate, m.Address  | PROJECT (p) AND  \\nEMPLOYEE (m) AND  p.Plocation =‘Stafford’ AND  ((∃d)(DEPARTMENT (d) \\nAND  p.Dnum =d.Dnumber AND  d.Mgr_ssn =m.Ssn))}\\nIn Q2 there are two free tuple variables, p and m. Tuple variable d is bound to the \\nexistential quantifier. The query condition is evaluated for every combination of tuples assigned to p and m, and out of all possible combinations of tuples to which \\np and m are bound, only the combinations that satisfy the condition are selected.\\nSeveral tuple variables in a query can range over the same relation. For example, to \\nspecify \\nQ8—for each employee, retrieve the employee’s first and last name and the \\nfirst and last name of his or her immediate supervisor—we specify two tuple vari-ables e and s that both range over the \\nEMPLOYEE  relation:\\nQ8:  {e.Fname, e.Lname, s.Fname, s.Lname  | EMPLOYEE (e) AND  EMPLOYEE (s)  \\nAND  e.Super_ssn =s.Ssn}\\nQuery 3 ′. List the name of each employee who works on some  project controlled \\nby department number 5. This is a variation of Q3 in which all is changed to \\nsome . In this case we need two join conditions and two existential quantifiers.\\nQ0′:  {e.Lname, e.Fname  | EMPLOYEE (e) AND  ((∃x)(∃w)(PROJECT (x) AND   \\nWORKS_ON (w) AND  x.Dnum =5 AND  w.Essn =e.Ssn AND   \\nx.Pnumber =w.Pno))}'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 303}, page_content='8.6 The Tuple Relational Calculus  273\\nQuery 4.  Make a list of project numbers for projects that involve an employee \\nwhose last name is ‘Smith’, either as a worker or as manager of the controlling department for the project.\\nQ4:  { p.Pnumber  | PROJECT (p) AND  (((∃e)(∃w)(EMPLOYEE (e) \\nAND  WORKS_ON (w) AND  w.Pno=p.Pnumber  \\nAND  e.Lname =‘Smith’ AND  e.Ssn=w.Essn ) ) \\nOR \\n((∃m)(∃d)(EMPLOYEE (m) AND  DEPARTMENT (d) \\nAND  p.Dnum =d.Dnumber AND  d.Mgr_ssn =m.Ssn \\nAND  m.Lname =‘Smith’)))}\\nCompare this with the relational algebra version of this query in Section 8.5. The \\nUNION  operation in relational algebra can usually be substituted with an OR con-\\nnective in relational calculus.\\n8.6.5 Notation for Query Graphs\\nIn this section, we describe a notation that has been proposed to represent relational calculus queries that do not involve complex quantification in a graphical form. These types of queries are known as select-project-join queries  because they only \\ninvolve these three relational algebra operations. The notation may be expanded to more general queries, but we do not discuss these extensions here. This graphical representation of a query is called a query graph . Figure 8.13 shows the query graph \\nfor \\nQ2. Relations in the query are represented by relation nodes , which are displayed \\nas single circles. Constant values, typically from the query selection conditions, are represented by constant nodes , which are displayed as double circles or ovals. Selec-\\ntion and join conditions are represented by the graph edges  (the lines that connect \\nthe nodes), as shown in Figure 8.13. Finally, the attributes to be retrieved from each relation are displayed in square brackets above each relation.\\nThe query graph representation does not indicate a particular order to specify which \\noperations to perform first, and is hence a more neutral representation of a select-project-join query than the query tree representation (see Section 8.3.5), where the order of execution is implicitly specified. There is only a single query graph corre-sponding to each query. Although some query optimization techniques were based on query graphs, it is now generally accepted that query trees are preferable because, \\n[P.Pnumber,P.Dnum] [E.Lname,E.address,E.Bdate]\\nP.Dnum=D.Dnumber\\nP.Plocation=‘Stafford’PDE\\n‘Stafford’D.Mgr_ssn=E.SsnFigure 8.13 \\nQuery graph for Q2.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 304}, page_content='274 Chapter 8 The Relational Algebra and Relational Calculus\\nin practice, the query optimizer needs to show the order of operations for query \\nexecution, which is not possible in query graphs.\\nIn the next section we discuss the relationship between the universal and existential \\nquantifiers and show how one can be transformed into the other.\\n8.6.6 Transforming the Universal and Existential Quantifiers\\nWe now introduce some well-known transformations from mathematical logic that relate the universal and existential quantifiers. It is possible to transform a universal quantifier into an existential quantifier, and vice versa, to get an equivalent expres-sion. One general transformation can be described informally as follows: Trans-form one type of quantifier into the other with negation (preceded by \\nNOT ); AND  \\nand OR replace one another; a negated formula becomes unnegated; and an un-\\nnegated formula becomes negated. Some special cases of this transformation can be stated as follows, where the ≡ symbol stands for equivalent to :\\n(∀x) (P(x)) ≡ \\nNOT  (∃x) (NOT  (P(x))) \\n(∃x) (P(x)) ≡ NOT  (∀x) (NOT  (P(x))) \\n(∀x) (P(x) AND  Q(x)) ≡ NOT  (∃x) (NOT  (P(x)) OR NOT  (Q(x))) \\n(∀x) (P(x) OR Q(x)) ≡ NOT  (∃x) (NOT  (P(x)) AND  NOT  (Q(x))) \\n(∃x) (P(x)) OR Q(x)) ≡ NOT  (∀x) (NOT  (P(x)) AND  NOT  (Q(x))) \\n(∃x) (P(x) AND  Q(x)) ≡ NOT  (∀x) (NOT  (P(x)) OR NOT  (Q(x)))\\nNotice also that the following is TRUE , where the ⇒ symbol stands for implies :\\n(∀x)(P(x)) ⇒ (∃x)(P(x)) \\nNOT  (∃x)(P(x)) ⇒ NOT  (∀x)(P(x))\\n8.6.7 Using the Universal Quantifier in Queries\\nWhenever we use a universal quantifier, it is quite judicious to follow a few rules to \\nensure that our expression makes sense. We discuss these rules with respect to the query \\nQ3.\\nQuery 3.  List the names of employees who work on all the projects controlled \\nby department number 5. One way to specify this query is to use the universal quantifier as shown:\\nQ3:  {e.Lname,  e.Fname  | EMPLOYEE (e) AND  ((∀x)(NOT (PROJECT (x)) OR NOT  \\n(x.Dnum =5) OR ((∃w)(WORKS_ON (w) AND  w.Essn =e.Ssn AND   \\nx.Pnumber =w.Pno))))}\\nWe can break up Q3 into its basic components as follows:\\nQ3:  {e.Lname,  e.Fname  | EMPLOYEE (e) AND  F′} \\nF′ = ((∀x)(NOT (PROJECT (x)) OR F1)) \\nF1 = NOT (x.Dnum =5) OR F2 \\nF2 = ((∃w)(WORKS_ON (w) AND  w.Essn =e.Ssn \\nAND  x.Pnumber =w.Pno))'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 305}, page_content='8.6 The Tuple Relational Calculus  275\\nWe want to make sure that a selected employee e works on all the projects  con-\\ntrolled by department 5, but the definition of universal quantifier  says that to \\nmake the quantified formula TRUE , the inner formula  must be TRUE  for all tuples \\nin the universe . The trick is to exclude from the universal quantification all tuples \\nthat we are not interested in by making the condition TRUE  for all such tuples . \\nThis is necessary because a universally quantified tuple variable, such as x in Q3, \\nmust evaluate to TRUE  for every possible tuple  assigned to it to make the quantified \\nformula TRUE .\\nThe first tuples to exclude (by making them evaluate automatically to TRUE ) are \\nthose that are not in the relation R of interest. In Q3, using the expression \\nNOT (PROJECT (x)) inside the universally quantified formula evaluates to TRUE  all \\ntuples x that are not in the PROJECT  relation. Then we exclude the tuples we are not \\ninterested in from R itself. In Q3, using the expression NOT (x.Dnum =5) evaluates to \\nTRUE  all tuples x that are in the PROJECT  relation but are not controlled by depart-\\nment 5. Finally, we specify a condition F2 that must hold on all the remaining tuples \\nin R. Hence, we can explain Q3 as follows:\\n  1. For the formula F′ = (∀x)(F) to be TRUE , we must have the formula F be \\nTRUE  for all tuples in the universe that can be assigned to x . However, in Q3 \\nwe are only interested in F being TRUE  for all tuples of the PROJECT  relation \\nthat are controlled by department 5. Hence, the formula F is of the form \\n(NOT (PROJECT (x)) OR F1). The ‘ NOT  (PROJECT (x)) OR …’ condition is \\nTRUE  for all tuples not in the PROJECT  relation  and has the effect of elimi-\\nnating these tuples from consideration in the truth value of F1. For every \\ntuple in the PROJECT  relation, F1 must be TRUE  if F′ is to be TRUE .\\n  2. Using the same line of reasoning, we do not want to consider tuples in the \\nPROJECT  relation that are not controlled by department number 5, since we \\nare only interested in PROJECT  tuples whose Dnum =5. Therefore, we can \\nwrite:\\nIF (x.Dnum =5) THEN  F2\\nwhich is equivalent to\\n(NOT  (x.Dnum =5) OR F2)\\n  3. Formula F1, hence, is of the form NOT (x.Dnum =5) OR F2. In the context of \\nQ3, this means that, for a tuple x in the PROJECT  relation, either its Dnum ≠5 \\nor it must satisfy F2.\\n  4. Finally, F2 gives the condition that we want to hold for a selected EMPLOYEE  \\ntuple: that the employee works on every  PROJECT  tuple that has not been \\nexcluded yet . Such employee tuples are selected by the query.\\nIn English, Q3 gives the following condition for selecting an EMPLOYEE  tuple e: \\nFor every tuple x in the PROJECT  relation with x.Dnum =5, there must exist a tuple \\nw in WORKS_ON  such that w.Essn =e.Ssn and w.Pno=x.Pnumber . This is equivalent \\nto saying that EMPLOYEE  e works on every PROJECT  x in DEPARTMENT  number 5. \\n(Whew!)'),\n",

A safe expression  in relational calculus is one that is guaranteed to \\nyield a finite number of tuples  as its result; otherwise, the expression is called unsafe . \\nFor example, the expression\\n{t | \\nNOT  (EMPLOYEE (t))}\\nis unsafe  because it yields all tuples in the universe that are not EMPLOYEE  tuples, \\nwhich are infinitely numerous. If we follow the rules for Q3 discussed earlier, we \\nwill get a safe expression when using universal quantifiers. We can define safe \\nexpressions more precisely by introducing the concept of the domain of a tuple \\nrelational calculus expression:  This is the set of all values that either appear as \\nconstant values in the expression or exist in any tuple in the relations referenced in the expression. For example, the domain of { t | \\nNOT (EMPLOYEE (t))} is the set \\nof all attribute values appearing in some tuple of the EMPLOYEE  relation (for any \\nattribute). The domain of the expression Q3A  would include all values appearing \\nin EMPLOYEE , PROJECT , and WORKS_ON  (unioned with the value 5 appearing in \\nthe query itself).\\nAn expression is said to be safe if all values in its result are from the domain of the \\nexpression. Notice that the result of { t | NOT (EMPLOYEE (t))} is unsafe, since it will,'),\n",

All of our other examples are safe expressions.\\n8.7 The Domain Relational Calculus\\nThere is another type of relational calculus called the domain relational calculus, or simply domain calculus . Historically, while SQL (see Chapters 6 and 7), which was \\nbased on tuple relational calculus, was being developed by IBM Research at San Jose, California, another language called QBE (Query-By-Example), which is related to domain calculus, was being developed almost concurrently at the IBM  T. J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York. The formal specifi-cation of the domain calculus was proposed after the development of the QBE lan-guage and system.\\nDomain calculus differs from tuple calculus in the type of variables  used in formu-\\nlas: Rather than having variables range over tuples, the variables range over single values from domains of attributes. To form a relation of degree n for a query result, \\nwe must have n of these domain variables —one for each attribute. An expression \\nof the domain calculus is of the form\\n{x\\n1, x2, ..., xn | COND (x1, x2, ..., xn, xn+1, xn+2, ..., xn+m)}\\nwhere x1, x2, … , xn, xn+1, xn+2, … , xn+m are domain variables that range over \\ndomains (of attributes), and COND  is a condition  or formula  of the domain \\nrelational calculus.\\nA formula is made up of atoms . The atoms of a formula are slightly different from \\nthose for the tuple calculus and can be one of the following:\\n  1. An atom of the form R( x1, x2, … , xj), where R is the name of a relation of \\ndegree j and each xi, 1 ≤ i ≤ j, is a domain variable. This atom states that a list \\nof values of < x1, x2, … , xj> must be a tuple in the relation whose name is R, \\nwhere xi is the value of the ith attribute value of the tuple. To make a domain \\ncalculus expression more concise, we can drop the commas  in a list of vari-\\nables; thus, we can write:\\n{x1, x2, ..., xn | R(x1 x2 x3) AND  ...}\\ninstead of:\\n{x1, x2, ... , xn | R(x1, x2, x3) AND  ...}\\n  2. An atom of the form xi op xj, where op is one of the comparison operators in \\nthe set {=, <, ≤, >, ≥, ≠}, and xi and xj are domain variables.\\n  3. An atom of the form xi op c or c op xj, where op is one of the comparison \\noperators in the set {=, <, ≤, >, ≥, ≠}, xi and xj are domain variables, and c is \\na constant value.\\nAs in tuple calculus, atoms evaluate to either TRUE  or FALSE  for a specific set of \\nvalues, called the truth values  of the atoms. In case 1, if the domain variables are'),\n",

In cases 2 and 3, if the domain variables are assigned values that satisfy the \\ncondition, then the atom is TRUE .\\nIn a similar way to the tuple relational calculus, formulas are made up of atoms, \\nvariables, and quantifiers, so we will not repeat the specifications for formulas here. \\nSome examples of queries specified in the domain calculus follow. We will use low-ercase letters l, m, n, … , x, y, z for domain variables.\\nQuery 0.  List the birth date and address of the employee whose name is ‘John \\nB. Smith’.\\nQ0:  {u, v | (∃q) (∃r) (∃s) (∃t) (∃w) (∃x) (∃y) (∃z)  \\n(EMPLOYEE (qrstuvwxyz ) AND  q=‘John’ AND  r=‘B’ AND  s=‘Smith’)}\\nWe need ten variables for the EMPLOYEE  relation, one to range over each of the \\ndomains of attributes of EMPLOYEE  in order. Of the ten variables q, r, s, … , z, \\nonly u and v are free, because they appear to the left of the bar and hence should \\nnot be bound to a quantifier. We first specify the requested attributes , Bdate  and \\nAddress , by the free domain variables u for BDATE  and v for ADDRESS . Then we \\nspecify the condition for selecting a tuple following the bar (|)—namely, that the \\nsequence of values assigned to the variables qrstuvwxyz  be a tuple of the EMPLOYEE  \\nrelation and that the values for q (Fname ), r (Minit ), and s (Lname ) be equal to \\n‘John’, ‘B’, and ‘Smith’, respectively. For convenience, we will quantify only those \\nvariables actually appearing in a condition  (these would be q, r, and s in Q0) in the \\nrest of our examples.14\\nAn alternative shorthand notation, used in QBE, for writing this query is to assign the constants ‘John’, ‘B’, and ‘Smith’ directly as shown in \\nQ0A . Here, all variables \\nnot appearing to the left of the bar are implicitly existentially quantified:15\\nQ0A:  {u, v | EMPLOYEE (‘John’, ‘B’, ‘Smith’, t, u, v, w, x, y, z)}\\nQuery 1.  Retrieve the name and address of all employees who work for the \\n‘Research’ department.\\nQ1:  {q, s, v | (∃z) (∃l) (∃m) (EMPLOYEE (qrstuvwxyz ) AND   \\nDEPARTMENT (lmno ) AND  l=‘Research’ AND  m=z )}\\nA condition relating two domain variables that range over attributes from two rela-\\ntions, such as m = z in Q1, is a join condition , whereas a condition that relates a \\ndomain variable to a constant, such as l = ‘Research’, is a selection condition .\\nQuery 2.  For every project located in ‘Stafford’, list the project number, the con-\\ntrolling department number, and the department manager’s last name, birth \\ndate, and address.\\n14Quantifying only the domain variables actually used in conditions and specifying a predicate such as \\nEMPLOYEE( qrstuvwxyz ) without separating domain variables with commas is an abbreviated notation \\nused for convenience; it is not the correct formal notation.\\n15Again, this is not a formally accurate notation.'),\n",

QBE was one of the first \\ngraphical query languages with minimum syntax developed for database systems. It was developed at IBM Research and is available as an IBM commercial product as part of the Query Management Facility (QMF) interface option to DB2. The basic ideas used in QBE have been applied in several other commercial products. Because of its important place in the history of relational languages, we have included an overview of QBE in Appendix C.\\n8.8 Summary\\nIn this chapter we presented two formal languages for the relational model of data. They are used to manipulate relations and produce new relations as answers to que-ries. We discussed the relational algebra and its operations, which are used to spec-ify a sequence of operations to specify a query. Then we introduced two types of relational calculi called tuple calculus and domain calculus.\\nIn Sections 8.1 through 8.3, we introduced the basic relational algebra operations \\nand illustrated the types of queries for which each is used. First, we discussed the unary relational operators \\nSELECT  and PROJECT , as well as the RENAME  operation. \\nThen, we discussed binary set theoretic operations requiring that relations on  which they are applied be union (or type) compatible; these include \\nUNION ,  \\nINTERSECTION , and SET DIFFERENCE . The CARTESIAN PRODUCT  operation is a  \\nset operation that can be used to combine tuples from two relations, producing  \\nall possible combinations. It is rarely used in practice; however, we showed how'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 310}, page_content='280 Chapter 8 The Relational Algebra and Relational Calculus\\nCARTESIAN PRODUCT  followed by SELECT  can be used to define matching tuples \\nfrom two relations and leads to the JOIN  operation. Different JOIN  operations called \\nTHETA JOIN , EQUIJOIN , and NATURAL JOIN  were introduced. Query trees were intro-\\nduced as a graphical representation of relational algebra queries, which can also be used as the basis for internal data structures that the DBMS can use to represent a query.\\nWe discussed some important types of queries that cannot  be stated with the basic \\nrelational algebra operations but are important for practical situations. We intro-duced \\nGENERALIZED PROJECTION  to use functions of attributes in the projection \\nlist and the AGGREGATE FUNCTION  operation to deal with aggregate types of statis-\\ntical requests that summarize the information in the tables. We discussed recursive queries, for which there is no direct support in the algebra but which can be han-dled in a step-by-step approach, as we demonstrated. Then we presented the \\nOUTER \\nJOIN  and OUTER UNION  operations, which extend JOIN  and UNION  and allow all \\ninformation in source relations to be preserved in the result.\\nThe last two sections described the basic concepts behind relational calculus, which \\nis based on the branch of mathematical logic called predicate calculus. There are \\ntwo types of relational calculi: (1) the tuple relational calculus, which uses tuple \\nvariables that range over tuples (rows) of relations, and (2) the domain relational \\ncalculus, which uses domain variables that range over domains (columns of rela-tions). In relational calculus, a query is specified in a single declarative statement, without specifying any order or method for retrieving the query result. Hence, rela-tional calculus is often considered to be a higher-level declarative  language than the \\nrelational algebra, because a relational calculus expression states what  we want to \\nretrieve regardless of how the query may be executed.\\nWe introduced query graphs as an internal representation for queries in relational \\ncalculus. We also discussed the existential quantifier ( ∃) and the universal quanti-\\nfier ( ∀). We discussed the problem of specifying safe queries whose results are \\nfinite. We also discussed rules for transforming universal into existential quantifi-ers, and vice versa. It is the quantifiers that give expressive power to the relational calculus, making it equivalent to the basic relational algebra. There is no analog to grouping and aggregation functions in basic relational calculus, although some extensions have been suggested.\\nReview Questions\\n 8.1.

Date (1983a) discusses outer joins. Work on extending relational operations is discussed by Carlis (1986) and Ozsoyo-glu et al. (1985). Cammarata et al. (1989) extends the relational model integrity constraints and joins.\\nCodd (1971) introduced the language Alpha, which is based on concepts of tuple \\nrelational calculus. Alpha also includes the notion of aggregate functions, which goes beyond relational calculus. The original formal definition of relational calculus was given by Codd (1972), which also provided an algorithm that transforms any \\ntuple relational calculus expression to relational algebra. The QUEL (Stonebraker et \\nal., 1976) is based on tuple relational calculus, with implicit existential quantifiers, but no universal quantifiers, and was implemented in the INGRES system as a com-mercially available language. Codd defined relational completeness of a query lan-guage to mean at least as powerful as relational calculus. Ullman (1988) describes a formal proof of the equivalence of relational algebra with the safe expressions of tuple and domain relational calculus. Abiteboul et al. (1995) and Atzeni and deAn-tonellis (1993) give a detailed treatment of formal relational languages.\\nAlthough ideas of domain relational calculus were initially proposed in the QBE \\nlanguage (Zloof, 1975), the concept was formally defined by Lacroix and Pirotte \\n(1977a). The experimental version of the Query-By-Example system is described in \\nZloof (1975). The ILL (Lacroix & Pirotte, 1977b) is based on domain relational cal-\\nculus. Whang et al. (1990) extends QBE with universal quantifiers. Visual query \\nlanguages, of which QBE is an example, are being proposed as a means of querying \\ndatabases; conferences such as the Visual Database Systems Working Conference \\n(e.g., Arisawa & Catarci (2000) or Zhou & Pu (2002)) present a number of propos-als for such languages.'),\n",

Figure 3.1 presented a high-level view of the database design process. In this chapter we focus on the logical database design  step of database design, which is \\nalso known as data model mapping . We present the procedures to create a rela-\\ntional schema from an entity–relationship (ER) or an enhanced ER (EER) schema. Our discussion relates the constructs of the ER and EER models, presented in Chapters 3 and 4, to the constructs of the relational model, presented in Chapters 5 through 8. Many computer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools are based on the ER or EER models, or other similar models, as we have discussed in Chapters 3 and 4. Many tools use ER or EER diagrams or variations to develop the schema graphically and collect information about the data types and constraints, then con-vert the ER/EER schema automatically into a relational database schema in the DDL of a specific relational DBMS. The design tools employ algorithms similar to the ones presented in this chapter.\\nWe outline a seven-step algorithm in Section 9.1 to convert the basic ER model \\nconstructs—entity types (strong and weak), binary relationships (with various \\nstructural constraints), n-ary relationships, and attributes (simple, composite, \\nand multivalued)—into relations. Then, in Section 9.2, we continue the mapping algorithm by describing how to map EER model constructs—specializa- tion/ generalization and union types (categories)—into relations.

We assume that the mapping will create tables with simple single-\\nvalued attributes. The relational model constraints defined in Chapter 5, which include primary keys, unique keys (if any), and referential integrity constraints on the relations, will also be specified in the mapping results.\\nStep 1: Mapping of Regular Entity Types. For each regular (strong) entity type \\nE in the ER schema, create a relation R that includes all the simple attributes of E. \\nInclude only the simple component attributes of a composite attribute. Choose one of the key attributes of E as the primary key for R. If the chosen key of E is a com-\\nposite, then the set of simple attributes that form it will together form the primary key of R.\\nIf multiple keys were identified for E during the conceptual design, the information \\ndescribing the attributes that form each additional key is kept in order to specify additional (unique) keys of relation R. Knowledge about keys is also kept for index-\\ning purposes and other types of analyses.\\nIn our example, we create the relations \\nEMPLOYEE , DEPARTMENT , and PROJECT  in \\nFigure 9.2 to correspond to the regular entity types EMPLOYEE , DEPARTMENT , and \\nPROJECT  from Figure 9.1. The foreign key and relationship attributes, if any,  \\nare not included yet; they will be added during subsequent steps.

In our example, we choose Ssn, Dnumber , and \\nPnumber  as primary keys for the relations EMPLOYEE , DEPARTMENT , and PROJECT , \\nrespectively. Knowledge that Dname  of DEPARTMENT  and Pname  of PROJECT  are \\nunique keys is kept for possible use later in the design.\\nThe relations that are created from the mapping of entity types are sometimes called \\nentity relations  because each tuple represents an entity instance. The result after \\nthis mapping step is shown in Figure 9.3(a).\\nStep 2: Mapping of Weak Entity Types. For each weak entity type W in the \\nER schema with owner entity type E, create a relation R and include all simple \\nattributes (or simple components of composite attributes) of W as attributes of \\nR. In addition, include as foreign key attributes of R, the primary key attribute(s) \\nof the relation(s) that correspond to the owner entity type(s); this takes care of mapping the identifying relationship type of W. The primary key of R is the \\ncombination of the primary key(s) of the owner(s) and the partial key of the weak entity type W, if any. If there is a weak entity type E\\n2 whose owner is also \\na weak entity type E1, then E1 should be mapped before E2 to determine its \\nprimary key first.\\nIn our example, we create the relation DEPENDENT  in this step to correspond to  \\nthe weak entity type DEPENDENT  (see Figure 9.3(b)). We include the primary key \\nSsn of the EMPLOYEE  relation—which corresponds to the owner entity type— \\nas a foreign key attribute of DEPENDENT ; we rename it Essn , although this is not  \\nDEPART MENTFname Minit Lname Ssn Bdate Address Sex SalaryEMPLOYEE\\nWORKS_ON\\nEssn Pno HoursDname Dnumber\\nDEPT_LOCATIONS\\nDnumber DlocationPROJECT\\nPname Pnumber Plocation\\nDEPENDENT(a)\\n(c)\\n(d)(b)\\nEssn Dependent_name Sex Bdate RelationshipFigure 9.3 \\nIllustration of some  mapping steps.(a) Entity  relations  \\nafter step 1.(b) Additional weak entity  \\nrelation after step 2.(c) Relationship  relations \\nafter step 5.(d) Relation representing multivalued attribute  after step 6.'),\n",

The primary key of the DEPENDENT  relation is the combination { Essn , \\nDependent_name }, because Dependent_name  (also renamed from Name  in Figure 9.1) \\nis the partial key of DEPENDENT .\\nIt is common to choose the propagate ( CASCADE ) option for the referential trig-\\ngered action (see Section 6.2) on the foreign key in the relation corresponding to the weak entity type, since a weak entity has an existence dependency on its owner entity. This can be used for both \\nON UPDATE  and ON DELETE .\\nStep 3: Mapping of Binary 1:1 Relationship Types. For each binary 1:1 rela-\\ntionship type R in the ER schema, identify the relations S and T that correspond  \\nto the entity types participating in R. There are three possible approaches: (1) the \\nforeign key approach, (2) the merged relationship approach, and (3) the cross- reference or relationship relation approach. The first approach is the most useful and should be followed unless special conditions exist, as we discuss below.\\n  1. Foreign key approach:  Choose one of the relations— S, say—and include as \\na foreign key in S the primary key of T. It is better to choose an entity type \\nwith total participation  in R in the role of S. Include all the simple attributes \\n(or simple components of composite attributes) of the 1:1 relationship type R as attributes of S.\\nIn our example, we map the 1:1 relationship type \\nMANAGES  from Figure 9.1 \\nby choosing the participating entity type DEPARTMENT  to serve in the role \\nof S because its participation in the MANAGES  relationship type is total \\n(every department has a manager). We include the primary key of the \\nEMPLOYEE  relation as foreign key in the DEPARTMENT  relation and rename \\nit to Mgr_ssn . We also include the simple attribute Start_date  of the MANAGES  \\nrelationship type in the DEPARTMENT  relation and rename it Mgr_start_date  \\n(see Figure 9.2 ).\\nNote that it is possible to include the primary key of S as a foreign key in T \\ninstead. In our example, this amounts to having a foreign key attribute, say \\nDepartment_managed  in the EMPLOYEE  relation, but it will have a NULL  value \\nfor employee tuples who do not manage a department. This would be a bad \\nchoice, because if only 2% of employees manage a department, then 98% of \\nthe foreign keys would be NULL  in this case. Another possibility is to have \\nforeign keys in both relations S and T redundantly, but this creates redun-\\ndancy and incurs a penalty for consistency maintenance.\\n  2. Merged relation approach:  An alternative mapping of a 1:1 relationship \\ntype is to merge the two entity types and the relationship into a single rela-\\ntion. This is possible when both participations are total,  as this would indi-\\ncate that the two tables will have the exact same number of tuples at all times.\\n  3. Cross-reference or relationship relation approach:  The third option is to \\nset up a third relation R for the purpose of cross-referencing the primary \\nkeys of the two relations S and T representing the entity types. As we will see, \\nthis approach is required for binary M:N relationships. The relation R is \\ncalled a relationship relation  (or sometimes a lookup table ), because each'),\n",

The relation R will include the primary key attributes \\nof S and T as foreign keys to S and T. The primary key of R will be one of the \\ntwo foreign keys, and the other foreign key will be a unique key of R. The \\ndrawback is having an extra relation, and requiring extra join operations when combining related tuples from the tables.\\nStep 4: Mapping of Binary 1:N Relationship Types. There are two possible \\napproaches: (1) the foreign key approach and (2) the cross-reference or relationship \\nrelation approach. The first approach is generally preferred as it reduces the num-\\nber of tables.\\n  1. The foreign key approach:  For each regular binary 1:N relationship type R, \\nidentify the relation S that represents the participating entity type at the \\nN-side  of the relationship type. Include as foreign key in S the primary key of \\nthe relation T that represents the other entity type participating in R; we do \\nthis because each entity instance on the N-side is related to at most one entity instance on the 1-side of the relationship type. Include any simple attributes (or simple components of composite attributes) of the 1:N rela-tionship type as attributes of S.\\nTo apply this approach to our example, we map the 1:N relationship types \\nWORKS_FOR , CONTROLS , and SUPERVISION  from Figure 9.1. For  \\nWORKS_FOR  we include the primary key Dnumber  of the DEPARTMENT  relation \\nas foreign key in the EMPLOYEE  relation and call it Dno. For SUPERVISION  we \\ninclude the primary key of the EMPLOYEE  relation as foreign key in the \\nEMPLOYEE  relation itself—because the relationship is recursive—and call it \\nSuper_ssn . The CONTROLS  relationship is mapped to the foreign key attri-\\nbute Dnum  of PROJECT , which references the primary key Dnumber  of the \\nDEPARTMENT  relation. These foreign keys are shown in Figure 9.2.\\n  2. The relationship relation approach:  An alternative approach is to use the \\nrelationship relation  (cross-reference) option as in the third option for \\nbinary 1:1 relationships. We create a separate relation R whose attributes are \\nthe primary keys of S and T, which will also be foreign keys to S and T. The \\nprimary key of R is the same as the primary key of S. This option can be used \\nif few tuples in S participate in the relationship to avoid excessive NULL  val-\\nues in the foreign key.\\nStep 5: Mapping of Binary M:N Relationship Types. In the traditional rela-\\ntional model with no multivalued attributes, the only option for M:N relationships is the relationship relation (cross-reference) option . For each binary M:N rela-\\ntionship type R, create a new relation S to represent R. Include as foreign key attri-\\nbutes in S the primary keys of the relations that represent the participating entity \\ntypes; their combination  will form the primary key of S. Also include any simple \\nattributes of the M:N relationship type (or simple components of composite attri-butes) as attributes of S. Notice that we cannot represent an M:N relationship type \\nby a single foreign key attribute in one of the participating relations (as we did for'),\n",

We include the primary keys of the \\nPROJECT  and EMPLOYEE  relations as foreign keys in WORKS_ON  and rename \\nthem Pno and Essn , respectively (renaming is not required;  it is a design choice). \\nWe also include an attribute Hours  in WORKS_ON  to represent the Hours  attribute \\nof the relationship type. The primary key of the WORKS_ON  relation is the combi-\\nnation of the foreign key attributes { Essn , Pno}. This relationship relation  is \\nshown in Figure 9.3(c).\\nThe propagate ( CASCADE ) option for the referential triggered action (see Sec- \\ntion 4.2) should be specified on the foreign keys in the relation corresponding to the relationship R, since each relationship instance has an existence dependency on \\neach of the entities it relates. This can be used for both \\nON UPDATE  and ON DELETE .\\nAlthough we can map 1:1 or 1:N relationships in a manner similar to M:N relation-\\nships by using the cross-reference (relationship relation) approach, as we discussed earlier, this is only recommended when few relationship instances exist, in order to avoid \\nNULL  values in foreign keys. In this case, the primary key of the relationship \\nrelation will be only one  of the foreign keys that reference the participating entity \\nrelations. For a 1:N relationship, the primary key of the relationship relation will be \\nthe foreign key that references the entity relation on the N-side. For a 1:1 relation-\\nship, either foreign key can be used as the primary key of the relationship relation.\\nStep 6: Mapping of Multivalued Attributes. For each multivalued attribute A, \\ncreate a new relation R. This relation R will include an attribute corresponding to A, \\nplus the primary key attribute K—as a foreign key in R—of the relation that repre-\\nsents the entity type or relationship type that has A as a multivalued attribute. The \\nprimary key of R is the combination of A and K. If the multivalued attribute is com-\\nposite, we include its simple components.\\nIn our example, we create a relation DEPT_LOCATIONS  (see Figure 9.3(d)).  \\nThe attribute Dlocation  represents the multivalued attribute LOCATIONS  of  \\nDEPARTMENT , whereas Dnumber —as foreign key—represents the primary key of the \\nDEPARTMENT  relation. The primary key of DEPT_LOCATIONS  is the combination of \\n{Dnumber , Dlocation }. A separate tuple will exist in DEPT_LOCATIONS  for each loca-\\ntion that a department has. It is important to note that in more recent versions of \\nthe relational model that allow array data types, the multivalued attribute can be \\nmapped to an array attribute rather than requiring a separate table.\\nThe propagate ( CASCADE ) option for the referential triggered action (see Sec- \\ntion 6.2) should be specified on the foreign key in the relation R corresponding to the \\nmultivalued attribute for both ON UPDATE  and ON DELETE . We should also note \\nthat the key of R when mapping a composite, multivalued attribute requires some \\nanalysis of the meaning of the component attributes. In some cases, when a multi-\\nvalued attribute is composite, only some of the component attributes are required'),\n",

Notice that we did not yet discuss the mapping of n-ary relationship types ( n > 2) because none exist in Fig-\\nure 9.1 ; these are mapped in a similar way to M:N relationship types by including the following additional step in the mapping algorithm.\\nStep 7: Mapping of N-ary Relationship Types. We use the relationship  \\nrelation option . For each n-ary relationship type R, where n > 2, create a new relation-\\nship relation S to represent R. Include as foreign key attributes in S the primary keys \\nof the relations that represent the participating entity types. Also include any simple attributes of the n-ary relationship type (or simple components of composite attri-\\nbutes) as attributes of S. The primary key of S is usually a combination of all the \\nforeign keys that reference the relations representing the participating entity types. However, if the cardinality constraints on any of the entity types E participating in \\nR is 1, then the primary key of S should not include the foreign key attribute that \\nreferences the relation E′ corresponding to E (see the discussion in Section 3.9.2 \\nconcerning constraints on n-ary relationships).\\nConsider the ternary relationship type \\nSUPPLY  in Figure 3.17, which relates a \\nSUPPLIER s, PART p, and PROJECT j whenever s is currently supplying p to j; this \\ncan be mapped to the relation SUPPLY  shown in Figure 9.4, whose primary key is the \\ncombination of the three foreign keys { Sname , Part_no , Proj_name }.\\n9.1.2  Discussion and Summary of Mapping  \\nfor ER Model Constructs\\nTable 9.1 summarizes the correspondences between ER and relational model con-\\nstructs and constraints.\\nSUPPLIER\\nSname\\nPROJECT\\nProj_name\\nSUPPLY\\nSname Proj_name Part_no QuantityPART\\nPart_no. . .\\n. . .\\n. . .Figure 9.4 \\nMapping the n-ary  \\nrelationship type  SUPPLY from  Figure 3.17(a).'),\n",

By \\nusing the \\nEQUIJOIN  operation (or NATURAL JOIN  if the two join attributes have \\nthe same name) over S.A and T.B, we can combine all pairs of related tuples \\nfrom S and T and materialize the relationship. When a binary 1:1 or 1:N rela-\\ntionship type is involved and the foreign key mapping is used, a single join \\noperation is usually needed. When the relationship relation approach is used, \\nsuch as for a binary M:N relationship type, two join operations are needed, \\nwhereas for n-ary relationship types, n joins are needed to fully materialize the \\nrelationship instances.\\nFor example, to form a relation that includes the employee name, project name, \\nand hours that the employee works on each project, we need to connect  each \\nEMPLOYEE  tuple to the related PROJECT  tuples via the WORKS_ON   \\nrelation in Figure 9.2. Hence, we must apply the EQUIJOIN  operation to  \\nthe EMPLOYEE  and WORKS_ON  relations with the join condition  \\nEMPLOYEE. Ssn = WORKS_ON. Essn , and then apply another EQUIJOIN  opera-\\ntion to the resulting relation and the PROJECT  relation with join condition \\nWORKS_ON. Pno = PROJECT. Pnumber . In general, when multiple relationships \\nneed to be traversed, numerous join operations must be specified. The user must always be aware of the foreign key attributes in order to use them cor-rectly in combining related tuples from two or more relations. This is some-times considered to be a drawback of the relational data model, because the foreign key/primary key correspondences are not always obvious upon inspec-tion of relational schemas. If an \\nEQUIJOIN  is performed among attributes of two \\nrelations that do not represent a foreign key/primary key relationship, the result can often be meaningless and may lead to spurious data. For example, the reader can try joining the \\nPROJECT  and DEPT_LOCATIONS  relations on the con-\\ndition Dlocation  = Plocation  and examine the result.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 328}, page_content='298 Chapter 9 Relational Database Design by ER- and EER-to-Relational Mapping\\nIn the relational schema we create a separate relation for each  multivalued attribute. \\nFor a particular entity with a set of values for the multivalued attribute, the key attribute value of the entity is repeated once for each value of the multivalued attri-bute in a separate tuple because the basic relational model does not allow multiple \\nvalues (a list, or a set of values) for an attribute in a single tuple. For example, because department 5 has three locations, three tuples exist in the \\nDEPT_LOCATIONS  \\nrelation in Figure 3.6; each tuple specifies one of the locations. In our example, we apply \\nEQUIJOIN  to DEPT_LOCATIONS  and DEPARTMENT  on the Dnumber  attribute to \\nget the values of all locations along with other DEPARTMENT  attributes. In the result-\\ning relation, the values of the other DEPARTMENT  attributes are repeated in separate \\ntuples for every location that a department has.\\nThe basic relational algebra does not have a NEST  or COMPRESS  operation that \\nwould produce a set of tuples of the form {<‘1’, ‘Houston’>, <‘4’, ‘Stafford’>, <‘5’, {‘Bellaire’, ‘Sugarland’, ‘Houston’}>} from the \\nDEPT_LOCATIONS  relation in Figure 3.6. \\nThis is a serious drawback of the basic normalized or flat version of the relational \\nmodel. The object data model and object-relational systems (see Chapter 12) do \\nallow multivalued attributes by using the array type for the attribute.\\n9.2  Mapping EER Model Constructs  \\nto Relations\\nIn this section, we discuss the mapping of EER model constructs to relations by \\nextending the ER-to-relational mapping algorithm that was presented in Sec-tion 9.1.1.\\n9.2.1 Mapping of Specialization or Generalization\\nThere are several options for mapping a number of subclasses that together form a specialization (or alternatively, that are generalized into a superclass), such as the {\\nSECRETARY , TECHNICIAN , ENGINEER } subclasses of EMPLOYEE  in Figure 4.4. The \\ntwo main options are to map the whole specialization into a single table , or to map \\nit into multiple tables . Within each option are variations that depend on the con-\\nstraints on the specialization/generalization.\\nWe can add a further step to our ER-to-relational mapping algorithm from Sec- \\ntion 9.1.1, which has seven steps, to handle the mapping of specialization. Step 8, which follows, gives the most common options; other mappings are also possible. We discuss the conditions under which each option should be used. We use Attrs( R) \\nto denote the attributes of a relation R , and PK( R) to denote the primary key of R . \\nFirst we describe the mapping formally, then we illustrate it with examples.\\nStep 8: Options for Mapping Specialization or Generalization. Convert \\neach specialization with m subclasses { S\\n1, S2, … , Sm} and (generalized) super- \\nclass C, where the attributes of C are { k, a1, … , an} and k is the (primary) key, into \\nrelation schemas using one of the following options:'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 329}, page_content='9.2 Mapping EER Model Constructs to Relations  299\\n ■Option 8A: Multiple relations—superclass and subclasses.  Create a  \\nrelation L for C with attributes Attrs( L) = { k, a1, … , an} and PK( L) = k.  \\nCreate a relation Li for each subclass Si, 1 ≤ i ≤ m, with the attributes  \\nAttrs( Li) = { k} ∪ {attributes of Si} and PK( Li) = k. This option works for any \\nspecialization (total or partial, disjoint or overlapping).\\n ■Option 8B: Multiple relations—subclass relations only.  Create a  \\nrelation Li for each subclass Si, 1 ≤ i ≤ m, with the attributes  \\nAttrs( Li) = {attributes of Si} ∪ {k, a1, … , an} and PK( Li) = k. This option only \\nworks for a specialization whose subclasses are total  (every entity in the \\nsuperclass must belong to (at least) one of the subclasses). Additionally, it is only recommended if the specialization has the disjointedness constraint  (see \\nSection 4.3.1). If the specialization is overlapping , the same entity may be \\nduplicated in several relations.\\n ■Option 8C: Single relation with one type attribute.  Create a single relation \\nL with attributes Attrs( L) = { k, a1, …, an} ∪ {attributes of S1} ∪ … ∪ {attri-\\nbutes of Sm} ∪ {t} and PK( L) = k. The attribute t is called a type  (or  \\ndiscriminating ) attribute whose value indicates the subclass to which each \\ntuple belongs, if any. This option works only for a specialization whose sub-\\nclasses are disjoint,  and has the potential for generating many NULL  values if \\nmany specific (local) attributes exist in the subclasses.\\n ■Option 8D: Single relation with multiple type attributes.  Create a single \\nrelation schema L with attributes Attrs( L) = { k, a1, …, an} ∪ {attributes \\nof S1} ∪ … ∪ {attributes of Sm} ∪ {t1, t2, …, tm} and PK( L) = k. Each ti,  \\n1 ≤ i ≤ m, is a Boolean type attribute  indicating whether or not a tuple \\nbelongs to subclass Si. This option is used for a specialization whose sub-\\nclasses are overlapping  (but will also work for a disjoint specialization).\\nOptions 8A and 8B are the multiple-relation options , whereas options 8C and 8D are \\nthe single-relation options . Option 8A creates a relation L for the superclass C and its \\nattributes, plus a relation Li for each subclass Si; each Li includes the specific (local) \\nattributes of Si, plus the primary key of the superclass C, which is propagated to Li and \\nbecomes its primary key. It also becomes a foreign key to the superclass relation. An \\nEQUIJOIN  operation on the primary key between any Li and L produces all the specific \\nand inherited attributes of the entities in Si. This option is illustrated in Figure 9.5(a) \\nfor the EER schema in Figure 4.4. Option 8A works for any constraints on the special-ization: disjoint or overlapping, total or partial. Notice that the constraint\\nπ\\n<k>(Li) ⊆ π<k>(L)\\nmust hold for each Li. This specifies a foreign key from each Li to L.\\nIn option 8B, the EQUIJOIN  operation between each subclass and the superclass is \\nbuilt into  the schema and the superclass relation L is done away with, as illustrated \\nin Figure 9.5(b) for the EER specialization in Figure 4.3(b). This option works well only when both  the disjoint and total constraints hold. If the specialization is not \\ntotal, an entity that does not belong to any of the subclasses S\\ni is lost.

The result of the outer union will be similar to \\nthe relations under options 8C and 8D except that the type fields will be missing. When-ever we search for an arbitrary entity in C, we must search all the m relations L\\ni.\\nOptions 8C and 8D create a single relation to represent the superclass C and all its \\nsubclasses. An entity that does not belong to some of the subclasses will have NULL  \\nvalues for the specific (local) attributes of these subclasses. These options are not recommended if many specific attributes are defined for the subclasses. If few local subclass attributes exist, however, these mappings are preferable to options 8A  and 8B because they do away with the need to specify \\nJOIN  operations; therefore, \\nthey can yield a more efficient implementation for queries.\\nOption 8C is used to handle disjoint subclasses by including a single type  (or image  \\nor discriminating ) attribute  t to indicate to which of the m subclasses each tuple \\nbelongs; hence, the domain of t could be {1, 2, … , m}. If the specialization is partial, t \\ncan have NULL  values in tuples that do not belong to any subclass. If the specialization \\nis attribute-defined, that attribute itself serves the purpose of t and t is not needed; this \\noption is illustrated in Figure 9.5(c) for the EER specialization in Figure 4.4.\\nOption 8D is designed to handle overlapping subclasses by including m Boolean  \\ntype  (or flag) fields, one for each  subclass.

A \\ncategory (or union type) is a subclass of the union  of two or more superclasses \\nthat can have different keys because they can be of different entity types (see Sec-tion 4.4). An example is the \\nOWNER  category shown in Figure 4.8, which is a \\nsubset of the union of three entity types PERSON , BANK , and COMPANY . The \\nother category in that figure, REGISTERED_VEHICLE , has two superclasses that \\nhave the same key attribute.\\nStep 9: Mapping of Union Types (Categories). For mapping a category whose \\ndefining superclasses have different keys, it is customary to specify a new key attri-bute, called a surrogate key , when creating a relation to correspond to the union \\ntype. The keys of the defining classes are different, so we cannot use any one of them exclusively to identify all entities in the relation. In our example in Figure 4.8, we create a relation \\nOWNER  to correspond to the OWNER  category, as illustrated in \\nFigure 9.7, and include any attributes of the category in this relation. The primary key of the \\nOWNER  relation is the surrogate key, which we called Owner_id .

Notice that if a particular \\nPERSON  (or BANK  or COMPANY ) entity is not a member of OWNER , it \\nwould have a NULL  value for its Owner_id  attribute in its corresponding tuple in the \\nPERSON  (or BANK  or COMPANY ) relation, and it would not have a tuple in the \\nOWNER  relation. It is also recommended to add a type attribute (not shown in Fig-\\nure 9.7) to the OWNER  relation to indicate the particular entity type to which each \\ntuple belongs ( PERSON  or BANK  or COMPANY ).\\nFor a category whose superclasses have the same key, such as VEHICLE  in Figure 4.8, \\nthere is no need for a surrogate key. The mapping of the REGISTERED_VEHICLE  \\ncategory, which illustrates this case, is also shown in Figure 9.7.\\n9.3 Summary\\nIn Section 9.1, we showed how a conceptual schema design in the ER model can be mapped to a relational database schema. An algorithm for ER-to-relational mapping was given and illustrated by examples from the \\nCOMPANY  database. \\nTable 9.1 summarized the correspondences between the ER and relational model constructs and constraints.

We described the SQL statements for data definition, schema modifica-tion, queries, views, and updates. We also described how various constraints on the database contents, such as key and referential integrity constraints, are specified.\\nIn this chapter and the next, we discuss some of the methods that have been devel-\\noped for accessing databases from programs. Most database access in practical applications is accomplished through software programs that implement database \\napplications . This software is usually developed in a general-purpose program-\\nming language such as Java, C/C++/C#, COBOL (historically), or some other pro-gramming language. In addition, many scripting languages, such as PHP, Python, and JavaScript, are also being used for programming of database access within Web applications. In this chapter, we focus on how databases can be accessed from the traditional programming languages C/C++ and Java, whereas in the next chapter we introduce how databases are accessed from scripting languages such as PHP. Recall from Section 2.3.1 that when database statements are included in a program, the general-purpose programming language is called the host language , whereas the \\ndatabase language—SQL, in our case—is called the data sublanguage . In some \\ncases, special database programming languages  are developed specifically for writ-\\ning database applications. Although many of these were developed as research pro-totypes, some notable database programming languages have widespread use, such as Oracle’s PL/SQL (Programming Language/SQL).\\nIt is important to note that database programming is a very broad topic. There are \\nwhole textbooks devoted to each database programming technique and how that technique is realized in a specific system. New techniques are developed all the chapter 10'),\n",

An additional difficulty in presenting this topic is that although there are SQL standards, these standards themselves are continually evolving, and each DBMS vendor may have some variations from the standard. Because of this, we have chosen to give an introduction to some of the main types of database pro-gramming techniques and to compare these techniques, rather than study one par-ticular method or system in detail. The examples we give serve to illustrate the main differences that a programmer would face when using each of these database pro-gramming techniques. We will try to use the SQL standards in our examples rather than describe a specific system. When using a specific system, the materials in this chapter can serve as an introduction, but should be augmented with the system manuals or with books describing the specific system.\\nWe start our presentation of database programming in Section 10.1 with an over-\\nview of the different techniques developed for accessing a database from programs. Then, in Section 10.2, we discuss the rules for embedding SQL statements into a general-purpose programming language, generally known as embedded SQL . This \\nsection also briefly discusses dynamic SQL , in which queries can be dynamically \\nconstructed at runtime, and presents the basics of the SQLJ variation of embedded SQL that was developed specifically for the programming language Java. In Sec-tion 10.3, we discuss the technique known as SQL/CLI  (Call Level Interface), in which \\na library of procedures and functions is provided for accessing the database. Various sets of library functions have been proposed. The SQL/CLI set of functions is the one given in the SQL standard. Another widely used library of functions is ODBC  \\n(Open Data Base Connectivity), which has many similarities to SQL/CLI; in fact, SQL/CLI can be thought of as the standardized version of ODBC. A third library of classes—which we do describe—is JDBC ; this was developed specifically for access-\\ning databases from the Java object-oriented programming language (OOPL). In OOPL, a library of classes is used instead of a library of functions and procedures, and each class has its own operations and functions. In Section 10.4 we discuss SQL/PSM  (Persistent Stored Modules), which is a part of the SQL standard that \\nallows program modules—procedures and functions—to be stored by the DBMS and accessed through SQL; this also specifies a procedural database programming \\nlanguage  for writing the persistent stored modules. We briefly compare the three \\napproaches to database programming in Section 10.5, and provide a chapter sum-mary in Section 10.6.\\n10.1  Overview of Database Programming \\nTechniques and Issues\\nWe now turn our attention to the techniques that have been developed for access-\\ning databases from programs and, in particular, to the issue of how to access SQL \\ndatabases from application programs. Our presentation of SQL in Chapters 6 and 7 \\nfocused on the language constructs for various database operations—from schema \\ndefinition and constraint specification to querying, updating, and specifying views.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 341}, page_content='10.1 Overview of Database Programming Techniques and Issues  311\\nMost database systems have an interactive interface  where these SQL commands \\ncan be typed directly into a monitor for execution by the database system.  For example, in a computer system where the Oracle RDBMS is installed, the com-mand \\nSQLPLUS  starts the interactive interface. The user can type SQL commands \\nor queries directly over several lines, ended by a semicolon and the Enter key (that is, \\n\";<cr>\" ). Alternatively, a file of commands  can be created and executed \\nthrough the interactive interface by typing @<filename >. The system will execute \\nthe commands written in the file and display the results, if any.\\nThe interactive interface is quite convenient for schema and constraint creation or \\nfor occasional ad hoc queries. However, in practice, the majority of database inter-actions are executed through programs that have been carefully designed and tested. These programs are generally known as application programs  or database \\napplications , and are used as canned transactions  by the end users, as discussed in \\nSection 1.4.3. Another common use of database programming is to access a data-base through an application program that implements a Web interface , for exam-\\nple, when making airline reservations or online purchases. In fact, the vast majority of Web electronic commerce applications include some database access commands. Chapter 11 gives an overview of Web database programming using PHP, a script-ing language that has recently become widely used.\\nIn this section, first we give an overview of the main approaches to database pro-\\ngramming. Then we discuss some of the problems that occur when trying to access a database from a general-purpose programming language, and the typical sequence of commands for interacting with a database from a software program.\\n10.1.1 Approaches to Database Programming\\nSeveral techniques exist for including database interactions in application pro-grams. The main approaches for database programming are the following:\\n  1. Embedding database commands in a general-purpose programming  language.  In this approach, database statements are embedded  into the host \\nprogramming language, but they are identified by a special prefix. For example, the prefix for embedded SQL is the string \\nEXEC SQL , which pre-\\ncedes all SQL commands in a host language program.1 A precompiler  or \\npreproccessor  scans the source program code to identify database state-\\nments and extract them for processing by the DBMS. They are replaced in the program by function calls to the DBMS-generated code. This technique is generally referred to as embedded SQL .\\n  2. Using a library of database functions or classes.  A library of functions is \\nmade available to the host programming language for database calls. For example, there could be functions to connect to a database, prepare a query, execute a query, execute an update, loop over the query result on record at a time, and so on. The actual database query and update commands and any \\n1Other prefixes are sometimes used, but this is the most common.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 342}, page_content='312 Chapter 10 Introduction to SQL Programming Techniques\\nother necessary information are included as parameters in the function calls. \\nThis approach provides what is known as an application programming \\ninterface  (API ) for accessing a database from application programs. For \\nobject-oriented programming languages (OOPLs), a class library  is used. \\nFor example, Java has the JDBC class library, which can generate various types of objects such as: connection objects to a particular database, query objects, and query result objects. Each type of object has a set of operations associated with the class corresponding to the object.\\n  3. Designing a brand-new language.  A database programming language  is \\ndesigned from scratch to be compatible with the database model and query language. Additional programming structures such as loops and conditional statements are added to the database language to convert it into a full-fledged programming language. An example of this approach is Oracle’s PL/SQL. The SQL standard has the SQL/PSM language for specifying stored procedures.\\nIn practice, the first two approaches are more common, since many applications \\nare already written in general-purpose programming languages but require some database access. The third approach is more appropriate for applications that have intensive database interaction. One of the main problems with the first two approaches is impedance mismatch , which does not occur in the third approach.\\n10.1.2 Impedance Mismatch\\nImpedance mismatch  is the term used to refer to the problems that occur because \\nof differences between the database model and the programming language model. \\nFor example, the practical relational model has three main constructs: columns \\n(attributes) and their data types, rows (also referred to as tuples or records), and tables (sets or multisets of records). The first problem that may occur is that the data types of the programming language  differ from the attribute data types  that are \\navailable in the data model. Hence, it is necessary to have a binding  for each host \\nprogramming language that specifies for each attribute type the compatible pro-\\ngramming language types. A different binding is needed for each programming lan-\\nguage  because different languages have different data types. For example, the data \\ntypes available in C/C++ and Java are different, and both differ from the SQL data types, which are the standard data types for relational databases.\\nAnother problem occurs because the results of most queries are sets or multisets of \\ntuples (rows), and each tuple is formed of a sequence of attribute values. In the pro-gram, it is often necessary to access the individual data values within individual tuples for printing or processing. Hence, a binding is needed to map the query result \\ndata structure , which is a table, to an appropriate data structure in the program-\\nming language. A mechanism is needed to loop over the tuples in a query result  in \\norder to access a single tuple at a time and to extract individual values from the tuple. The extracted attribute values are typically copied to appropriate program variables for further processing by the program. A cursor  or iterator variable  is \\ntypically used to loop over the tuples in a query result. Individual values within each tuple are then extracted into distinct program variables of the appropriate type.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 343}, page_content='10.1 Overview of Database Programming Techniques and Issues  313\\nImpedance mismatch is less of a problem when a special database programming \\nlanguage is designed that uses the same data model and data types as the database model. One example of such a language is Oracle’s PL/SQL. The SQL standard also has a proposal for such a database programming language, known as SQL/PSM . For \\nobject databases, the object data model (see Chapter 12) is quite similar to the data model of the Java programming language, so the impedance mismatch is greatly reduced when Java is used as the host language for accessing a Java-compatible object database. Several database programming languages have been implemented as research prototypes (see the Selected Bibliography).\\n10.1.3  Typical Sequence of Interaction  \\nin Database Programming\\nWhen a programmer or software engineer writes a program that requires access to \\na database, it is quite common for the program to be running on one computer system while the database is installed on another. Recall from Section 2.5 that a common architecture for database access is the three-tier client/server model, where a top-tier client program  handles display of information on a laptop or \\nmobile device usually as a Web client or mobile app, a middle-tier application  \\nprogram  implements the logic of a business software application but includes some \\ncalls to one or more database servers  at the bottom tier to access or update the \\ndata.\\n2 When writing such an application program, a common sequence of interac-\\ntion is the following:\\n  1. When the application program requires access to a particular database, the program must first establish  or open  a connection  to the database server. \\nTypically, this involves specifying the Internet address (URL) of the machine where the database server is located, plus providing a login account name and password for database access.\\n  2. Once the connection is established, the program can interact with the database by submitting queries, updates, and other database commands. In general, most types of SQL statements can be included in an application program.\\n  3. When the program no longer needs access to a particular database, it should terminate  or close  the connection to the database.\\nA program can access multiple databases if needed. In some database programming \\napproaches, only one connection can be active at a time, whereas in other approaches multiple connections can be established simultaneously.\\nIn the next three sections, we discuss examples of each of the three main approaches \\nto database programming. Section 10.2 describes how SQL is embedded  into a pro-\\ngramming language. Section 10.3 discusses how function calls  and class libraries  are \\nused to access the database using SQL/CLI (similar to ODBC) and JDBC, and Sec-tion 10.4 discusses an extension to SQL called SQL/PSM that allows general-purpose \\n2As we discussed in Section 2.5, there are two-tier and three-tier architectures; to keep our discussion \\nsimple, we will assume a two-tier client/server architecture here.'),\n",

We focus on two languages: C and Java. The examples used with the C language, known as embedded SQL , are \\npresented in Sections 10.2.1 through 10.2.3, and can be adapted to other similar programming languages. The examples using Java, known as SQLJ , are presented \\nin Sections 10.2.4 and 10.2.5. In this embedded approach, the programming lan-guage is called the host language . Most SQL statements—including data or con-\\nstraint definitions, queries, updates, or view definitions—can be embedded in a host language program.\\n10.2.1 Retrieving Single Tuples with Embedded SQL\\nTo illustrate the concepts of embedded SQL, we will use C as the host programming language.\\n4 In a C program, an embedded SQL statement is distinguished from pro-\\ngramming language statements by prefixing it with the keywords EXEC SQL  so that \\na preprocessor  (or precompiler ) can separate embedded SQL statements from the \\nhost language source code. The SQL statements within a program are terminated by a matching \\nEND-EXEC  or by a semicolon (;). Similar rules apply to embedding \\nSQL in other programming languages.\\nWithin an embedded SQL command, the programmer can refer to specially \\ndeclared C program variables; these are called shared variables  because they are \\nused in both the C program and the embedded SQL statements. Shared variables are prefixed by a colon (:) when they appear in an SQL statement . This distin-\\nguishes program variable names from the names of database schema constructs such as attributes (column names) and relations (table names). It also allows pro-gram variables to have the same names as attribute names, since they are distin-guishable by the colon (:) prefix in the SQL statement. Names of database schema constructs—such as attributes and relations—can only be used within the SQL commands, but shared program variables can be used elsewhere in the C program without the colon (:) prefix.\\nSuppose that we want to write C programs to process the \\nCOMPANY  database in \\nFigure 5.5. We need to declare program variables to match the types of the database attributes that the program will process. The programmer can choose the names of the program variables ; they may or may not have names that are identical to their \\n3SQL/PSM illustrates how typical general-purpose programming language constructs—such as loops \\nand conditional structures—can be incorporated into SQL.\\n4Our discussion here also applies to the C++ or C# programming languages, since we do not use any \\nof the object-oriented features, but focus on the database programming mechanism.'),\n",

We will use the C program variables declared \\nin Figure 10.1 for all our examples and show C program segments without vari-\\nable declarations . Shared variables are declared within a declare section  in the \\nprogram, as shown in Figure 10.1 (lines 1 through 7).5 A few of the common \\nbindings of C types to SQL types are as follows. The SQL types INTEGER , SMALLINT , \\nREAL , and DOUBLE  are mapped to the C data types long , short , float , and \\ndouble , respectively. Fixed-length and varying-length strings ( CHAR [ i],  \\nVARCHAR [ i]) in SQL can be mapped to arrays of characters ( char [i+1],  \\nvarchar [i+1] ) in C that are one character longer than the SQL type because \\nstrings in C are terminated by a NULL  character ( \\\\0), which is not part of the \\ncharacter string itself.6 Although varchar  is not a standard C data type, it is per-\\nmitted when C is used for SQL database programming.\\nNotice that the only embedded SQL commands in Figure 10.1 are lines 1 and 7, \\nwhich tell the precompiler to take note of the C variable names between BEGIN \\nDECLARE  and END DECLARE  because they can be included in embedded SQL state-\\nments—as long as they are preceded by a colon (:). Lines 2 through 5 are regular C program declarations. The C program variables declared in lines 2 through 5 cor-respond to the attributes of the \\nEMPLOYEE  and DEPARTMENT  tables from the \\nCOMPANY  database in Figure 5.5 that was declared by the SQL DDL  in Figure 6.1. \\nThe variables declared in line 6— SQLCODE  and SQLSTATE —are called SQL \\ncommunication variables;  they are used to communicate errors and exception \\nconditions between the database system and the executing program. Line 0 shows a \\nprogram variable loop that will not be used in any embedded SQL statement, so it is \\ndeclared outside the SQL declare section.\\nConnecting to the Database. The SQL command for establishing a connection \\nto a database has the following form:\\nCONNECT TO  <server name> AS <connection name>\\nAUTHORIZATION  <user account name and password> ;\\nIn general, since a user or program can access several database servers, several con-\\nnections can be established, but only one connection can be active at any point in \\n5We use line numbers in our code segments for easy reference; these numbers are not part of the \\nactual code.\\n6SQL strings can also be mapped to char* types in C.0) int loop ;\\n1) EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION ;2) varchar dname [16], fname [16], lname [16], address [31] ;3) char ssn [10], bdate [11], sex [2], minit [2] ;4) float salary, raise ;5) int dno, dnumber ;6) int SQLCODE ; char SQLSTATE [6] ;7) EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION ;Figure 10.1 \\nC program variables used in the  embedded SQL examples E1 and E2.'),\n",

The programmer or user can use the <connection name> to change from the \\ncurrently active connection to a different one by using the following command:\\nSET CONNECTION  <connection name> ;\\nOnce a connection is no longer needed, it can be terminated by the following \\ncommand:\\nDISCONNECT  <connection name> ;\\nIn the examples in this chapter, we assume that the appropriate connection has \\nalready been established to the COMPANY  database, and that it is the currently \\nactive connection.\\nCommunication variables SQLCODE and SQLSTATE. The two special  \\ncommunication variables  that are used by the DBMS to communicate exception \\nor error conditions to the program are SQLCODE  and SQLSTATE . The SQLCODE  \\nvariable shown in Figure 10.1 is an integer variable. After each database command is executed, the DBMS returns a value in \\nSQLCODE . A value of 0 indicates that the \\nstatement was executed successfully by the DBMS. If SQLCODE  > 0 (or, more spe-\\ncifically, if SQLCODE  = 100), this indicates that no more data (records) are available \\nin a query result. If SQLCODE  < 0, this indicates some error has occurred. In some \\nsystems—for example, in the Oracle RDBMS— SQLCODE  is a field in a record \\nstructure called SQLCA  (SQL communication area), so it is referenced as  \\nSQLCA.SQLCODE . In this case, the definition of SQLCA  must be included in the C \\nprogram by including the following line:\\nEXEC SQL include SQLCA ;\\nIn later versions of the SQL standard, a communication variable called SQLSTATE  \\nwas added, which is a string of five characters. A value of ‘00000’ in SQLSTATE  indi-\\ncates no error or exception; other values indicate various errors or exceptions. For \\nexample, ‘02000’ indicates ‘no more data’ when using SQLSTATE . Currently, both \\nSQLSTATE  and SQLCODE  are available in the SQL standard. Many of the error and \\nexception codes returned in SQLSTATE  are supposed to be standardized for all SQL \\nvendors and platforms,7 whereas the codes returned in SQLCODE  are not stan-\\ndardized but are defined by the DBMS vendor. Hence, it is generally better to use \\nSQLSTATE  because this makes error handling in the application programs indepen-\\ndent of a particular DBMS. As an exercise, the reader should rewrite the examples given later in this chapter using \\nSQLSTATE  instead of SQLCODE .\\nExample of Embedded SQL Programming. Our first example to illustrate \\nembedded SQL programming is a repeating program segment (loop) that takes as \\ninput a Social Security number of an employee and prints some information from the corresponding \\nEMPLOYEE  record in the database. The C program code is shown \\nas program segment E1 in Figure 10.2. The program reads (inputs) an Ssn value \\n7In particular, SQLSTATE codes starting with the characters 0 through 4 or A through H are supposed to \\nbe standardized, whereas other values can be implementation-defined.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 347}, page_content='10.2 Embedded SQL, Dynamic SQL, and SQL J  317\\nand then retrieves the EMPLOYEE  tuple with that Ssn from the database via the \\nembedded SQL command. The INTO  clause (line 5) specifies the program vari-\\nables into which attribute values from the database record are retrieved. C program variables in the \\nINTO  clause are prefixed with a colon ( :), as we discussed earlier. \\nThe INTO  clause can be used in this manner only when the query result is a single \\nrecord ; if multiple records are retrieved, an error will be generated. We will see how \\nmultiple records are handled in Section 10.2.2.\\nLine 7 in E1 illustrates the communication between the database and the program \\nthrough the special variable SQLCODE . If the value returned by the DBMS in \\nSQLCODE  is 0, the previous statement was executed without errors or exception \\nconditions. Line 7 checks this and assumes that if an error occurred, it was because no \\nEMPLOYEE  tuple existed with the given Ssn; therefore it outputs a message to \\nthat effect (line 8).\\nWhen a single record is retrieved as in example E1, the programmer can assign its \\nattribute values directly to C program variables in the INTO  clause, as in line 5. In \\ngeneral, an SQL query can retrieve many tuples. In that case, the C program will typically loop through the retrieved tuples and process them one at a time. The con-cept of a cursor  is used to allow tuple-at-a-time processing of a query result by the \\nhost language program. We describe cursors next.\\n10.2.2 Processing Query Results Using Cursors\\nA cursor  is a variable that refers to a single tuple  (row) from a query result  that \\nretrieves a collection of tuples. It is used to loop over the query result, one record at \\na time. The cursor is declared when the SQL query is declared . Later in the pro-\\ngram, an OPEN CURSOR  command fetches the query result from the database and \\nsets the cursor to a position before the first row  in the result of the query. This \\nbecomes the current row  for the cursor. Subsequently, FETCH  commands are \\nissued in the program; each FETCH  moves the cursor to the next row  in the result of \\nthe query, making it the current row and copying its attribute values into the C \\n(host language) program variables specified in the FETCH  command by an INTO     //Program Segment E1:\\n0) loop = 1 ;1) while (loop) {2)   prompt(\"Enter a Social Security Number: \", ssn) ;3)   EXEC SQL4)     SELECT Fname, Minit, Lname, Address, Salary5)     INTO :fname, :minit, :lname, :address, :salary6)     FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE Ssn = :ssn ;7)   if (SQLCODE = = 0) printf(fname, minit, lname, address, salary)8)     else printf(\"Social Security Number does not exist: \", ssn) ;9)   prompt(\"More Social Security Numbers (enter 1 for Yes, 0 for No): \", loop) ;10)  }Figure 10.2 \\nProgram segment E1, a C program segment with embedded SQL.'),\n",

The cursor variable is basically an iterator  that iterates (loops) over the \\ntuples in the query result—one tuple at a time.\\nTo determine when all the tuples in the result of the query have been processed, the \\ncommunication variable SQLCODE  (or, alternatively, SQLSTATE ) is checked. If a \\nFETCH  command is issued that results in moving the cursor past the last tuple in the \\nresult of the query, a positive value ( SQLCODE  > 0) is returned in SQLCODE , \\nindicating that no data (tuple) was found (or the string ‘02000’ is returned in \\nSQLSTATE ). The programmer uses this to terminate the loop over the tuples in the \\nquery result. In general, numerous cursors can be opened at the same time. A \\nCLOSE CURSOR  command is issued to indicate that we are done with processing \\nthe result of the query associated with that cursor.\\nAn example of using cursors to process a query result with multiple records is shown \\nin Figure 10.3, where a cursor called EMP  is declared in line 4. The EMP  cursor  \\nis associated with the SQL query declared in lines 5 through 6, but the query  is not executed until the \\nOPEN EMP  command (line 8) is processed. The  \\nOPEN  <cursor name> command executes the query and fetches its result as a table \\ninto the program workspace, where the program can loop through the individual \\nrows (tuples) by subsequent FETCH  <cursor name> commands (line 9).

The pro-\\ngram segment in E2 reads (inputs) a department name (line 0), retrieves the matching department number from the database (lines 1 to 3), and then retrieves the employees who work in that department via the declared \\nEMP  cursor. A loop \\n(lines 10 to 18) iterates over each record in the query result, one at a time, and prints the employee name, then reads (inputs) a raise amount for that employee (line 12) and updates the employee’s salary in the database by the raise amount (lines 14 to 16).\\nThis example also illustrates how the programmer can update  database records. \\nWhen a cursor is defined for rows that are to be modified ( updated ), we must add \\nthe clause \\nFOR UPDATE OF  in the cursor declaration and list the names of any attri-\\nbutes that will be updated by the program. This is illustrated in line 7 of code seg-ment E2. If rows are to be deleted , the keywords \\nFOR UPDATE  must be added \\nwithout specifying any attributes. In the embedded UPDATE  (or DELETE ) command, \\nthe condition WHERE CURRENT OF  <cursor name> specifies that the current tuple \\nreferenced by the cursor is the one to be updated (or deleted), as in line 16 of E2.\\nThere is no need to include the FOR UPDATE OF  clause in line 7 of E2 if the results \\nof the query are to be used for retrieval purposes only  (no update or delete).\\nGeneral Options for a Cursor Declaration. Several options can be specified \\nwhen declaring a cursor. The general form of a cursor declaration is as follows:\\nDECLARE  <cursor name> [ INSENSITIVE  ] [ SCROLL  ] CURSOR\\n[ WITH HOLD  ] FOR <query specification>\\n[ ORDER BY  <ordering specification> ]\\n[ FOR READ ONLY  | FOR UPDATE  [ OF <attribute list> ] ] ;\\nWe already briefly discussed the options listed in the last line. The default is that the \\nquery is for retrieval purposes ( FOR READ ONLY ). If some of the tuples in the query \\nresult are to be updated, we need to specify FOR UPDATE OF  <attribute list> and list \\nthe attributes that may be updated. If some tuples are to be deleted, we need to specify \\nFOR UPDATE  without any attributes listed.\\nWhen the optional keyword SCROLL  is specified in a cursor declaration, it is pos-\\nsible to position the cursor in other ways than for purely sequential access. A fetch \\norientation  can be added to the FETCH  command, whose value can be one of NEXT , \\nPRIOR , FIRST , LAST , ABSOLUTE  i, and RELATIVE  i. In the latter two commands, i \\nmust evaluate to an integer value that specifies an absolute tuple position within the \\nquery result (for ABSOLUTE  i), or a tuple position relative to the current cursor \\nposition (for RELATIVE  i). The default fetch orientation, which we used in our \\nexamples, is NEXT . The fetch orientation allows the programmer to move the cursor \\naround the tuples in the query result with greater flexibility, providing random \\naccess by position or access in reverse order. When SCROLL  is specified on the cur-\\nsor, the general form of a FETCH  command is as follows, with the parts in square \\nbrackets being optional:\\nFETCH  [ [ <fetch orientation> ] FROM  ] <cursor name> INTO  <fetch target list>;'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 350}, page_content='320 Chapter 10 Introduction to SQL Programming Techniques\\nThe ORDER BY  clause orders the tuples so that the FETCH  command will fetch them \\nin the specified order. It is specified in a similar manner to the corresponding clause for SQL queries (see Section 6.3.6). The last two options when declaring a cursor (\\nINSENSITIVE  and WITH HOLD ) refer to transaction characteristics of database pro-\\ngrams, which we will discuss in Chapter 20.\\n10.2.3 Specifying Queries at Runtime Using Dynamic SQL\\nIn the previous examples, the embedded SQL queries were written as part of the host program source code. Hence, anytime we want to write a different query, we must modify the program code and go through all the steps involved (compiling, debugging, testing, and so on). In some cases, it is convenient to write a program that can execute different SQL queries or updates (or other operations) dynamically \\nat runtime . For example, we may want to write a program that accepts an SQL \\nquery typed from the monitor, executes it, and displays its result, such as the inter-active interfaces available for most relational DBMSs. Another example is when a user-friendly interface generates SQL queries dynamically for the user based on user input through a Web interface or mobile App. In this section, we give a brief overview of dynamic SQL , which is one technique for writing this type of database \\nprogram, by giving a simple example to illustrate how dynamic SQL can work. In \\nSection 10.3, we will describe another approach for dealing with dynamic queries \\nusing function libraries or class libraries.\\nProgram segment E3 in Figure 10.4 reads a string that is input by the user (that \\nstring should be an SQL update command  in this example) into the string program \\nvariable \\nsqlupdatestring  in line 3. It then prepares  this as an SQL command in \\nline 4 by associating it with the SQL variable sqlcommand . Line 5 then executes  \\nthe command. Notice that in this case no syntax check or other types of checks on the command are possible at compile time , since the SQL command is not \\navailable until runtime. This contrasts with our previous examples of embedded SQL, where the query could be checked at compile time because its text was in the program source code.\\nIn E3, the reason for separating \\nPREPARE  and EXECUTE  is that if the command is to \\nbe executed multiple times in a program, it can be prepared only once. Preparing \\nthe command  generally involves syntax and other types of checks by the system, as \\n        //Program Segment E3:\\n0) EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION ;1) varchar sqlupdatestring [256] ;2) EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION ;\\n ...\\n3) prompt(\"Enter the Update Command: \", sqlupdatestring) ;4) EXEC SQL PREPARE sqlcommand FROM :sqlupdatestring ;5) EXEC SQL EXECUTE sqlcommand ;\\n ...Figure 10.4 \\nProgram segment E3, a C program segment that uses dynamic SQL for updating a table.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 351}, page_content='10.2 Embedded SQL, Dynamic SQL, and SQL J  321\\nwell as generating the code for executing it. It is possible to combine the PREPARE  \\nand EXECUTE  commands (lines 4 and 5 in E3) into a single statement by writing\\nEXEC SQL EXECUTE IMMEDIATE :sqlupdatestring ;\\nThis is useful if the command is to be executed only once. Alternatively, the pro-grammer can separate the two statements to catch any errors after the \\nPREPARE  \\nstatement as in E3.\\nAlthough including a dynamic update command  is relatively straightforward in \\ndynamic SQL, a dynamic retrieval query  is much more complicated. This is because \\nthe programmer does not know the types or the number of attributes to be retrieved by the SQL query when writing the program. A complex data structure is needed to allow for different numbers and types of attributes in the query result if no prior information is known about the dynamic query. Techniques similar to those that we shall discuss in Section 10.3 can be used to assign retrieval query results (and query parameters) to host program variables.\\n10.2.4 SQLJ: Embedding SQL Commands in Java\\nIn the previous subsections, we gave an overview of how SQL commands can be embedded in a traditional programming language, using the C language in our examples. We now turn our attention to how SQL can be embedded in an object-oriented programming language,\\n8 in particular, the Java language. SQLJ is a stan-\\ndard that has been adopted by several vendors for embedding SQL in Java. Historically, SQLJ was developed after JDBC, which is used for accessing SQL data-bases from Java using class libraries and function calls. We discuss JDBC in Sec-tion 10.3.2. In this section, we focus on SQLJ as it is used in the Oracle RDBMS. An SQLJ translator will generally convert SQL statements into Java, which can then be executed through the JDBC interface. Hence, it is necessary to install a JDBC driver  \\nwhen using SQLJ.\\n9 In this section, we focus on how to use SQLJ concepts to write \\nembedded SQL in a Java program.\\nBefore being able to process SQLJ with Java in Oracle, it is necessary to import several \\nclass libraries, shown in Figure 10.5. These include the JDBC and IO classes (lines 1 and 2), plus the additional classes listed in lines 3, 4, and 5. In addition, the program must first connect to the desired database using the function call \\ngetConnection , \\nwhich is one of the methods of the oracle  class in line 5 of Figure 10.5. The format of \\nthis function call, which returns an object of type default context ,10 is as follows:\\npublic static DefaultContext\\ngetConnection(String url, String user, String password,\\n         Boolean autoCommit)\\nthrows SQLException ;\\n8This section assumes familiarity with object-oriented concepts (see Chapter 12) and basic Java concepts.\\n9We discuss JDBC drivers in Section 10.3.2.\\n10A default context , when set, applies to subsequent commands in the program until it is changed.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 352}, page_content='322 Chapter 10 Introduction to SQL Programming Techniques\\nFor example, we can write the statements in lines 6 through 8 in Figure 10.5 to  \\nconnect to an Oracle database located at the url <url name> using the login of \\n<user name> and <password> with automatic commitment of each command,11 \\nand then set this connection as the default context  for subsequent commands.\\nIn the following examples, we will not show complete Java classes or programs \\nsince it is not our intention to teach Java. Rather, we will show program segments that illustrate the use of SQLJ. Figure 10.6 shows the Java program variables used in our examples. Program segment J1 in Figure 10.7 reads an employee’s \\nSsn and \\nprints some of the employee’s information from the database.\\nNotice that because Java already uses the concept of exceptions  for error han-\\ndling, a special exception called SQLException  is used to return errors or \\nexception conditions after executing an SQL database command. This plays a similar role to \\nSQLCODE  and SQLSTATE  in embedded SQL. Java has many types \\nof predefined exceptions. Each Java operation (function) must specify the exceptions that can be thrown —that is, the exception conditions that may \\noccur while executing the Java code of that operation. If a defined exception occurs, the system transfers control to the Java code specified for exception handling. In J1, exception handling for an \\nSQLException  is specified in lines 7 \\nand 8. In Java, the following structure\\ntry {<operation>} catch (<exception>) {<exception handling \\n  code>} <continuation code>1) import java.sql.* ;\\n2) import java.io.* ;3) import sqlj.runtime.* ;4) import sqlj.runtime.ref.* ;5) import oracle.sqlj.runtime.* ;\\n ...\\n6) DefaultContext cntxt = 7) oracle.getConnection(\"<url name>\", \"<user name>\", \"<password>\", true) ;8) DefaultContext.setDefaultContext(cntxt) ; ...Figure 10.5 \\nImporting classes needed for including SQLJ in Java programs in Oracle, and establishing a connection  and default context.\\n11Automatic commitment  roughly means that each command is applied to the database after it is  \\nexecuted. The alternative is that the programmer wants to execute several related database commands and then commit them together. We discuss commit concepts in Chapter 20 when we describe database transactions.1) string dname, ssn , fname, fn, lname, ln,  \\nbdate, address ;\\n2) char sex, minit, mi ;3) double salary, sal ;4) integer dno, dnumber ;Figure 10.6 \\nJava program variables  used in SQLJ examples  J1 and J2.'),\n",

If \\nno exception occurs, the < continuation code > is processed directly. Exceptions \\nthat can be thrown by the code in a particular operation should be specified as part of the operation declaration or interface —for example, in the following format:\\n<operation return type> <operation name> (<parameters>)\\nthrows SQLException, IOException ;\\nIn SQLJ, the embedded SQL commands within a Java program are preceded by \\n#sql , as illustrated in J1 line 3, so that they can be identified by the preprocessor. \\nThe #sql  is used instead of the keywords EXEC SQL  that are used in embedded SQL \\nwith the C programming language (see Section 10.2.1). SQLJ uses an INTO  clause—\\nsimilar to that used in embedded SQL—to return the attribute values retrieved from the database by an SQL query into Java program variables. The program variables are preceded by colons (:) in the SQL statement, as in embedded SQL.\\nIn J1 a single tuple  is retrieved by the embedded SQLJ query; that is why we are able \\nto assign its attribute values directly to Java program variables in the \\nINTO  clause in \\nline 4 in Figure 10.7. For queries that retrieve many tuples, SQLJ uses the concept of an iterator , which is similar to a cursor in embedded SQL.\\n10.2.5 Processing Query Results in SQLJ Using Iterators\\nIn SQLJ, an iterator  is a type of object associated with a collection (set or multiset) \\nof records in a query result .12 The iterator is associated with the tuples and attri-\\nbutes that appear in a query result. There are two types of iterators:\\n  1. A named iterator  is associated with a query result by listing the attribute names \\nand types  that appear in the query result. The attribute names must correspond \\nto appropriately declared Java program variables, as shown in Figure 10.6.\\n  2. A positional iterator  lists only the attribute types  that appear in the query \\nresult.         //Program Segment J1:\\n  1) ssn = readEntry(\"Enter a Social Security Number: \") ;\\n  2) try {\\n  3)   #sql { SELECT Fname, Minit, Lname, Address, Salary\\n  4)     INTO :fname, :minit, :lname, :address, :salary\\n  5)     FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE Ssn = :ssn} ;\\n  6) } catch (SQLException se) {\\n  7)     System.out.println(\"Social Security Number does not exist: \" + ssn) ;\\n  8)     Return ;\\n  9)   }\\n10) System.out.println(fname + \" \" + minit + \" \" + lname + \" \" + address  \\n  + \" \" + salary)Figure 10.7 \\nProgram segment J1, a Java program  segment with SQLJ.\\n12We shall discuss iterators in more detail in Chapter 12 when we present object database concepts.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 354}, page_content='324 Chapter 10 Introduction to SQL Programming Techniques\\nIn both cases, the list should be in the same order  as the attributes that are listed in \\nthe SELECT  clause of the query. However, looping over a query result is different for \\nthe two types of iterators. First, we show an example of using a named  iterator in \\nFigure 10.8, program segment J2A. Line 9 in Figure 10.8 shows how a named itera-\\ntor type  Emp is declared. Notice that the names of the attributes in a named iterator \\ntype must match the names of the attributes in the SQL query result. Line 10 shows how an iterator object  \\ne of type Emp is created in the program and then associated \\nwith a query (lines 11 and 12).\\nWhen the iterator object is associated with a query (lines 11 and 12 in Figure 10.8), \\nthe program fetches the query result from the database and sets the iterator to a position before the first row  in the result of the query. This becomes the current row  \\nfor the iterator. Subsequently, next  operations are issued on the iterator object; \\neach \\nnext  moves the iterator to the next row  in the result of the query, making it the \\ncurrent row. If the row exists, the operation retrieves the attribute values for that row into the corresponding program variables. If no more rows exist, the \\nnext  \\noperation returns NULL , and can thus be used to control the looping. Notice that the \\nnamed iterator does not need  an INTO  clause, because the program variables corre-\\nsponding to the retrieved attributes are already specified when the iterator type is \\ndeclared (line 9 in Figure 10.8).\\nIn Figure 10.8, the command (e.next())  in line 13 performs two functions: It \\ngets the next tuple in the query result and controls the WHILE  loop. Once the \\nFigure 10.8 \\nProgram segment J2A, a Java program segment that uses a named iterator to print employee information in a particular department.\\n    //Program Segment J2A:\\n 0) dname = readEntry(\"Enter the Department Name: \") ; 1) try { 2)   #sql { SELECT Dnumber INTO :dnumber 3)     FROM DEPARTMENT WHERE Dname = :dname} ; 4) } catch (SQLException se) { 5)   System.out.println(\"Department does not exist: \" + dname) ; 6)   Return ; 7)   } 8) System.out.printline(\"Employee information for Department: \" + dname) ; 9) #sql iterator Emp(String ssn, String fname, String minit, String lname,      double salary) ;10) Emp e = null ;11) #sql e = { SELECT ssn, fname, minit, lname, salary12)   FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE Dno = :dnumber} ;13) while (e.next()) {14)   System.out.printline(e.ssn + \" \" + e.fname + \" \" + e.minit + \" \" +  \\n    e.lname  + \" \" + e.salary) ;\\n15) } ;16) e.close() ;'),\n",

Line 9 in Figure 10.9 shows how a positional iterator type  \\nEmppos  is declared. The main difference between this and the named iterator is that \\nthere are no attribute names (corresponding to program variable names) in the positional iterator—only attribute types. This can provide more flexibility, but it makes the processing of the query result slightly more complex. The attribute types must still be compatible with the attribute types in the SQL query result and in the same order. Line 10 shows how a positional iterator object  \\ne of type Emppos  is cre-\\nated in the program and then associated with a query (lines 11 and 12).\\nThe positional iterator behaves in a manner that is more similar to embedded SQL \\n(see Section 10.2.2). A FETCH  <iterator variable > INTO  <program variables > com-\\nmand is needed to get the next tuple in a query result. The first time fetch  is exe-\\ncuted, it gets the first tuple (line 13 in Figure 10.9). Line 16 gets the next tuple until no more tuples exist in the query result. To control the loop, a positional iterator function \\ne.endFetch()  is used. This function is automatically set to a value of \\nTRUE  when the iterator is initially associated with an SQL query (line 11), and is set \\nto FALSE  each time a fetch command returns a valid tuple from the query result. It \\nis set to TRUE  again when a fetch command does not find any more tuples. Line 14 \\nshows how the looping is controlled by negation.\\nFigure 10.9 \\nProgram segment J2B, a Java program segment that uses a positional iterator to print employee information in a particular department.\\n    //Program Segment J2B:\\n 0) dname = readEntry(\"Enter the Department Name: \") ; 1) try { 2)   #sql { SELECT Dnumber INTO :dnumber 3)     FROM DEPARTMENT WHERE Dname = :dname} ; 4) } catch (SQLException se) { 5)   System.out.println(\"Department does not exist: \" + dname) ; 6)   Return ; 7)   } 8) System.out.printline(\"Employee information for Department: \" + dname) ; 9) #sql iterator Emppos(String, String, String, String, double) ;10) Emppos e = null ;11) #sql e = { SELECT ssn, fname, minit, lname, salary12)   FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE Dno = :dnumber} ;13) #sql { FETCH :e INTO :ssn, :fn, :mi, :ln, :sal} ;14) while (!e.endFetch()) {15)   System.out.printline(ssn + \" \" + fn + \" \" + mi + \" \" + ln + \" \" + sal) ;16)   #sql { FETCH :e INTO :ssn, :fn, :mi, :ln, :sal} ;17) } ;18) e.close() ;'),\n",

The use of function calls is a more dynamic  approach for database programming \\nthan embedded SQL. We already saw one dynamic database programming technique—dynamic SQL—in Section 10.2.3. The techniques discussed here provide another \\napproach to dynamic database programming. A library of functions , also known \\nas an application programming interface  (API ), is used to access the database. \\nAlthough this provides more flexibility because no preprocessor is needed, one drawback is that syntax and other checks on SQL commands have to be done at runtime. Another drawback is that it sometimes requires more complex program-ming to access query results because the types and numbers of attributes in a query result may not be known in advance.\\nIn this section, we give an overview of two function call interfaces. We first discuss \\nthe SQL Call Level Interface (SQL/CLI ), which is part of the SQL standard. This \\nwas developed as a standardization of the popular library of functions known as ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) . We use C as the host language in our  \\nSQL/CLI examples. Then we give an overview of JDBC , which is the call function \\ninterface for accessing databases from Java. Although it is commonly assumed that JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity, JDBC is just a registered trademark of Sun Microsystems (now Oracle), not an acronym.\\nThe main advantage of using a function call interface is that it makes it easier \\nto access multiple databases within the same application program, even if they are stored under different DBMS packages. We discuss this further in Sec- tion 10.3.2 when we discuss Java database programming with JDBC, although this advantage also applies to database programming with SQL/CLI and ODBC (see Section 10.3.1).\\n10.3.1  Database Programming with SQL/CLI Using C  \\nas the Host Language\\nBefore using the function calls in SQL/CLI, it is necessary to install the appropriate \\nlibrary packages on the database server. These packages are obtained from the ven-dor of the DBMS being used. We now give an overview of how SQL/CLI can be used in a C program.\\n13 We will illustrate our presentation with the sample program \\nsegment CLI1 shown in Figure 10.10.\\n13Our discussion here also applies to the C++ and C# programming languages, since we do not use \\nany of the object-oriented features but focus on the database programming mechanism.'),\n",

When using SQL/CLI, the SQL statements are dynamically created and \\npassed as string parameters  in the function calls. Hence, it is necessary to keep track \\nof the information about host program interactions with the database in runtime data structures because the database commands are processed at runtime. The information is kept in four types of records, represented as structs  in C data types. \\nAn environment record  is used as a container to keep track of one or more data-\\nbase connections and to set environment information. A connection record  keeps \\ntrack of the information needed for a particular database connection. A statement \\nrecord  keeps track of the information needed for one SQL statement. A  \\ndescription record  keeps track of the information about tuples or parameters—for \\nexample, the number of attributes and their types in a tuple, or the number and \\ntypes of parameters in a function call. This is needed when the programmer does \\nnot know this information about the query when writing the program. In our \\nexamples, we assume that the programmer knows the exact query, so we do not \\nshow any description records.    //Program CLI1:\\n 0) #include sqlcli.h ; 1) void printSal() { 2) SQLHSTMT stmt1 ; 3) SQLHDBC con1 ; 4) SQLHENV env1 ; 5) SQLRETURN ret1, ret2, ret3, ret4 ; 6) ret1 = SQLAllocHandle(SQL_HANDLE_ENV, SQL_NULL_HANDLE, &env1) ; 7) if (!ret1) ret2 = SQLAllocHandle(SQL_HANDLE_DBC, env1, &con1) else exit ; 8) if (!ret2) ret3 = SQLConnect(con1, \"dbs\", SQL_NTS, \"js\", SQL_NTS, \"xyz\",      SQL_NTS) else exit ; 9) if (!ret3) ret4 = SQLAllocHandle(SQL_HANDLE_STMT, con1, &stmt1) else exit ;10) SQLPrepare(stmt1, \"select Lname, Salary from EMPLOYEE where Ssn = ?\",      SQL_NTS) ;11) prompt(\"Enter a Social Security Number: \", ssn) ;12) SQLBindParameter(stmt1, 1, SQL_CHAR, &ssn, 9, &fetchlen1) ;13) ret1 = SQLExecute(stmt1) ;14) if (!ret1) {15)   SQLBindCol(stmt1, 1, SQL_CHAR, &lname, 15, &fetchlen1) ;16)   SQLBindCol(stmt1, 2, SQL_FLOAT, &salary, 4, &fetchlen2) ;17)   ret2 = SQLFetch(stmt1) ;18)   if (!ret2) printf(ssn, lname, salary)19)     else printf(\"Social Security Number does not exist: \", ssn) ;20)   }21) }\\nFigure 10.10 \\nProgram segment CLI1, a C program segment with SQL/CLI.'),\n",

The handle is returned when a record is first created. To cre-\\nate a record and return its handle, the following SQL/CLI function is used:\\nSQLAllocHandle(<handle_type>, <handle_1>, <handle_2>)\\nIn this function, the parameters are as follows:\\n ■<handle_type>  indicates the type of record being created. The possible val-\\nues for this parameter are the keywords SQL_HANDLE_ENV , SQL_HANDLE_DBC , \\nSQL_HANDLE_STMT , or SQL_HANDLE_DESC , for an environment, connec-\\ntion, statement, or description record, respectively.\\n ■<handle_1>  indicates the container within which the new handle is being \\ncreated. For example, for a connection record this would be the environ-ment within which the connection is being created, and for a statement record this would be the connection for that statement.\\n ■<handle_2>  is the pointer (handle) to the newly created record of type \\n<handle_type> .\\nSteps in a database program. When writing a C program that will include \\ndatabase calls through SQL/CLI, the following are the typical steps that are taken. We illustrate the steps by referring to the example CLI1 in Figure 10.10, which reads a Social Security number of an employee and prints the employee’s last name and salary.\\n  1.

A return code of 0 (zero) \\nindicates successful execution  of the function call.\\n  3. Environment record.  An environment record  must be set up in the program \\nusing SQLAllocHandle .

In our example, the database server name we \\nare connecting to is dbs and the account name and password for login are js \\nand xyz, respectively.\\n  5. Statement record.  A statement record  is set up in the program using \\nSQLAllocHandle . In line 9, the statement record created has the handle \\nstmt1  and uses the connection con1 .\\n  6. Preparing an SQL statement and statement parameters.  The SQL state-\\nment is prepared  using the SQL/CLI function SQLPrepare . In line 10, \\nthis assigns the SQL statement string  (the query  in our example) to the \\nstatement handle stmt1 . The question mark ( ?) symbol in line 10 repre-\\nsents a statement parameter , which is a value to be determined at run-\\ntime—typically by binding it to a C program variable. In general, there could be several parameters in a statement string. They are distinguished by the order of appearance of the question marks in the statement string (the first \\n? represents parameter 1, the second ? represents parameter 2, \\nand so on). The last parameter in SQLPrepare  should give the length of \\nthe SQL statement string in bytes, but if we enter the keyword SQL_NTS , \\nthis indicates that the string holding the query is a NULL-terminated \\nstring  so that SQL can calculate the string length automatically. This use \\nof SQL_NTS  also applies to other string parameters  in the function calls in \\nour examples.\\n  7. Binding the statement parameters.  Before executing the query, any param-\\neters in the query string should be bound to program variables using the \\nSQL/CLI function SQLBindParameter . In Figure 10.10, the parameter \\n(indicated by ?) to the prepared query referenced by stmt1  is bound to the \\nC program variable ssn in line 12. If there are n parameters in the SQL state-\\nment, we should have n SQLBindParameter  function calls, each with a dif-\\nferent parameter position  (1, 2, … , n).\\n  8. Executing the statement.  Following these preparations, we can now exe-\\ncute the SQL statement referenced by the handle stmt1  using the func-\\ntion SQLExecute  (line 13). Notice that although the query will be \\nexecuted in line 13, the query results have not yet been assigned to any C \\nprogram variables.\\n  9. Processing the query result.  In order to determine where the result of the \\nquery is returned, one common technique is the bound columns  approach. \\nHere, each column in a query result is bound to a C program variable using the \\nSQLBindCol  function. The columns are distinguished by their order of \\nappearance in the SQL query. In Figure 10.10 lines 15 and 16, the two col-\\numns in the query ( Lname  and Salary ) are bound to the C program vari-\\nables lname  and salary , respectively.15\\n15An alternative technique known as unbound columns  uses different SQL/CLI functions, namely \\nSQLGetCol or SQLGetData, to retrieve columns from the query result without previously binding them; these are applied after the SQLFetch command in line 17 .'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 360}, page_content='330 Chapter 10 Introduction to SQL Programming Techniques\\n 10. Retrieving column values.  Finally, in order to retrieve the column values into \\nthe C program variables, the function SQLFetch  is used (line 17). This func-\\ntion is similar to the FETCH  command of embedded SQL. If a query result has \\na collection of tuples, each SQLFetch  call gets the next tuple and returns its \\ncolumn values into the bound program variables. SQLFetch  returns an excep-\\ntion (nonzero) code if there are no more tuples in the query result.16\\nAs we can see, using dynamic function calls requires a lot of preparation to set up the SQL statements and to bind statement parameters and query results to the appropriate program variables.\\nIn CLI1 a single tuple  is selected by the SQL query. Figure 10.11 shows an example \\nof retrieving multiple tuples. We assume that appropriate C program variables have been declared as in Figure 10.1. The program segment in CLI2 reads (inputs) a \\n16If unbound program variables are used, SQLFetch returns the tuple into a temporary program area. \\nEach subsequent SQLGetCol (or SQLGetData) returns one attribute value in order. Basically, for each row in the query result, the program should iterate over the attribute values (columns) in that row. This is useful if the number of columns in the query result is variable.    //Program Segment CLI2:\\n 0) #include sqlcli.h ; 1) void printDepartmentEmps() { 2) SQLHSTMT stmt1 ; 3) SQLHDBC con1 ; 4) SQLHENV env1 ; 5) SQLRETURN ret1, ret2, ret3, ret4 ; 6) ret1 = SQLAllocHandle(SQL_HANDLE_ENV, SQL_NULL_HANDLE, &env1) ; 7) if (!ret1) ret2 = SQLAllocHandle(SQL_HANDLE_DBC, env1, &con1) else exit ; 8) if (!ret2) ret3 = SQLConnect(con1, \"dbs\", SQL_NTS, \"js\", SQL_NTS, \"xyz\",      SQL_NTS) else exit ; 9) if (!ret3) ret4 = SQLAllocHandle(SQL_HANDLE_STMT, con1, &stmt1) else exit ;10) SQLPrepare(stmt1, \"select Lname, Salary from EMPLOYEE where Dno = ?\",      SQL_NTS) ;11) prompt(\"Enter the Department Number: \", dno) ;12) SQLBindParameter(stmt1, 1, SQL_INTEGER, &dno, 4, &fetchlen1) ;13) ret1 = SQLExecute(stmt1) ;14) if (!ret1) {15)   SQLBindCol(stmt1, 1, SQL_CHAR, &lname, 15, &fetchlen1) ;16)   SQLBindCol(stmt1, 2, SQL_FLOAT, &salary, 4, &fetchlen2) ;17)   ret2 = SQLFetch(stmt1) ;18)   while (!ret2) {19)     printf(lname, salary) ;20)     ret2 = SQLFetch(stmt1) ;21)     }22)   }23) }Figure 10.11 \\nProgram segment CLI2, a C program segment that uses SQL/CLI for a query with a collection of tuples in its result.'),\n",

A loop then iterates over each employee record, one at a time, and prints the employee’s last name and salary.\\n10.3.2 JDBC: SQL Class Library for Java Programming\\nWe now turn our attention to how SQL can be called from the Java object-oriented programming language.\\n17 The class libraries and associated function calls for this \\naccess are known as JDBC .18 The Java programming language was designed to be \\nplatform independent—that is, a program should be able to run on any type of computer system that has a Java interpreter installed. Because of this portability, many RDBMS vendors provide JDBC drivers so that it is possible to access their systems via Java programs.\\nJDBC drivers. A JDBC driver  is basically an implementation of the classes and \\nassociated objects and function calls specified in JDBC for a particular vendor’s RDBMS. Hence, a Java program with JDBC objects and function calls can access any RDBMS that has a JDBC driver available.\\nBecause Java is object-oriented, its function libraries are implemented as classes . \\nBefore being able to process JDBC function calls with Java, it is necessary to import \\nthe JDBC class libraries , which are called \\njava.sql.* . These can be downloaded \\nand installed via the Web.19\\nJDBC is designed to allow a single Java program to connect to several different databases. These are sometimes called the data sources  accessed by the Java pro-\\ngram, and could be stored using RDBMSs from different vendors residing on dif-ferent machines. Hence, different data source accesses within the same Java program may require JDBC drivers from different vendors. To achieve this flexibil-ity, a special JDBC class called the driver manager  class is employed, which keeps \\ntrack of the installed drivers. A driver should be registered  with the driver manager \\nbefore it is used. The operations (methods) of the driver manager class include \\ngetDriver , registerDriver , and deregisterDriver . These can be used to add \\nand remove drivers for different systems dynamically. Other functions set up and close connections to data sources.\\nTo load a JDBC driver explicitly, the generic Java function for loading a class can be \\nused. For example, to load the JDBC driver for the Oracle RDBMS, the following command can be used:\\nClass.forName(\"oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver\")\\n17This section a ssumes familiarity with object-oriented concepts (see Chapter 11) and basic Java concepts.\\n18As we mentioned earlier, JDBC is a registered trademark of Sun Microsystems, although it is commonly \\nthought to be an acronym for Java Database Connectivity.\\n19These are available from several Web sites—for example, at http://industry.java.sun.com/products/\\njdbc/drivers.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 362}, page_content='332 Chapter 10 Introduction to SQL Programming Techniques\\nThis will register the driver with the driver manager and make it available to the \\nprogram. It is also possible to load and register the driver(s) needed in the com-mand line that runs the program, for example, by including the following in the command line:\\n-Djdbc.drivers = oracle.jdbc.driver\\nJDBC programming steps. The following are typical steps that are taken when \\nwriting a Java application program with database access through JDBC function calls. We illustrate the steps by referring to the example JDBC1 in Figure 10.12, which reads a Social Security number of an employee and prints the employee’s last name and salary.\\n  1. Import the JDBC class library.  The JDBC library of classes  must be \\nimported into the Java program. These classes are called java.sql.* , and \\ncan be imported using line 1 in Figure 10.12. Any additional Java class libraries needed by the program must also be imported.\\n    //Program JDBC1:\\n 0) import java.io.* ; 1) import java.sql.*    ... 2) class getEmpInfo { 3)   public static void main (String args []) throws SQLException, IOException { 4)     try { Class.forName(\"oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver\") 5)     } catch (ClassNotFoundException x) { 6)       System.out.println (\"Driver could not be loaded\") ; 7)     } 8)     String dbacct, passwrd, ssn, lname ; 9)     Double salary ;10)     dbacct = readentry(\"Enter database account:\") ;11)     passwrd = readentry(\"Enter password:\") ;12)     Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection13)       (\"jdbc:oracle:oci8:\" + dbacct + \"/\" + passwrd) ;14)     String stmt1 = \"select Lname, Salary from EMPLOYEE where Ssn = ?\" ;15)     PreparedStatement p = conn.prepareStatement(stmt1) ;16)     ssn = readentry(\"Enter a Social Security Number: \") ;17)     p.clearParameters() ;18)     p.setString(1, ssn) ;19)     ResultSet r = p.executeQuery() ;20)     while (r.next()) {21)       lname = r.getString(1) ;22)       salary = r.getDouble(2) ;23)       system.out.printline(lname + salary) ;24)   } }25) }Figure 10.12 \\nProgram segment JDBC1, a Java program segment with JDBC.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 363}, page_content='10.3 Database Programming with Function Calls and Class Libraries: SQL/CLI and JDBC  333\\n  2. Load the JDBC driver.  This is shown in lines 4 to 7. The Java exception in \\nline 5 occurs if the driver is not loaded successfully.\\n  3. Create appropriate variables.  These are the variables needed in the Java \\nprogram (lines 8 and 9).\\n  4. The Connection  object.  A connection object  is created using the  \\ngetConnection  function of the DriverManager  class of JDBC. In lines 12 \\nand 13, the Connection  object is created by using the function call \\ngetConnection(urlstring) , where urlstring  has the form\\njdbc:oracle:<driverType>:<dbaccount>/<password>\\nAn alternative form is\\ngetConnection(url, dbaccount, password)\\nVarious properties can be set for a connection object, but they are mainly related to transactional properties, which we discuss in Chapter 21.\\n  5. The Prepared Statement  object.  A statement object  is created in the pro-\\ngram. In JDBC, there is a basic statement class, Statement , with two spe-\\ncialized subclasses: PreparedStatement  and CallableStatement . The \\nexample in Figure 10.12 illustrates how PreparedStatement  objects are \\ncreated and used. The next example (Figure 10.13) illustrates the other type of \\nStatement  objects. In line 14 in Figure 10.12, a query string with a sin-\\ngle parameter—indicated by the ? symbol—is created in the string variable \\nstmt1 . In line 15, an object p of type PreparedStatement  is created based \\non the query string in stmt1  and using the connection object conn . In gen-\\neral, the programmer should use PreparedStatement  objects if a query is \\nto be executed multiple times , since it would be prepared, checked, and \\ncompiled only once, thus saving this cost for the additional executions of the query.\\n  6. Setting the statement parameters.  The question mark ( ?) symbol in line 14 \\nrepresents a statement parameter , which is a value to be determined at run-\\ntime, typically by binding it to a Java program variable. In general, there \\ncould be several parameters, distinguished by the order of appearance of the question marks within the statement string (first \\n? represents parameter 1, \\nsecond ? represents parameter 2, and so on), as we discussed previously.\\n  7. Binding the statement parameters.  Before executing a PreparedStatement  \\nquery, any parameters should be bound to program variables. Depending \\non the type of the parameter, different functions such as setString , \\nsetInteger , setDouble , and so on are applied to the PreparedStatement  \\nobject to set its parameters. The appropriate function should be used to cor-respond to the data type of the parameter being set. In Figure 10.12, the parameter (indicated by \\n?) in object p is bound to the Java program variable \\nssn in line 18. The function setString  is used because ssn is a string vari-\\nable. If there are n parameters in the SQL statement, we should have n set ...  \\nfunctions, each with a different parameter position (1, 2, … , n). Generally, it \\nis advisable to clear all parameters before setting any new values (line 17).'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 364}, page_content='334 Chapter 10 Introduction to SQL Programming Techniques\\n  8. Executing the SQL statement.  Following these preparations, we can now \\nexecute the SQL statement referenced by the object p using the function \\nexecuteQuery  (line 19). There is a generic function execute  in JDBC,  \\nplus two specialized functions: executeUpdate  and executeQuery .  \\nexecuteUpdate  is used for SQL insert, delete, or update statements, and \\nreturns an integer value indicating the number of tuples that were affected. \\nexecuteQuery  is used for SQL retrieval statements, and returns an object of \\ntype ResultSet , which we discuss next.\\n  9. Processing the ResultSet  object.  In line 19, the result of the query is \\nreturned in an object  r of type ResultSet . This resembles a two-dimensional \\narray or a table, where the tuples are the rows and the attributes returned are the columns. A \\nResultSet  object is similar to a cursor in embedded SQL \\nand an iterator in SQLJ. In our example, when the query is executed, r refers \\nto a tuple before the first tuple in the query result. The r.next()  function \\n(line 20) moves to the next tuple (row) in the ResultSet  object and returns \\nNULL  if there are no more objects. This is used to control the looping. The     //Program Segment JDBC2:\\n 0) import java.io.* ; 1) import java.sql.*    ... 2) class printDepartmentEmps { 3)   public static void main (String args [])          throws SQLException, IOException { 4)     try { Class.forName(\"oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver\") 5)     } catch (ClassNotFoundException x) { 6)       System.out.println (\"Driver could not be loaded\") ; 7)     } 8)     String dbacct, passwrd, lname ; 9)     Double salary ;10)     Integer dno ;11)     dbacct = readentry(\"Enter database account:\") ;12)     passwrd = readentry(\"Enter password:\") ;13)     Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection14)       (\"jdbc:oracle:oci8:\" + dbacct + \"/\" + passwrd) ;15)     dno = readentry(\"Enter a Department Number: \") ;16)     String q = \"select Lname, Salary from EMPLOYEE where Dno = \" +        dno.tostring() ;17)     Statement s = conn.createStatement() ;18)     ResultSet r = s.executeQuery(q) ;19)     while (r.next()) {20)       lname = r.getString(1) ;21)       salary = r.getDouble(2) ;22)       system.out.printline(lname + salary) ;23)   } }24) }Figure 10.13 \\nProgram segment JDBC2, a Java program segment that uses JDBC for a query with a collection of tuples in its result.'),\n",

The programmer can \\neither use the attribute positions (1, 2) or the actual attribute names (\\n\"Lname\" , \"Salary\" ) with the get …  functions. In our examples, we used \\nthe positional notation in lines 21 and 22.\\nIn general, the programmer can check for SQL exceptions after each JDBC function \\ncall. We did not do this to simplify the examples.\\nNotice that JDBC does not distinguish between queries that return single tuples and \\nthose that return multiple tuples, unlike some of the other techniques. This is justi-fiable because a single tuple result set is just a special case.\\nIn example JDBC1, a single tuple  is selected by the SQL query, so the loop in lines 20 \\nto 24 is executed at most once. The example shown in Figure 10.13 illustrates the retrieval of multiple tuples. The program segment in JDBC2 reads (inputs) a depart-ment number and then retrieves the employees who work in that department. A loop then iterates over each employee record, one at a time, and prints the employee’s last name and salary. This example also illustrates how we can execute a query \\ndirectly , without having to prepare it as in the previous example. This technique is \\npreferred for queries that will be executed only once, since it is simpler to program. \\nIn line 17 of Figure 10.13, the programmer creates a Statement  object (instead of \\nPreparedStatement , as in the previous example) without associating it with a \\nparticular query string. The query string q is passed to the statement object  s when \\nit is executed in line 18.\\nThis concludes our brief introduction to JDBC. The interested reader is referred to \\nthe Web site http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/jdbc/, which contains many further details about JDBC.\\n10.4  Database Stored Procedures  \\nand SQL/PS M\\nThis section introduces two additional topics related to database programming. In \\nSection 10.4.1, we discuss the concept of stored procedures, which are program modules that are stored by the DBMS at the database server. Then in Section 10.4.2 we discuss the extensions to SQL that are specified in the standard to include  \\ngeneral-purpose programming constructs in SQL. These extensions are known as \\nSQL/PSM (SQL/Persistent Stored Modules) and can be used to write stored proce-\\ndures. SQL/PSM also serves as an example of a database programming language that extends a database model and language—namely, SQL—with programming language constructs, such as conditional statements and loops.\\n10.4.1 Database Stored Procedures and Functions\\nIn our presentation of database programming techniques so far, there was an \\nimplicit assumption that the database application program was running on a client'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 366}, page_content='336 Chapter 10 Introduction to SQL Programming Techniques\\nmachine, or more likely at the application server computer  in the middle-tier of a \\nthree-tier client-server architecture (see Section 2.5.4 and Figure 2.7). In either case, the machine where the program is executing is different from the machine on which the database server—and the main part of the DBMS software package—is located. Although this is suitable for many applications, it is sometimes useful to create database program modules—procedures or functions—that are stored and exe-cuted by the DBMS at the database server. These are historically known as database stored procedures , although they can be functions or procedures. The term used in \\nthe SQL standard for stored procedures is persistent stored modules  because these \\nprograms are stored persistently by the DBMS, similarly to the persistent data stored by the DBMS.\\nStored procedures are useful in the following circumstances:\\n ■If a database program is needed by several applications, it can be stored at \\nthe server and invoked by any of the application programs. This reduces duplication of effort and improves software modularity.\\n ■Executing a program at the server can reduce data transfer and communica-\\ntion cost between the client and server in certain situations.\\n ■These procedures can enhance the modeling power provided by views by \\nallowing more complex types of derived data to be made available to the \\ndatabase users via the stored procedures. Additionally, they can be used to \\ncheck for complex constraints that are beyond the specification power of \\nassertions and triggers.\\nIn general, many commercial DBMSs allow stored procedures and functions to be \\nwritten in a general-purpose programming language. Alternatively, a stored proce-\\ndure can be made of simple SQL commands such as retrievals and updates. The general form of declaring stored procedures is as follows:\\nCREATE PROCEDURE  <procedure name> (<parameters>)\\n<local declarations>\\n<procedure body> ;\\nThe parameters and local declarations are optional, and are specified only if needed. \\nFor declaring a function, a return type is necessary, so the declaration form is:\\nCREATE FUNCTION  <function name> (<parameters>)\\nRETURNS  <return type>\\n<local declarations>\\n<function body> ;\\nIf the procedure (or function) is written in a general-purpose programming language, \\nit is typical to specify the language as well as a file name where the program code is stored. For example, the following format can be used:\\nCREATE PROCEDURE  <procedure name> (<parameters>)\\nLANGUAGE  <programming language name>\\nEXTERNAL NAME  <file path name> ;'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 367}, page_content='10.4 Database Stored Procedures and SQL/PSM  337\\nIn general, each parameter should have a parameter type  that is one of the SQL \\ndata types. Each parameter should also have a parameter mode , which is one of IN, \\nOUT , or INOUT . These correspond to parameters whose values are input only, out-\\nput (returned) only, or both input and output, respectively.\\nBecause the procedures and functions are stored persistently by the DBMS, it \\nshould be possible to call them from the various SQL interfaces and programming techniques. The \\nCALL  statement  in the SQL standard can be used to invoke a stored \\nprocedure—either from an interactive interface or from embedded SQL or SQLJ. The format of the statement is as follows:\\nCALL  <procedure or function name> (<argument list>) ;\\nIf this statement is called from JDBC, it should be assigned to a statement object of \\ntype CallableStatement  (see Section 10.3.2).\\n10.4.2  SQL/PSM: Extending SQL for Specifying Persistent \\nStored Modules\\nSQL/PSM is the part of the SQL standard that specifies how to write persistent \\nstored modules. It includes the statements to create functions and procedures that we described in the previous section. It also includes additional programming con-structs to enhance the power of SQL for the purpose of writing the code (or body) of stored procedures and functions.\\nIn this section, we discuss the SQL/PSM constructs for conditional (branching) \\nstatements and for looping statements. These will give a flavor of the type of con-structs that SQL/PSM has incorporated;\\n20 then we give an example to illustrate how \\nthese constructs can be used.\\nThe conditional branching statement in SQL/PSM has the following form:\\nIF <condition> THEN  <statement list>\\nELSEIF  <condition> THEN  <statement list>\\n…\\nELSEIF  <condition> THEN  <statement list>\\nELSE  <statement list>\\nEND IF  ;\\nConsider the example in Figure 10.14, which illustrates how the conditional branch \\nstructure can be used in an SQL/PSM function. The function returns a string value (line 1) describing the size of a department within a company based on the number of employees. There is one IN integer parameter, \\ndeptno , which gives a depart-\\nment number. A local variable NoOfEmps  is declared in line 2. The query in lines 3 \\nand 4 returns the number of employees in the department, and the conditional \\n20We only give a brief introduction to SQL/PSM here. There are many other features in the SQL/PSM \\nstandard.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 368}, page_content='338 Chapter 10 Introduction to SQL Programming Techniques\\nbranch in lines 5 to 8 then returns one of the values {‘HUGE’, ‘LARGE’, ‘MEDIUM’, \\n‘SMALL’} based on the number of employees.\\nSQL/PSM has several constructs for looping. There are standard while  and repeat  \\nlooping structures, which have the following forms:\\nWHILE  <condition> DO\\n          <statement list>\\nEND WHILE  ;\\nREPEAT\\n          <statement list>\\nUNTIL  <condition>\\nEND REPEAT  ;\\nThere is also a cursor-based looping structure. The statement list in such a loop is \\nexecuted once for each tuple in the query result. This has the following form:\\nFOR  <loop name> AS <cursor name> CURSOR FOR  <query> DO\\n          <statement list>\\nEND FOR  ;\\nLoops can have names, and there is a LEAVE  <loop name> statement to break a loop \\nwhen a condition is satisfied. SQL/PSM has many other features, but they are out-side the scope of our presentation.\\n10.5 Comparing the Three Approaches\\nIn this section, we briefly compare the three approaches for database programming and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.\\n  4. Embedded SQL Approach.  The main advantage of this approach is that the \\nquery text is part of the program source code itself, and hence can be checked for syntax errors and validated against the database schema at compile time. This also makes the program quite readable, as the queries are readily visible //Function PSM1:\\n0) CREATE FUNCTION Dept_size(IN deptno INTEGER)1) RETURNS VARCHAR [7]2) DECLARE No_of_emps INTEGER ;3) SELECT COUNT(*) INTO No_of_emps4) FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE Dno = deptno ;5) IF No_of_emps > 100 THEN RETURN \"HUGE\"6) ELSEIF No_of_emps > 25 THEN RETURN \"LARGE\"7) ELSEIF No_of_emps > 10 THEN RETURN \"MEDIUM\"\\n8) ELSE RETURN \"SMALL\"\\n9) END IF ;Figure 10.14 \\nDeclaring a function in SQL/PSM.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 369}, page_content='10.6 Summary  339\\nin the source code. The main disadvantages are the loss of flexibility in \\nchanging the query at runtime, and the fact that all changes to queries must go through the whole recompilation process. In addition, because the que-ries are known beforehand, the choice of program variables to hold the query results is a simple task, and so the programming of the application is generally easier. However, for complex applications where queries have to be generated at runtime, the function call approach will be more suitable.\\n  5. Library of Classes and Function Calls Approach.  This approach provides \\nmore flexibility in that queries can be generated at runtime if needed. How-ever, this leads to more complex programming, as program variables that match the columns in the query result may not be known in advance. Because queries are passed as statement strings within the function calls, no checking can be done at compile time. All syntax checking and query valida-tion has to be done at runtime by preparing the query, and the programmer must check and account for possible additional runtime errors within the program code.\\n  6. Database Programming Language Approach.  This approach does not suf-\\nfer from the impedance mismatch problem, as the programming language \\ndata types are the same as the database data types. However, programmers \\nmust learn a new programming language rather than use a language they are \\nalready familiar with. In addition, some database programming languages \\nare vendor-specific, whereas general-purpose programming languages can \\neasily work with systems from multiple vendors.\\n10.6 Summary\\nIn this chapter we presented additional features of the SQL database language. In \\nparticular, we presented an overview of the most important techniques for database \\nprogramming in Section 10.1. Then we discussed the various approaches to data-\\nbase application programming in Sections 10.2 to 10.4.\\nIn Section 10.2, we discussed the general technique known as embedded SQL, \\nwhere the queries are part of the program source code. A precompiler is typically \\nused to extract SQL commands from the program for processing by the DBMS, and replacing them with function calls to the DBMS compiled code. We presented an overview of embedded SQL, using the C programming language as host language in \\nour examples. We also discussed the SQLJ technique for embedding SQL in Java programs. The concepts of cursor (for embedded SQL) and iterator (for SQLJ) were presented and illustrated by examples to show how they are used for looping over the tuples in a query result, and extracting the attribute value into program vari-ables for further processing.\\nIn Section 10.3, we discussed how function call libraries can be used to access SQL \\ndatabases. This technique is more dynamic than embedding SQL, but requires more complex programming because the attribute types and number in a query result may be determined at runtime. An overview of the SQL/CLI standard was'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 370}, page_content='340 Chapter 10 Introduction to SQL Programming Techniques\\npresented, with examples using C as the host language. We discussed some of the \\nfunctions in the SQL/CLI library, how queries are passed as strings, how query parameters are assigned at runtime, and how results are returned to program vari-ables. We then gave an overview of the JDBC class library, which is used with Java, and discussed some of its classes and operations. In particular, the \\nResultSet  class \\nis used to create objects that hold the query results, which can then be iterated over by the \\nnext()  operation. The get and set functions for retrieving attribute values \\nand setting parameter values were also discussed.\\nIn Section 10.4, we gave a brief overview of stored procedures, and discussed  \\nSQL/PSM as an example of a database programming language. Finally, we briefly compared the three approaches in Section 10.5. It is important to note that we chose to give a comparative overview of the three main approaches to database program-ming, since studying a particular approach in depth is a topic that is worthy of its own textbook.\\nReview Questions\\n 10.1.

We now turn our attention to how databases are accessed from scripting languages. Many Internet applications that provide Web interfaces to access infor-mation stored in one or more databases use scripting languages. These languages are often used to generate HTML documents, which are then displayed by the Web browser for interaction with the user. In our presentation, we assume that the reader is familiar with basic HTML concepts.\\nBasic HTML is useful for generating static  Web pages with fixed text and other \\nobjects, but most Internet applications require Web pages that provide interactive features with the user. For example, consider the case of an airline customer who wants to check the arrival time and gate information of a particular flight. The user may enter information such as a date and flight number in certain fields of the Web page. The Web interface will send this information to the application program, which formulates and submits a query to the airline database server to retrieve the information that the user needs. The database information is sent back to the Web page for display. Such Web pages, where part of the information is extracted from databases or other data sources, are called dynamic  Web pages. The data extracted \\nand displayed each time will be for different flights and dates.\\nThere are various techniques for programming dynamic features into Web pages. \\nWe will focus on one technique here, which is based on using the PHP open source server side scripting language. PHP originally stood for Personal Home Page, but now stands for PHP Hypertext Processor. PHP has experienced widespread use. The interpreters for PHP are provided free of charge and are written in the C language so chapter 11'),\n",

A PHP interpreter provides a Hyper-\\ntext Preprocessor, which will execute PHP commands in a text file and create the desired HTML file. To access databases, a library of PHP functions needs to be included in the PHP interpreter, as we will discuss in Section 11.3. PHP programs are executed on the Web server computer. This is in contrast to some scripting lan-guages, such as JavaScript, that are executed on the client computer. There are many other popular scripting languages that can be used to access databases and create dynamic Web pages, such as JavaScript, Ruby, Python, and PERL, to name a few.\\nThis chapter is organized as follows. Section 11.1 gives a simple example to illustrate \\nhow PHP can be used. Section 11.2 gives a general overview of the PHP language and how it is used to program some basic functions for interactive Web pages. Sec-tion 11.3 focuses on using PHP to interact with SQL databases through a library of functions known as PEAR DB. Section 11.4 lists some of the additional technologies associated with Java for Web and database programming (we already discussed JDBC and SQLJ in Chapter 10). Finally, Section 11.5 contains a chapter summary.\\n11.1 A Simple PHP Example\\nPHP is an open source general-purpose scripting language. The interpreter engine for PHP is written in the C programming language so it can be used on nearly all types of computers and operating systems. PHP usually comes installed with the UNIX operating system. For computer platforms with other operating systems such as Windows, Linux, or Mac OS, the PHP interpreter can be downloaded from: http://www.php.net. As with other scripting languages, PHP is particularly suited for manipulation of text pages, and in particular for manipulating dynamic HTML pages at the Web server computer. This is in contrast to JavaScript, which is down-loaded with the Web pages to execute on the client computer.\\nPHP has libraries of functions for accessing databases stored under various types of \\nrelational database systems such as Oracle, MySQL, SQLServer, and any system that supports the ODBC standard (see Chapter 10). Under the three-tier architec-ture (see Chapter 2), the DBMS would reside at the bottom-tier database server . \\nPHP would run at the middle-tier Web server , where the PHP program commands \\nwould manipulate the HTML files to create the customized dynamic Web pages. The HTML is then sent to the client tier  for display and interaction with the user.\\nConsider the PHP example shown in Figure 11.1(a), which prompts a user to enter \\nthe first and last name and then prints a welcome message to that user. The line numbers are not part of the program code; they are used below for explanation purposes only:\\n  1. Suppose that the file containing PHP script in program segment P1 is stored in the following Internet location: http://www.myserver.com/example/greeting.php. \\nThen if a user types this address in the browser, the PHP interpreter would start \\ninterpreting the code and produce the form shown in Figure 11.1(b). We will \\nexplain how that happens as we go over the lines in code segment P1.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 375}, page_content='11.1 A Simple PHP Example  345\\n  2. Line 0 shows the PHP start tag <?php , which indicates to the PHP inter-\\npreter engine that it should process all subsequent text lines until it encoun-ters the PHP end tag \\n?>, shown on line 16. Text outside of these tags is \\nprinted as is. This allows PHP code segments to be included within a larger HTML file. Only the sections in the file between \\n<?php  and ?> are processed \\nby the PHP preprocessor.\\n  3. Line 1 shows one way of posting comments in a PHP program on a single line started by \\n//. Single-line comments can also be started with #, and end \\nat the end of the line in which they are entered. Multiple-line comments start with \\n/* and end with */.\\n  4. The auto-global  predefined PHP variable $_POST  (line 2) is an array that \\nholds all the values entered through form parameters. Arrays in PHP are Enter your name:\\nSUBMIT NAME SUBMIT NAMEEnter your name:(b) (c)\\n(d)John Smith\\nWelcome, John Smith(a)\\n    //Program Segment P1: 0) <?php 1) // Printing a welcome message if the user submitted their name    // through the HTML form 2) if ($_POST[\\'user_name\\']) { 3)   print(\"Welcome, \") ; 4)   print($_POST[\\'user_name\\']); 5) } 6) else { 7)   // Printing the form to enter the user name since no name has      // been entered yet 8)   print <<<_HTML_ 9)   <FORM method=\"post\" action=\"$_SERVER[\\'PHP_SELF\\']\">10)   Enter your name: <input type=\"text\" name=\"user_name\">11)   <BR/>12)   <INPUT type=\"submit\" value=\"SUBMIT NAME\">13)   </FORM>14)   _HTML_;15) }16) ?>\\nFigure 11.1 \\n(a) PHP program segment for entering a greeting.

They can be numerically \\nindexed arrays whose indexes (positions) are numbered (0, 1, 2, … ), or they can be associative arrays whose indexes can be any string values. For exam-ple, an associative array indexed based on color can have the indexes {“red”, “blue”, “green”}. In this example, \\n$_POST  is associatively indexed by the \\nname of the posted value user_name  that is specified in the name attribute of \\nthe input tag on line 10. Thus $_POST[\\'user_name\\']  will contain the value \\ntyped in by the user. We will discuss PHP arrays further in Section 11.2.2.\\n  5. When the Web page at http://www.myserver.com/example/greeting.php is first opened, the \\nif condition in line 2 will evaluate to false because there is \\nno value yet in $_POST[\\'user_name\\'] . Hence, the PHP interpreter will \\nprocess lines 6 through 15, which create the text for an HTML file that dis-plays the form shown in Figure 11.1(b). This is then displayed at the client side by the Web browser.\\n  6. Line 8 shows one way of creating long text strings  in an HTML file. We will \\ndiscuss other ways to specify strings later in this section. All text between an \\nopening <<<_HTML_  and a closing _HTML_;  is printed into the HTML file as \\nis. The closing _HTML_;  must be alone on a separate line. Thus, the text \\nadded to the HTML file sent to the client will be the text between lines 9  \\nand 13. This includes HTML tags to create the form shown in Figure 11.1(b).\\n  7. PHP variable names  start with a $ sign and can include characters, num-\\nbers, and the underscore character _. The PHP auto-global (predefined) \\nvariable $_SERVER  (line 9) is an array that includes information about the \\nlocal server. The element $_SERVER[\\'PHP_SELF\\']  in the array is the path \\nname of the PHP file currently being executed on the server. Thus, the action attribute of the form tag (line 9) instructs the PHP interpreter to reprocess the same file, once the form parameters are entered by the user.\\n  8. Once the user types the name John Smith  in the text box and clicks on the \\nSUBMIT NAME  button (Figure 11.1(c)), program segment P1 is repro-\\ncessed. This time, $_POST[\\'user_name\\']  will include the string  \\n\"John Smith\" , so lines 3 and 4 will now be placed in the HTML file sent to \\nthe client, which displays the message in Figure 11.1(d).\\nAs we can see from this example, a PHP program can create two different HTML \\ncommands depending on whether the user just started or whether they had already \\nsubmitted their name through the form. In general, a PHP program can create numerous variations of HTML text in an HTML file at the server depending on the particular conditional paths taken in the program. Hence, the HTML sent to the client will be different depending on the interaction with the user. This is one way in which PHP is used to create dynamic  Web pages.\\n11.2 Overview of Basic Features of PHP\\nIn this section we give an overview of a few of the features of PHP that are useful in \\ncreating interactive HTML pages. Section 11.3 will focus on how PHP programs \\ncan access databases for querying and updating. We cannot give a comprehensive'),\n",

Rather, we focus \\non illustrating certain features of PHP that are particularly suited for creating dynamic Web pages that contain database access commands. This section covers some PHP concepts and features that will be needed when we discuss database access in Section 11.3.\\n11.2.1 PHP Variables, Data Types, and Programming Constructs\\nPHP variable names  start with the $ symbol and can include characters, letters, and \\nthe underscore character ( _). No other special characters are permitted. Variable \\nnames are case sensitive, and the first character cannot be a number. Variables are not typed. The values assigned to the variables determine their type. In fact, the same variable can change its type once a new value is assigned to it. Assignment is via the \\n= operator.\\nSince PHP is directed toward text processing, there are several different types of \\nstring values. There are also many functions available for processing strings. We only discuss some basic properties of string values and variables here. Figure 11.2 illustrates some string values. There are three main ways to express strings and text:\\n  1. Single-quoted strings.  Enclose the string between single quotes, as in lines \\n0, 1, and 2. If a single quote is needed within the string, use the escape char-acter (\\n\\\\) (see line 2).\\n  2. Double-quoted strings.  Enclose strings between double quotes as in  \\nline 7. In this case, variable names appearing within the string  are replaced \\nby the values that are currently stored in these variables. The interpreter identifies variable names within double-quoted strings by their initial character \\n$ and replaces them with the value in the variable. This is known \\nas interpolating variables  within strings. Interpolation does not occur in \\nsingle-quoted strings.\\n  3. Here documents.  Enclose a part of a document between a <<<DOCNAME   \\nand end it with a single line containing the document name DOCNAME .  \\n 0) print \\'Welcome to my Web site.\\';\\n 1) print \\'I said to him, \"Welcome Home\"\\';\\n 2) print \\'We\\\\\\'ll now visit the next Web site\\'; 3) printf(\\'The cost is $%.2f and the tax is $%.2f\\',  \\n$cost, $tax) ;\\n 4) print strtolower(\\'AbCdE\\');\\n 5) print ucwords(strtolower(\\'JOHN smith\\')); 6) print \\'abc\\' . \\'efg\\'\\n 7) print \"send your email reply to: $email_address\"\\n 8) print <<<FORM_HTML 9) <FORM method=\"post\" action=\"$_SERVER[\\'PHP_SELF\\']\">\\n10) Enter your name: <input type=\"text\" name=\"user_name\">\\n11) FORM_HTMLFigure 11.2 \\nIllustrating basic PHP string and text values.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 378}, page_content='348 Chapter 11 Web Database Programming Using PHP\\nDOCNAME  can be any string as long as it used both to start and end the here \\ndocument. This is illustrated in lines 8 through 11 in Figure 11.2. Variables are also interpolated by replacing them with their string values if they appear inside here documents. This feature is used in a similar way to double-quoted strings, but it is more convenient for multiple-line text.\\n  4. Single and double quotes.  Single and double quotes used by PHP to enclose \\nstrings should be straight  quotes (\"\") on both sides of the string. The text \\neditor that creates these quotes should not produce curly  opening and clos-\\ning quotes (“ ”) around the string.\\nThere is also a string concatenate operator specified by the period ( .) symbol, as \\nillustrated in line 6 of Figure 11.2. There are many string functions. We only illus-trate a couple of them here. The function \\nstrtolower  changes the alphabetic char-\\nacters in the string to all lowercase, whereas the function ucwords  capitalizes all the \\nwords in a string. These are illustrated in lines 4 and 5 in Figure 11.2.\\nThe general rule is to use single-quoted strings for literal strings that contain no \\nPHP program variables and the other two types (double-quoted strings and here \\ndocuments) when the values from variables need to be interpolated into the string. \\nFor large blocks of multiline text, the program should use the here documents  style \\nfor strings.\\nPHP also has numeric data types for integers and floating points and generally fol-\\nlows the rules of the C programming language for processing these types. Numbers \\ncan be formatted for printing into strings by specifying the number of digits that \\nfollow the decimal point. A variation of the print  function called printf  (print \\nformatted) allows formatting of numbers within a string, as illustrated in line 3 of Figure 11.2.\\nThere are the standard programming language constructs of for-loops, while-loops, \\nand conditional if-statements. They are generally similar to their C language coun-\\nterparts. We will not discuss them here. Similarly, any value  evaluates to true if used \\nas a Boolean expression except for  numeric zero (\\n0) and blank string, which evalu-\\nate to false. There are also literal true and false values that can be assigned. The comparison operators also generally follow C language rules. They are \\n== (equal), \\n!= (not equal), > (greater than), >= (greater than or equal), < (less than),  \\nand <= (less than or equal).\\n11.2.2 PHP Arrays\\nArrays are very important in PHP, since they allow lists of elements. They are used frequently in forms that employ pull-down menus. A single-dimensional array is \\nused to hold the list of choices in the pull-down menu. For database query results, \\ntwo-dimensional arrays are used, with the first dimension representing rows  of a \\ntable and the second dimension representing columns  (attributes) within a row. \\nThere are two main types of arrays: numeric and associative. We discuss each of these in the context of single-dimensional arrays next.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 379}, page_content='11.2 Overview of Basic Features of PHP  349\\nA numeric array  associates a numeric index (or position or sequence number) with \\neach element in the array. Indexes are integer numbers that start at zero and grow incrementally. An element in the array is referenced through its index. An  associative array  provides pairs of (key \\n=> value) elements. The value of an element \\nis referenced through its key, and all key values in a particular array must be unique. The element values can be strings or integers, or they can be arrays themselves, thus leading to higher dimensional arrays.\\nFigure 11.3 gives two examples of array variables: \\n$teaching  and $courses . The \\nfirst array $teaching  is associative (see line 0 in Figure 11.3), and each element \\nassociates a course name (as key) with the name of the course instructor (as value). There are three elements in this array. Line 1 shows how the array may be updated. The first command in line 1 assigns a new instructor to the course ‘Graphics’ by updating its value. Since the key value ‘Graphics’ already exists in the array, no new element is created but the existing value is updated. The second command creates a new element since the key value ‘Data Mining’ did not exist in the array before. New elements are added at the end of the array.\\nIf we only provide values (no keys) as array elements, the keys are automatically \\nnumeric and numbered 0, 1, 2, … . This is illustrated in line 5 of Figure 11.3, by the \\n$courses  array. Both associative and numeric arrays have no size limits. If \\nsome value of another data type, say an integer, is assigned to a PHP variable that \\nwas holding an array, the variable now holds the integer value and the array con-\\ntents are lost. Basically, most variables can be assigned to values of any data type \\nat any time.\\nThere are several different techniques for looping through arrays in PHP. We illus-\\ntrate two of these techniques in Figure 11.3. Lines 3 and 4 show one method of looping through all the elements in an array using the \\nforeach  construct, and \\nprinting the key and value of each element on a separate line. Lines 7 through 10 \\nshow how a traditional for-loop construct can be used. A built-in function count \\nFigure 11.3 \\nIllustrating basic PHP array processing.\\n 0) $teaching = array(\\'Database\\' => \\'Smith\\', \\'OS\\' => \\'Carrick\\',\\n                      \\'Graphics\\' => \\'Kam\\'); 1) $teaching[\\'Graphics\\'] = \\'Benson\\'; $teaching[\\'Data Mining\\'] = \\'Li\\'; 2) sort($teaching); 3) foreach ($teaching as $key => $value) { 4)   print \" $key : $value\\\\n\";} 5) $courses = array(\\'Database\\', \\'OS\\', \\'Graphics\\', \\'Data Mining\\'); 6) $alt_row_color = array(\\'blue\\', \\'yellow\\'); 7) for ($i = 0, $num = count($courses); i < $num; $i++) { 8)   print \\'<TR bgcolor=\"\\' . $alt_row_color[$i % 2] . \\'\">\\'; 9)   print \"<TD>Course $i is</TD><TD>$course[$i]</TD></TR>\\\\n\";10) }'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 380}, page_content='350 Chapter 11 Web Database Programming Using PHP\\n(line 7) returns the current number of elements in the array, which is assigned to \\nthe variable $num  and used to control ending the loop.\\nThe example in lines 7 through 10 also illustrates how an HTML table can be  \\ndisplayed with alternating row colors, by setting the two colors in an array  \\n$alt_row_color  (line 8). Each time through the loop, the remainder function  \\n$i % 2  switches from one row (index 0) to the next (index 1) (see line 8). The color \\nis assigned to the HTML bgcolor  attribute of the <TR>  (table row) tag.\\nThe count function (line 7) returns the current number of elements in the array. \\nThe sort function (line 2) sorts the array based on the element values in it (not the keys). For associative arrays, each key remains associated with the same element value after sorting. This does not occur when sorting numeric arrays. There are many other functions that can be applied to PHP arrays, but a full discussion is outside the scope of our presentation.\\n11.2.3 PHP Functions\\nAs with other programming languages, functions  can be defined in PHP to bet-\\nter structure a complex program and to share common sections of code that can \\nbe reused by multiple applications. The newer version of PHP, PHP5, also has \\nobject-oriented features, but we will not discuss these here because we are focus-ing on the basics of PHP. Basic PHP functions can have arguments that are passed by value . Global variables can be accessed within functions. Standard \\nscope rules apply to variables that appear within a function and within the code that calls the function.\\nWe now give two simple examples to illustrate basic PHP functions. In Figure 11.4, \\nwe show how we could rewrite the code segment P1 from Figure 11.1(a) using func-tions. The code segment P1 ′ in Figure 11.4 has two functions: \\ndisplay_welcome()  \\n(lines 0 to 3) and display_empty_form()  (lines 5 to 13). Neither of these func-\\ntions has arguments; nor do they have return values. Lines 14 through 19 show how we can call these functions to produce the same effect as the segment of code P1 in Figure 11.1(a). As we can see in this example, functions can be used just to make the PHP code better structured and easier to follow.\\nA second example is shown in Figure 11.5. Here we are using the \\n$teaching  array \\nintroduced in Figure 11.3. The function course_instructor()  in lines 0 to 8 in \\nFigure 11.5 has two arguments: $course  (a string holding a course name) and \\n$teaching_assignments  (an associative array holding course assignments, simi-\\nlar to the $teaching  array shown in Figure 11.3). The function finds the name of \\nthe instructor who teaches a particular course. Lines 9 to 14 in Figure 11.5 show how this function may be used.\\nThe function call in line 11 would return the string: Smith is teaching Database , \\nbecause the array entry with the key ‘Database’ has the value ‘Smith’ for instructor. On the other hand, the function call on line 13 would return the string: there is no \\nComputer Architecture course  because there is no entry in the array with the key'),\n",

A few comments about this example and about PHP \\nfunctions in general:\\n ■The built-in PHP array function array_key_exists($k, $a)  returns true \\nif the value in variable $k exists as a key  in the associative array  in the vari-\\nable $a. In our example, it checks whether the $course  value provided \\nexists as a key in the array $teaching_assignments  (line 1 in Figure 11.5).\\n ■Function arguments are passed by value. Hence, in this example, the calls in \\nlines 11 and 13 could not change the array $teaching  provided as argu-\\nment for the call. The values provided in the arguments are passed (copied) to the function arguments when the function is called.\\n ■Return values of a function are placed after the RETURN  keyword. A function \\ncan return any type. In this example, it returns a string type. Two different strings can be returned in our example, depending on whether the \\n$course  \\nkey value provided exists in the array or not.\\n ■Scope rules for variable names apply as in other programming languages. \\nGlobal variables outside of the function cannot be used unless they are referred \\nto using the built-in PHP array $GLOBALS . Basically, $GLOBALS['abc']  will \\naccess the value in a global variable $abc  defined outside the function. Other-\\nwise, variables appearing inside a function are local even if there is a global \\nvariable with the same name.\\nThe previous discussion gives a brief overview of PHP functions. Many details are \\nnot discussed since it is not our goal to present PHP in detail.\\n11.2.4 PHP Server Variables and Forms\\nThere are a number of built-in entries in a PHP auto-global built-in array variable called \\n$_SERVER  that can provide the programmer with useful information about \\nthe server where the PHP interpreter is running, as well as other information. These may be needed when constructing the text in an HTML document (for example, see line 7 in Figure 11.4). Here are some of these entries:\\n  1. $_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] . This provides the Web site name or the Uni-\\nform Resource Locator (URL) of the server computer where the PHP inter-preter is running. For example, if the PHP interpreter is running on the  Web site http://www.uta.edu, then this string would be the value in  \\n$_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] .\\n  2. $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDRESS'] . This is the IP (Internet Protocol) address \\nof the client user computer that is accessing the server; for example, 129.107.61.8.\\n  3. $_SERVER['REMOTE_HOST'] .

In this case, the server will need to translate the name into an IP address to access the client.\\n  4. $_SERVER['PATH_INFO'] .

This provides the string that holds parame-\\nters in a URL after a question mark (?) at the end of the URL. This can hold search parameters, for example.\\n  6. $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . This is the root directory that holds the \\nfiles on the Web server that are accessible to client users.\\nThese and other entries in the $_SERVER  array are usually needed when creating \\nthe HTML file to be sent to the client for display.\\nAnother important PHP auto-global built-in array variable is called $_POST . This \\nprovides the programmer with input values submitted by the user through HTML forms specified in the HTML \\n<INPUT>  tag and other similar tags.

The keys to this array are the names of the various input parameters provided via the form, for example by using the \\nname  attribute of the \\nHTML <INPUT>  tag as on line 8. When users enter data through forms, the data \\nvalues are stored in this array.\\n11.3 Overview of PHP Database Programming\\nThere are various techniques for accessing a database through a programming lan-guage. We discussed some of the techniques in Chapter 10, in the overviews of how to access an SQL database using the C and Java programming languages. In particu-lar, we discussed embedded SQL, JDBC, SQL/CLI (similar to ODBC), and SQLJ. In this section we give an overview of how to access the database using the script lan-guage PHP, which is suitable for creating Web interfaces for searching and updat-ing databases, as well as dynamic Web pages.\\nThere is a PHP database access function library that is part of PHP Extension and \\nApplication Repository (PEAR), which is a collection of several libraries of func-tions for enhancing PHP. The PEAR DB library provides functions for database access. Many database systems can be accessed from this library, including Oracle, MySQL, SQLite, and Microsoft SQLServer, among others.\\nWe will discuss several functions that are part of PEAR DB in the context of some \\nexamples. Section 11.3.1 shows how to connect to a database using PHP. Sec- tion 11.3.2 discusses how data collected from HTML forms can be used to insert a new record in a database table. Section 11.3.3 shows how retrieval queries can be executed and have their results displayed within a dynamic Web page.\\n11.3.1 Connecting to a Database\\nTo use the database functions in a PHP program, the PEAR DB library module called \\nDB.php  must be loaded. In Figure 11.6, this is done in line 0 of the example. \\nThe DB library functions can now be accessed using DB::<function_name> . \\nThe function for connecting to a database is called DB::connect('string'),\"),\n",

The connection \\ninformation is kept in the database connection variable $d, which is used whenever \\nan operation to this particular database is applied.\\nChecking for errors. Line 2 in Figure 11.6 shows how to check whether the \\nconnection to the database was established successfully or not. PEAR DB has a \\nfunction DB::isError , which can determine whether any database access oper-\\nation was successful or not. The argument to this function is the database con-nection variable (\\n$d in this example). In general, the PHP programmer can \\ncheck after every database call to determine whether the last database operation \\nwas successful or not, and terminate the program (using the die function) if it \\nwas not successful. An error message is also returned from the database via the operation \\n$d->get_message() . This can also be displayed as shown in line 2 of \\nFigure 11.6.\\nSubmitting queries and other SQL statements. In general, most SQL com-\\nmands can be sent to the database once a connection is established by using the \\nquery  function. The function $d->query  takes an SQL command as its string argu-\\nment and sends it to the database server for execution. In Figure 11.6, lines 3 to 7 send a \\nCREATE TABLE  command to create a table called EMPLOYEE  with four attri-\\nbutes. Whenever a query or SQL statement is executed, the result of the query is assigned to a query variable, which is called \\n$q in our example. Line 8 checks \\nwhether the query was executed successfully or not.\\nThe PHP PEAR DB library offers an alternative to having to check for errors after \\nevery database command. The function\\n$d–>setErrorHandling(PEAR_ERROR_DIE)\\nwill terminate the program and print the default error messages if any subsequent \\nerrors occur when accessing the database through connection $d (see line 9 in \\nFigure 11.6).\\n11.3.2  Collecting Data from Forms  \\nand Inserting Records\\nIt is common in database applications to collect information through HTML or \\nother types of Web forms. For example, when purchasing an airline ticket or apply-\\ning for a credit card, the user has to enter personal information such as name, \\naddress, and phone number. This information is typically collected and stored in a \\ndatabase record on a database server.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 386}, page_content=\"356 Chapter 11 Web Database Programming Using PHP\\nLines 10 through 12 in Figure 11.6 illustrate how this may be done. In this exam-\\nple, we omitted the code for creating the form and collecting the data, which can be a variation of the example in Figure 11.1. We assume that the user entered valid values in the input parameters called \\nemp_name , emp_job , and emp_dno . These \\nwould be accessible via the PHP auto-global array $_POST  as discussed at the end \\nof Section 11.2.4.\\nIn the SQL INSERT  command shown on lines 11 and 12 in Figure 11.6, the array \\nentries $POST['emp_name'] , $POST['emp_job'] , and $POST['emp_dno']  will \\nhold the values collected from the user through the input form of HTML. These are then inserted as a new employee record in the \\nEMPLOYEE  table.\\nThis example also illustrates another feature of PEAR DB. It is common in some \\napplications to create a unique record identifier for each new record inserted into the database.\\n1\\nPHP has a function $d–>nextID  to create a sequence of unique values for a partic-\\nular table. In our example, the field Emp_id  of the EMPLOYEE  table (see Figure 11.6, \\nline 4) is created for this purpose. Line 10 shows how to retrieve the next unique \\nvalue in the sequence for the EMPLOYEE  table and insert it as part of the new record \\nin lines 11 and 12.\\nThe code for insert in lines 10 to 12 in Figure 11.6 may allow malicious strings to be \\nentered that can alter the INSERT  command. A safer way to do inserts and other \\nqueries is through the use of placeholders  (specified by the ? symbol). An example \\nis illustrated in lines 13 to 15, where another record is to be inserted. In this form of the \\n$d->query()  function, there are two arguments. The first argument is the SQL \\nstatement, with one or more ? symbols (placeholders). The second argument is an \\narray, whose element values will be used to replace the placeholders in the order \\nthey are specified (see lines 13 to 15 in Figure 11.6).\\n11.3.3 Retrieval Queries from Database Tables\\nWe now give three examples of retrieval queries through PHP, shown in Fig- ure 11.7. The first few lines 0 to 3 establish a database connection \\n$d and set the \\nerror handling to the default, as we discussed in the previous section. The first query (lines 4 to 7) retrieves the name and department number of all employee records. The query variable \\n$q is used to refer to the query result . A while-loop to \\ngo over each row in the result is shown in lines 5 to 7. The function $q->fetchRow()  \\nin line 5 serves to retrieve the next record in the query result and to control the loop. The looping starts at the first record.\\nThe second query example is shown in lines 8 to 13 and illustrates a dynamic \\nquery. In this query, the conditions for selection of rows are based on values input by the user. Here we want to retrieve the names of employees who have a \\n1This would be similar to the system-generated OID discussed in Chapter 12 for object and object-rela-\\ntional database systems.\"),\n",

The particular job and \\ndepartment number are entered through a form in the array variables \\n$POST[\\'emp_job\\']  and $POST[\\'emp_dno\\'] . If the user had entered  \\n‘Engineer’ for the job and 5 for the department number, the query would select the names of all engineers who worked in department 5. As we can see, this is a dynamic query whose results differ depending on the choices that the user enters as input. We used two \\n? placeholders in this example, as discussed at the \\nend of Section 11.3.2.\\nThe last query (lines 14 to 17) shows an alternative way of specifying a query and \\nlooping over its rows. In this example, the function $d=>getAll  holds all the \\nrecords in a query result in a single variable, called $allresult . To loop over the \\nindividual records, a foreach  loop can be used, with the row variable $r iterating \\nover each row in $allresult .2\\nAs we can see, PHP is suited for both database access and creating dynamic Web pages. 0) require \\'DB.php\\';\\n 1) $d = DB::connect(\\'oci8://acct1:pass12@www.host.com/dbname\\'); 2) if (DB::isError($d)) { die(\"cannot connect − \" . $d->getMessage()); } 3) $d->setErrorHandling(PEAR_ERROR_DIE);    ... 4) $q = $d->query(\\'SELECT Name, Dno FROM EMPLOYEE\\'); 5) while ($r = $q->fetchRow()) { 6)   print \"employee $r[0] works for department $r[1] \\\\n\" ; 7) }    ... 8) $q = $d->query(\\'SELECT Name FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE Job = ?

The Java environment has components that run on the server and other components that can run on the client machine. It also has standards for exchanging data objects. We briefly discuss some of these components here that are related to Web and database access. We already discussed JDBC and SQLJ in some detail in Chapter 10.\\nJava Servlets.  Servlets are Java objects that can reside on the Web server \\nmachine and manage interactions with the client. They can store information that was submitted by the client during a session, so that this information can be used to generate database queries. Servlet objects can also store query results so that parts of these results can be formatted as HTML and sent to the client for display. The servlet object can maintain all the information produced dur-ing a particular client interaction until the client session is terminated.\\nJava Server Pages (JSP).  This allows scripting at the server to produce dynamic Web \\npages to be sent at the client in a manner somewhat similar to PHP. However, it is associated with the Java language and the scripting can be combined with Java code.\\nJavaScript.  JavaScript is a scripting language that is different from the Java \\nprogramming language and was developed separately. It is widely used in Web applications, and it can run on the client computer or on the server.\\nJava Script Object Notation (JSON).  This is a text-based representation of \\ndata objects, so that data can be formatted in JSON and exchanged between clients and servers over the Web in text format. It can be considered as an alter-native to XML (see Chapter 13) and represents objects using attribute-value pairs. JSON has also been adopted as the data model by some newer database systems known as NOSQL systems, such as MongoDB (see Chapter 24).\\n11.5 Summary\\nIn this chapter, we gave an overview of how to convert some structured data from databases into elements to be entered or displayed on a Web page. We focused on the PHP scripting language, which is becoming very popular for Web database pro-gramming. Section 11.1 presented some PHP basics for Web programming through a simple example. Section 11.2 gave some of the basics of the PHP language, includ-ing its array and string data types that are used extensively. Section 11.3 presented an overview of how PHP can be used to specify various types of database com-mands, including creating tables, inserting new records, and retrieving database records. PHP runs at the server computer in comparison to some other scripting languages that run on the client computer. Section 11.4 introduced some of the technologies associated with Java that can be used in similar contexts.'),\n",

Some features of object data models have also been incorporated into the data mod-els of newer types of database systems, known as NOSQL systems (see Chapter 24). In addition, the XML model (see Chapter 13) has similarities to the object model. So an introduction to the object model will give a good perspective on many of the recent advances in database technology. Database systems that were based on the object data model were known originally as object-oriented databases (OODBs) but are now referred to as object databases  (ODBs ).Traditional data models and sys-\\ntems, such as network, hierarchical, and relational have been quite successful in \\ndeveloping the database technologies required for many traditional business data-base applications. However, they have certain shortcomings when more complex database applications must be designed and implemented—for example, databases for engineering design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM and CIM\\n1), biological and \\nother sciences, telecommunications, geographic information systems, and multi-media.\\n2 These ODBs were developed for applications that have requirements \\nrequiring more complex structures for stored objects. A key feature of object data-bases is the power they give the designer to specify both the structure  of complex \\nobjects and the operations  that can be applied to these objects.chapter 12\\n1Computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing and computer-integrated manufacturing.\\n2Multimedia databases must store various types of multimedia objects, such as video, audio, images, \\ngraphics, and documents (see Chapter 26).'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 394}, page_content='364 Chapter 12 Object and Object-Relational Databases\\nAnother reason for the creation of object-oriented databases is the vast increase in \\nthe use of object-oriented programming languages for developing software applica-tions. Databases are fundamental components in many software systems, and tradi-tional databases are sometimes difficult to use with software applications that are developed in an object-oriented programming language such as C++ or Java. Object databases are designed so they can be directly—or seamlessly —integrated with soft-\\nware that is developed using object-oriented programming languages.\\nRelational DBMS (RDBMS) vendors have also recognized the need for incorporat-\\ning features that were proposed for object databases, and newer versions of rela-tional systems have incorporated many of these features. This has led to database systems that are characterized as object-relational  or ORDBMSs. A recent version \\nof the SQL standard (2008) for RDBMSs, known as SQL/Foundation, includes many of these features, which were originally known as SQL/Object and have now been merged into the main SQL specification.\\nAlthough many experimental prototypes and commercial object-oriented database \\nsystems have been created, they have not found widespread use because of the pop-ularity of relational and object-relational systems. The experimental prototypes included the Orion system developed at MCC, OpenOODB at Texas Instruments, the Iris system at Hewlett-Packard laboratories, the Ode system at AT&T Bell Labs, and the ENCORE/ObServer project at Brown University. Commercially available systems included GemStone Object Server of GemStone Systems, ONTOS DB  of Ontos, Objectivity/DB of Objectivity Inc., Versant Object Database and  FastObjects by Versant Corporation (and Poet), ObjectStore of Object Design, and Ardent Database of Ardent.\\nAs commercial object DBMSs became available, the need for a standard model and \\nlanguage was recognized. Because the formal procedure for approval of standards normally takes a number of years, a consortium of object DBMS vendors and users, called ODMG, proposed a standard whose current specification is known as the ODMG 3.0 standard.\\nObject-oriented databases have adopted many of the concepts that were developed \\noriginally for object-oriented programming languages.\\n3 In Section 12.1, we describe \\nthe key concepts utilized in many object database systems and that were later incor-porated into object-relational systems and the SQL standard. These include object \\nidentity , object structure  and type constructors , encapsulation of operations , and the \\ndefinition of methods  as part of class declarations, mechanisms for storing objects \\nin a database by making them persistent,  and type and class hierarchies  and inheri-\\ntance.  Then, in Section 12.2 we see how these concepts have been incorporated into \\nthe latest SQL standards, leading to object-relational databases. Object features were originally introduced in SQL:1999, and then updated in SQL:2008. In Sec- tion 12.3, we turn our attention to “pure” object database standards by presenting features of the object database standard ODMG 3.0 and the object definition  \\n3Similar concepts were also developed in the fields of semantic data modeling and knowledge  \\nrepresentation.'),\n",

Section 12.4 presents an overview of the database design process for \\nobject databases. Section 12.5 discusses the object query language (OQL), which is part of the ODMG 3.0 standard. In Section 12.6, we discuss programming language bindings, which specify how to extend object-oriented programming languages to include the features of the object database standard. Section 12.7 summarizes the chapter. Sections 12.3 through 12.6 may be left out if a less thorough introduction to object databases is desired.\\n12.1 Overview of Object Database Concepts\\n12.1.1 Introduction to Object-Oriented Concepts and Features\\nThe term object-oriented —abbreviated OO or O-O —has its origins in OO pro-\\ngramming languages, or OOPLs. Today OO concepts are applied in the areas of databases, software engineering, knowledge bases, artificial intelligence, and computer systems in general. OOPLs have their roots in the SIMULA language, which was proposed in the late 1960s. The programming language Smalltalk, developed at Xerox PARC\\n4 in the 1970s, was one of the first languages to explic-\\nitly incorporate additional OO concepts, such as message passing and inheri-tance. It is known as a pure  OO programming language, meaning that it was \\nexplicitly designed to be object-oriented. This contrasts with hybrid  OO pro-\\ngramming languages, which incorporate OO concepts into an already existing language. An example of the latter is C++, which incorporates OO concepts into the popular C programming language.\\nAn object  typically has two components: state (value) and behavior (operations). It \\ncan have a complex data structure  as well as specific operations  defined by the pro-\\ngrammer.\\n5 Objects in an OOPL exist only during program execution; therefore, \\nthey are called transient objects.  An OO database can extend the existence of objects \\nso that they are stored permanently in a database, and hence the objects become persistent objects  that exist beyond program termination and can be retrieved later \\nand shared by other programs. In other words, OO databases store persistent objects permanently in secondary storage and allow the sharing of these objects among multiple programs and applications. This requires the incorporation of other well-known features of database management systems, such as indexing mechanisms to efficiently locate the objects, concurrency control to allow object sharing among concurrent programs, and recovery from failures. An OO database system will typically interface with one or more OO programming languages to provide persistent and shared object capabilities.\\nThe internal structure of an object in OOPLs includes the specification of instance \\nvariables , which hold the values that define the internal state of the object. An \\ninstance variable is similar to the concept of an attribute  in the relational model , \\n4Palo Alto Research Center, Palo Alto, California.\\n5Objects have many other characteristics, as we discuss in the rest of this chapter.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 396}, page_content='366 Chapter 12 Object and Object-Relational Databases\\nexcept that instance variables may be encapsulated within the object and thus are \\nnot necessarily visible to external users. Instance variables may also be of arbitrarily complex data types. Object-oriented systems allow definition of the operations or functions (behavior) that can be applied to objects of a particular type. In fact, some OO models insist that all operations a user can apply to an object must be pre-defined. This forces a complete encapsulation  of objects. This rigid approach has \\nbeen relaxed in most OO data models for two reasons. First, database users often need to know the attribute names so they can specify selection conditions on the attributes to retrieve specific objects. Second, complete encapsulation implies that any simple retrieval requires a predefined operation, thus making ad hoc queries difficult to specify on the fly.\\nTo encourage encapsulation, an operation is defined in two parts. The first part, \\ncalled the signature  or interface  of the operation, specifies the operation name and \\narguments (or parameters). The second part, called the method  or body,  specifies \\nthe implementation  of the operation, usually written in some general-purpose pro-\\ngramming language. Operations can be invoked by passing a message  to an object, \\nwhich includes the operation name and the parameters. The object then executes the method for that operation. This encapsulation permits modification of the internal structure of an object, as well as the implementation of its operations, with-out the need to disturb the external programs that invoke these operations. Hence, encapsulation provides a form of data and operation independence (see Chapter 2).\\nAnother key concept in OO systems is that of type and class hierarchies and inheri-\\ntance.  This permits specification of new types or classes that inherit much of their \\nstructure and/or operations from previously defined types or classes. This makes it easier to develop the data types of a system incrementally and to reuse  existing type \\ndefinitions when creating new types of objects.\\nOne problem in early OO database systems involved representing relationships  \\namong objects. The insistence on complete encapsulation in early OO data models led to the argument that relationships should not be explicitly represented, but should instead be described by defining appropriate methods that locate related objects. However, this approach does not work very well for complex databases with many relationships because it is useful to identify these relationships and make them visible to users. The ODMG object database standard has recognized this need and it explicitly represents binary relationships via a pair of inverse references , \\nas we will describe in Section 12.3.\\nAnother OO concept is operator overloading,  which refers to an operation’s ability \\nto be applied to different types of objects; in such a situation, an operation name  \\nmay refer to several distinct implementations,  depending on the type of object it is \\napplied to. This feature is also called operator polymorphism.  For example, an oper-\\nation to calculate the area of a geometric object may differ in its method (imple-mentation), depending on whether the object is of type triangle, circle, or rectangle. This may require the use of late binding  of the operation name to the appropriate \\nmethod at runtime, when the type of object to which the operation is applied \\nbecomes known.'),\n",

In Section 12.2, we show how some of these concepts have been incorporated into the SQL:2008 standard for relational databases. Then in Sec-tion 12.3, we show how these concepts are realized in the ODMG 3.0 object data-base standard.\\n12.1.2 Object Identity, and Objects versus Literals\\nOne goal of an ODB is to maintain a direct correspondence between real-world and database objects so that objects do not lose their integrity and identity and can easily be identified and operated upon. Hence, a unique identity  is assigned \\nto each independent object stored in the database. This unique identity is typi-cally implemented via a unique, system-generated object identifier (OID) . The \\nvalue of an OID may not be visible to the external user but is used internally by the system to identify each object uniquely and to create and manage interobject references. The OID can be assigned to program variables of the appropriate type when needed.\\nThe main property required of an OID is that it be immutable ; that is, the OID \\nvalue of a particular object should not change. This preserves the identity of the \\nreal-world object being represented. Hence, an ODMS must have some mechanism \\nfor generating OIDs and preserving the immutability property. It is also desirable that each OID be used only once; that is, even if an object is removed from the data-base, its OID should not be assigned to another object. These two properties imply that the OID should not depend on any attribute values of the object, since the value of an attribute may be changed or corrected. We can compare this with the relational model, where each relation must have a primary key attribute whose value identifies each tuple uniquely. If the value of the primary key is changed, the tuple will have a new identity, even though it may still represent the same real-world object. Alternatively, a real-world object may have different names for key attributes in different relations, making it difficult to ascertain that the keys repre-sent the same real-world object (for example, using the \\nEmp_id  of an EMPLOYEE in \\none relation and the Ssn in another).\\nIt is also inappropriate to base the OID on the physical address of the object in stor-\\nage, since the physical address can change after a physical reorganization of the \\ndatabase. However, some early ODMSs have used the physical address as the OID \\nto increase the efficiency of object retrieval. If the physical address of the object \\nchanges, an indirect pointer  can be placed at the former address, which gives the \\nnew physical location of the object. It is more common to use long integers as OIDs \\nand then to use some form of hash table to map the OID value to the current physi-\\ncal address of the object in storage.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 398}, page_content='368 Chapter 12 Object and Object-Relational Databases\\nSome early OO data models required that everything—from a simple value to a \\ncomplex object—was represented as an object; hence, every basic value, such as an integer, string, or Boolean value, has an OID. This allows two identical basic values to have different OIDs, which can be useful in some cases. For example, the integer value 50 can sometimes be used to mean a weight in kilograms and at other times to mean the age of a person. Then, two basic objects with distinct OIDs could be cre-ated, but both objects would have the integer 50 as their value. Although useful as a theoretical model, this is not very practical, since it leads to the generation of too many OIDs. Hence, most ODBs allow for the representation of both objects and literals  (or values). Every object must have an immutable OID, whereas a literal \\nvalue has no OID and its value just stands for itself. Thus, a literal value is typically stored within an object and cannot be referenced  from other objects. In many sys-\\ntems, complex structured literal values can also be created without having a corre-sponding OID if needed.\\n12.1.3 Complex Type Structures for Objects and Literals\\nAnother feature of ODBs is that objects and literals may have a type structure  of \\narbitrary complexity  in order to contain all of the necessary information that \\ndescribes the object or literal. In contrast, in traditional database systems, informa-\\ntion about a complex object is often scattered  over many relations or records, lead-\\ning to loss of direct correspondence between a real-world object and its database \\nrepresentation. In ODBs, a complex type may be constructed from other types by nesting  of type constructors . The three most basic constructors are atom, struct (or \\ntuple), and collection.\\n  1. One type constructor has been called the atom  constructor, although this \\nterm is not used in the latest object standard. This includes the basic built-in \\ndata types of the object model, which are similar to the basic types in many \\nprogramming languages: integers, strings, floating-point numbers, enumer-ated types, Booleans, and so on. These basic data types are called single-\\nvalued  or atomic  types, since each value of the type is considered an atomic \\n(indivisible) single value.\\n  2. A second type constructor is referred to as the struct  (or tuple ) constructor. \\nThis can create standard structured types, such as the tuples (record types) \\nin the basic relational model. A structured type is made up of several com-\\nponents and is also sometimes referred to as a compound  or composite  type. \\nMore accurately, the struct constructor is not considered to be a type, but rather a type generator , because many different structured types can be cre-\\nated. For example, two different structured types that can be created are: struct Name<FirstName: string, MiddleInitial: char, LastName: string>, and struct CollegeDegree<Major: string, Degree: string, Year: date>. To create complex nested type structures in the object model, the collection  type con-\\nstructors are needed, which we discuss next. Notice that the type construc-tors atom  and struct  are the only ones available in the original (basic) \\nrelational model.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 399}, page_content='12.1 Overview of Object Database Concepts  369\\n  3. Collection  (or multivalued ) type constructors include the set(T) , list(T) , \\nbag(T) , array(T) , and dictionary(K,T)  type constructors. These allow part \\nof an object or literal value to include a collection of other objects or values when needed. These constructors are also considered to be type generators  \\nbecause many different types can be created. For example, set( string ), \\nset(integer ), and set( Employee ) are three different types that can be created \\nfrom the set type constructor. All the elements in a particular collection \\nvalue must be of the same type. For example, all values in a collection of type set(string ) must be string values.\\nThe atom constructor  is used to represent all basic atomic values, such as integers, \\nreal numbers, character strings, Booleans, and any other basic data types that the system supports directly. The tuple constructor  can create structured values and \\nobjects of the form < a\\n1:i1, a2:i2, … , an:in>, where each aj is an attribute name6 and \\neach ij is a value or an OID.\\nThe other commonly used constructors are collectively referred to as collection \\ntypes but have individual differences among them. The set constructor  will create \\nobjects or literals that are a set of distinct  elements { i1, i2, … , in}, all of the same \\ntype. The bag constructor  (also called a multiset ) is similar to a set except that the \\nelements in a bag need not be distinct . The list constructor  will create an ordered list  \\n[i1, i2, … , in] of OIDs or values of the same type. A list is similar to a bag except that \\nthe elements in a list are ordered,  and hence we can refer to the first, second, or jth \\nelement. The array constructor  creates a single-dimensional array of elements of \\nthe same type. The main difference between array and list is that a list can have an \\narbitrary number of elements whereas an array typically has a maximum size. Finally, the dictionary constructor  creates a collection of key-value pairs ( K, V), \\nwhere the value of a key K can be used to retrieve the corresponding value V.\\nThe main characteristic of a collection type is that its objects or values will be a col-\\nlection of objects or values of the same type  that may be unordered (such as a set or a \\nbag) or ordered (such as a list or an array). The tuple  type constructor is often \\ncalled a structured type , since it corresponds to the struct  construct in the C and \\nC++ programming languages.\\nAn object definition language  (ODL )\\n7 that incorporates the preceding type con-\\nstructors can be used to define the object types for a particular database application. \\nIn Section 12.3 we will describe the standard ODL of ODMG, but first we introduce \\nthe concepts gradually in this section using a simpler notation. The type construc-tors can be used to define the data structures  for an OO database schema.  Fig- \\nure 12.1 shows how we may declare \\nEMPLOYEE  and DEPARTMENT  types.\\nIn Figure 12.1, the attributes that refer to other objects—such as Dept  of EMPLOYEE  \\nor Projects  of DEPARTMENT —are basically OIDs that serve as references  to other \\nobjects to represent relationships  among the objects. For example, the attribute Dept  \\n6Also called an instance variable name  in OO terminology.\\n7This corresponds to the DDL (data definition language) of the database system (see Chapter 2).'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 400}, page_content='370 Chapter 12 Object and Object-Relational Databases\\nof EMPLOYEE  is of type DEPARTMENT  and hence is used to refer to a specific \\nDEPARTMENT  object (the DEPARTMENT  object where the employee works). The \\nvalue of such an attribute would be an OID for a specific DEPARTMENT  object. A \\nbinary relationship can be represented in one direction, or it can have an inverse \\nreference.  The latter representation makes it easy to traverse the relationship in both \\ndirections. For example, in Figure 12.1 the attribute Employees  of DEPARTMENT  has \\nas its value a set of references  (that is, a set of OIDs) to objects of type EMPLOYEE ; \\nthese are the employees who work for the DEPARTMENT . The inverse is the refer-\\nence attribute Dept  of EMPLOYEE . We will see in Section 12.3 how the ODMG stan-\\ndard allows inverses to be explicitly declared as relationship attributes to ensure that inverse references are consistent.\\n12.1.4  Encapsulation of Operations  \\nand Persistence of Objects\\nEncapsulation of Operations. The concept of encapsulation  is one of the main \\ncharacteristics of OO languages and systems. It is also related to the concepts of \\nabstract data types  and information hiding  in programming languages. In tradi-\\ntional database models and systems this concept was not applied, since it is cus-tomary to make the structure of database objects visible to users and external programs. In these traditional models, a number of generic database operations define type  EMPLOYEE\\n tuple   ( Fname: string ;\\n  Minit : char;\\n  Lname: string ;\\n  Ssn: string ;\\n  Birth_date: DATE;\\n  Address: string ;\\n  Sex: char;\\n  Salary: float;\\n  Supervisor: EMPLOYEE;\\n  Dept: DEPARTMENT;\\ndefine type  DATE\\n tuple  ( Year: integer ;\\n  Month: integer ;\\n  Day: integer ; );\\ndefine type  DEPARTMENT\\n tuple  ( Dname: string ;\\n  Dnumber: integer ;\\n  Mgr: tuple  ( Manager: EMPLOYEE;\\n    Start_date: DATE; );\\n  Locations: set(string );\\n  Employees: set(EMPLOYEE);\\n  Projects: set(PROJECT); );Figure 12.1 \\nSpecifying the object types EMPLOYEE, DATE, and  DEPARTMENT using type constructors.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 401}, page_content='12.1 Overview of Object Database Concepts  371\\nare applicable to objects of all types . For example, in the relational model, the oper-\\nations for selecting, inserting, deleting, and modifying tuples are generic and may be applied to any relation  in the database. The relation and its attributes are visible \\nto users and to external programs that access the relation by using these opera-tions. The concept of encapsulation is applied to database objects in ODBs by defining the behavior  of a type of object based on the operations  that can be exter-\\nnally applied to objects of that type. Some operations may be used to create (insert) or destroy (delete) objects; other operations may update the object state; and oth-ers may be used to retrieve parts of the object state or to apply some calculations. Still other operations may perform a combination of retrieval, calculation, and update. In general, the implementation  of an operation can be specified in a \\n general-purpose programming language  that provides flexibility and power in \\ndefining the operations.\\nThe external users of the object are only made aware of the interface  of the oper-\\nations, which defines the name and arguments (parameters) of each operation. The implementation is hidden from the external users; it includes the definition of any hidden internal data structures of the object and the implementation of the operations that access these structures. The interface part of an operation is sometimes called the signature , and the operation implementation is sometimes \\ncalled the method .\\nFor database applications, the requirement that all objects be completely encapsu-\\nlated is too stringent. One way to relax this requirement is to divide the structure of an object into visible  and hidden  attributes (instance variables). Visible attributes \\ncan be seen by and are directly accessible to the database users and programmers via the query language. The hidden attributes of an object are completely encapsu-lated and can be accessed only through predefined operations. Most ODMSs employ high-level query languages for accessing visible attributes. In Section 12.5 we will describe the OQL query language that is proposed as a standard query lan-guage for ODBs.\\nThe term class  is often used to refer to a type definition, along with the definitions \\nof the operations for that type.\\n8 Figure 12.2 shows how the type definitions in Fig-\\nure 12.1 can be extended with operations to define classes. A number of operations \\nare declared for each class, and the signature (interface) of each operation is \\nincluded in the class definition. A method (implementation) for each operation must be defined elsewhere using a programming language. Typical operations include the object constructor  operation (often called new), which is used to create \\na new object, and the destructor  operation, which is used to destroy (delete) an \\nobject. A number of object modifier  operations can also be declared to modify the \\nstates (values) of various attributes of an object. Additional operations can retrieve  \\ninformation about the object.\\n8This definition of class  is similar to how it is used in the popular C++ programming language. The \\nODMG standard uses the word interface  in addition to class  (see Section 12.3). In the EER model, the \\nterm class  was used to refer to an object type, along with the set of all objects of that type (see  \\nChapter 8).'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 402}, page_content='372 Chapter 12 Object and Object-Relational Databases\\nAn operation is typically applied to an object by using the dot notation . For exam-\\nple, if d is a reference to a DEPARTMENT  object, we can invoke an operation such as \\nno_of_emps  by writing d.no_of_emps . Similarly, by writing d.destroy_dept , the object \\nreferenced by d is destroyed (deleted). The only exception is the constructor opera-\\ntion, which returns a reference to a new DEPARTMENT  object. Hence, it is custom-\\nary in some OO models to have a default name for the constructor operation that is the name of the class itself, although this was not used in Figure 12.2.\\n9 The dot nota tion \\nis also used to refer to attributes of an object—for example, by writing d.Dnumber  or \\nd.Mgr_Start_date .define class  EMPLOYEE\\n type tuple  ( Fname: string ;\\n   Minit: char;\\n   Lname: string ;\\n   Ssn: string ;\\n   Birth_date: DATE;\\n   Address: string ;\\n   Sex: char;\\n   Salary: float;\\n   Supervisor: EMPLOYEE;\\n   Dept: DEPARTMENT; );\\n operations  age: integer ;\\n   create_emp: EMPLOYEE;\\n   destroy_emp: boolean ;\\nend EMPLOYEE;\\ndefine class  DEPARTMENT \\n type tuple  ( Dname: string ;\\n   Dnumber: integer ;\\n   Mgr: tuple  ( Manager: EMPLOYEE;\\n               Start_date: DATE; );\\n   Locations: set (string );\\n   Employees: set (EMPLOYEE);\\n   Projects set(PROJECT); );\\n operations  no_of_emps: integer ;\\n   create_dept: DEPARTMENT;\\n   destroy_dept: boolean ;\\n   assign_emp(e: EMPLOYEE): boolean ;\\n   (* adds an employee to the department *)\\n   remove_emp(e: EMPLOYEE): boolean ;\\n   (* removes an employee from the department *)\\nend DEPARTMENT;Figure 12.2 \\nAdding operations to the definitions of EMPLOYEE and DEPARTMENT.\\n9Default names for the constructor and destructor operations exist in the C++ programming language. \\nFor example, for class EMPLOYEE, the default constructor name  is EMPLOYEE and the default  \\ndestructor name  is ~EMPLOYEE.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 403}, page_content='12.1 Overview of Object Database Concepts  373\\nSpecifying Object Persistence via Naming and Reachability. An ODBS is \\noften closely coupled with an object-oriented programming language (OOPL). The OOPL is used to specify the method (operation) implementations as well as other application code. Not all objects are meant to be stored permanently in the data-base. Transient objects  exist in the executing program and disappear once the pro-\\ngram terminates. Persistent objects  are stored in the database and persist after \\nprogram termination. The typical mechanisms for making an object persistent are naming  and reachability.\\nThe naming mechanism  involves giving an object a unique persistent name within \\na particular database. This persistent object name  can be given via a specific state-\\nment or operation in the program, as shown in Figure 12.3. The named persistent objects are used as entry points  to the database through which users and applica-\\ntions can start their database access. Obviously, it is not practical to give names to \\nall objects in a large database that includes thousands of objects, so most objects are \\nmade persistent by using the second mechanism, called reachability . The reach-\\nability mechanism works by making the object reachable from some other persis-tent object. An object B is said to be reachable  from an object A if a sequence of \\nreferences in the database lead from object A to object B.\\nIf we first create a named persistent object N, whose state is a set of objects of some \\nclass C, we can make objects of C persistent by adding them  to the set, thus making \\nthem reachable from N. Hence, N is a named object that defines a persistent  \\ncollection  of objects of class C. In the object model standard, N is called the extent  \\nof C (see Section 12.3).\\nFor example, we can define a class \\nDEPARTMENT_SET  (see Figure 12.3) whose \\nobjects are of type set(DEPARTMENT ).10 We can create an object of type  \\nDEPARTMENT_SET , and give it a persistent name ALL_DEPARTMENTS , as shown in \\nFigure 12.3. Any DEPARTMENT  object that is added to the set of ALL_DEPARTMENTS  \\nby using the add_dept  operation becomes persistent by virtue of its being reach-\\nable from ALL_DEPARTMENTS . As we will see in Section 12.3, the ODMG ODL \\nstandard gives the schema designer the option of naming an extent as part of class definition.\\nNotice the difference between traditional database models and ODBs in this respect. \\nIn traditional database models, such as the relational model, all objects are assumed \\nto be persistent. Hence, when a table such as \\nEMPLOYEE  is created in a relational \\ndatabase, it represents both the type declaration  for EMPLOYEE  and a persistent set  \\nof all EMPLOYEE  records (tuples). In the OO approach, a class declaration of \\nEMPLOYEE  specifies only the type and operations for a class of objects. The user \\nmust separately define a persistent object of type set( EMPLOYEE ) whose value is the \\ncollection of references  (OIDs) to all persistent EMPLOYEE  objects, if this is desired, \\nas shown in Figure 12.3.11 This allows transient and persistent objects to follow the \\n10As we will see in Section 12.3, the ODMG ODL syntax uses set<DEPARTMENT> instead of \\nset(DEPARTMENT).\\n11Some systems, such as POET, automatically create the extent for a class.'),\n",

In general, it is possible \\nto define several persistent collections for the same class definition, if desired.\\n12.1.5 Type Hierarchies and Inheritance\\nSimplified Model for Inheritance. Another main characteristic of ODBs is that \\nthey allow type hierarchies and inheritance. We use a simple OO model in this section—a model in which attributes and operations are treated uniformly—since both attributes and operations can be inherited. In Section 12.3, we will discuss the inheritance model of the ODMG standard, which differs from the model discussed here because it distinguishes between two types of inheritance . Inheritance allows \\nthe definition of new types based on other predefined types, leading to a type  (or \\nclass ) hierarchy .\\nA type is defined by assigning it a type name and then defining a number of attri-\\nbutes (instance variables) and operations (methods) for the type.\\n12 In the simplified \\nmodel we use in this section, the attributes and operations are together called func-\\ntions,  since attributes resemble functions with zero arguments. A function name \\ncan be used to refer to the value of an attribute or to refer to the resulting value of an \\noperation (method). We use the term function  to refer to both attributes and oper-\\nations, since they are treated similarly in a basic introduction to inheritance.13define class  DEPARTMENT_SET\\n type set  (DEPARTMENT);\\n operations  add_dept(d: DEPARTMENT): boolean ;\\n  (* adds a department to the DEPARTMENT_SET object *)\\n   remove_dept(d: DEPARTMENT): boolean ;\\n  (* removes a department from the DEPARTMENT_SET object *)\\n   create_dept_set: DEPARTMENT_SET;\\n   destroy_dept_set: boolean ;\\nend Department_Set;\\n…persistent name  ALL_DEPARTMENTS: DEPARTMENT_SET;\\n(* ALL_DEPARTMENTS is a persistent named object of type DEPARTMENT_SET *)…d:= create_dept;(* create a new DEPARTMENT object in the variable d *)…\\nb:= ALL_DEPARTMENTS.add_dept(d);\\n(* make d persistent by adding it to the persistent set ALL_DEPARTMENTS *)Figure 12.3 \\nCreating persistent \\nobjects by naming \\nand reachability.\\n12In this section we will use the terms type and class  as meaning the same thing—namely, the attributes \\nand operations of some type of object.\\n13We will see in Section 12.3 that types with functions are similar to the concept of interfaces as used in \\nODMG ODL.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 405}, page_content='12.1 Overview of Object Database Concepts  375\\nA type in its simplest form has a type name  and a list of visible ( public ) functions . \\nWhen specifying a type in this section, we use the following format, which does not specify arguments of functions, to simplify the discussion:\\nTYPE_NAME: function, function, … , function\\nFor example, a type that describes characteristics of a PERSON  may be defined as \\nfollows:\\nPERSON: Name, Address, Birth_date, Age, Ssn\\nIn the PERSON  type, the Name , Address , Ssn, and Birth_date  functions can be imple-\\nmented as stored attributes, whereas the Age function can be implemented as an \\noperation that calculates the Age from the value of the Birth_date  attribute and the \\ncurrent date.\\nThe concept of subtype  is useful when the designer or user must create a new type that \\nis similar but not identical to an already defined type. The subtype then inherits all the functions of the predefined type, which is referred to as the supertype . For example, \\nsuppose that we want to define two new types \\nEMPLOYEE  and STUDENT  as follows:\\nEMPLOYEE: Name, Address, Birth_date, Age, Ssn, Salary, Hire_date, Seniority\\nSTUDENT: Name, Address, Birth_date, Age, Ssn, Major, Gpa\\nSince both STUDENT  and EMPLOYEE  include all the functions defined for PERSON  \\nplus some additional functions of their own, we can declare them to be subtypes  of \\nPERSON . Each will inherit the previously defined functions of PERSON —namely, \\nName , Address , Birth_date , Age, and Ssn. For STUDENT , it is only necessary to define \\nthe new (local) functions Major  and Gpa, which are not inherited. Presumably, Major  \\ncan be defined as a stored attribute, whereas Gpa may be implemented as an opera-\\ntion that calculates the student’s grade point average by accessing the Grade  values \\nthat are internally stored (hidden) within each STUDENT  object as hidden attributes.  \\nFor EMPLOYEE , the Salary  and Hire_date  functions may be stored attributes, whereas \\nSeniority  may be an operation that calculates Seniority  from the value of Hire_date .\\nTherefore, we can declare EMPLOYEE  and STUDENT  as follows:\\nEMPLOYEE subtype-of  PERSON: Salary, Hire_date, Seniority\\nSTUDENT subtype-of  PERSON: Major, Gpa\\nIn general, a subtype includes all of the functions that are defined for its supertype \\nplus some additional functions that are specific  only to the subtype. Hence, it is pos-\\nsible to generate a type hierarchy  to show the supertype/subtype relationships \\namong all the types declared in the system.\\nAs another example, consider a type that describes objects in plane geometry, which \\nmay be defined as follows:\\nGEOMETRY_OBJECT: Shape, Area, Reference_point\\nFor the GEOMETRY_OBJECT  type, Shape  is implemented as an attribute (its domain \\ncan be an enumerated type with values ‘triangle’, ‘rectangle’, ‘circle’, and so on), and'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 406}, page_content='376 Chapter 12 Object and Object-Relational Databases\\nArea  is a method that is applied to calculate the area. Reference_point  specifies the \\ncoordinates of a point that determines the object location. Now suppose that we want to define a number of subtypes for the \\nGEOMETRY_OBJECT  type, as follows:\\nRECTANGLE subtype-of  GEOMETRY_OBJECT: Width, Height\\nTRIANGLE S subtype-of  GEOMETRY_OBJECT: Side1, Side2, Angle\\nCIRCLE subtype-of  GEOMETRY_OBJECT: Radius\\nNotice that the Area operation may be implemented by a different method for each \\nsubtype, since the procedure for area calculation is different for rectangles, trian-gles, and circles. Similarly, the attribute \\nReference_point  may have a different mean-\\ning for each subtype; it might be the center point for RECTANGLE  and CIRCLE  \\nobjects, and the vertex point between the two given sides for a TRIANGLE  object.\\nNotice that type definitions describe objects but do not  generate objects on their \\nown. When an object is created, typically it belongs to one or more of these types that have been declared. For example, a circle object is of type \\nCIRCLE  and  \\nGEOMETRY_OBJECT  (by inheritance). Each object also becomes a member of one \\nor more persistent collections of objects (or extents), which are used to group \\ntogether collections of objects that are persistently stored in the database.\\nConstraints on Extents Corresponding to a Type Hierarchy. In most ODBs, \\nan extent  is defined to store the collection of persistent objects for each type or sub-\\ntype. In this case, the constraint is that every object in an extent that corresponds to \\na subtype must also be a member of the extent  that corresponds to its supertype. \\nSome OO database systems have a predefined system type (called the ROOT  class or \\nthe OBJECT  class) whose extent contains all the objects in the system.14\\nClassification then proceeds by assigning objects into additional subtypes that are meaningful to the application, creating a type hierarchy  (or class hierarchy ) for the \\nsystem. All extents for system- and user-defined classes are subsets of the extent \\ncorresponding to the class \\nOBJECT , directly or indirectly. In the ODMG model (see \\nSection 12.3), the user may or may not specify an extent for each class (type), depending on the application.\\nAn extent is a named persistent object whose value is a persistent collection  that \\nholds a collection of objects of the same type that are stored permanently in the database. The objects can be accessed and shared by multiple programs. It is also possible to create a transient collection , which exists temporarily during the execu-\\ntion of a program but is not kept when the program terminates. For example, a transient collection may be created in a program to hold the result of a query that selects some objects from a persistent collection and copies those objects into the transient collection. The program can then manipulate the objects in the transient collection, and once the program terminates, the transient collection ceases to exist. In general, numerous collections—transient or persistent—may contain objects of the same type.\\n14This is called OBJECT in the ODMG model (see Section 12.3).'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 407}, page_content='12.1 Overview of Object Database Concepts  377\\nThe inheritance model discussed in this section is very simple. As we will see in Sec-\\ntion 12.3, the ODMG model distinguishes between type inheritance—called inter-\\nface inheritance  and denoted by a colon (:)—and the extent inheritance  \\nconstraint—denoted by the keyword EXTEND .\\n12.1.6 Other Object-Oriented Concepts\\nPolymorphism of Operations (Operator Overloading). Another characteris-\\ntic of OO systems in general is that they provide for polymorphism  of operations, \\nwhich is also known as operator overloading . This concept allows the same opera-\\ntor name  or symbol  to be bound to two or more different implementations  of the \\noperator, depending on the type of objects to which the operator is applied. A sim-ple example from programming languages can illustrate this concept. In some lan-guages, the operator symbol “+” can mean different things when applied to operands (objects) of different types. If the operands of “+” are of type integer , the \\noperation invoked is integer addition. If the operands of “+” are of type floating \\npoint , the operation invoked is floating-point addition. If the operands of “+” are of \\ntype set, the operation invoked is set union. The compiler can determine which \\noperation to execute based on the types of operands supplied.\\nIn OO databases, a similar situation may occur. We can use the \\nGEOMETRY_OBJECT  \\nexample presented in Section 12.1.5 to illustrate operation polymorphism15  \\nin ODB. In this example, the function Area  is declared for all objects of type  \\nGEOMETRY_OBJECT . However, the implementation of the method for Area  may \\ndiffer for each subtype of GEOMETRY_OBJECT . One possibility is to have a general \\nimplementation for calculating the area of a generalized GEOMETRY_OBJECT  (for \\nexample, by writing a general algorithm to calculate the area of a polygon) and then to rewrite more efficient algorithms to calculate the areas of specific types of geo-metric objects, such as a circle, a rectangle, a triangle, and so on. In this case, the \\nArea function is overloaded  by different implementations.\\nThe ODMS must now select the appropriate method for the Area function based on \\nthe type of geometric object to which it is applied. In strongly typed systems, this can be done at compile time, since the object types must be known. This is termed early  (or static ) binding . However, in systems with weak typing or no typing (such \\nas Smalltalk, LISP, PHP, and most scripting languages), the type of the object to which a function is applied may not be known until runtime. In this case, the func-tion must check the type of object at runtime and then invoke the appropriate method. This is often referred to as late (or dynamic ) binding .\\nMultiple Inheritance and Selective Inheritance.  Multiple inheritance  occurs \\nwhen a certain subtype T is a subtype of two (or more) types and hence inherits the \\nfunctions (attributes and methods) of both supertypes.

This leads to the creation of a type lattice  rather than a type hierarchy. \\nOne problem that can occur with multiple inheritance is that the supertypes from which the subtype inherits may have distinct functions of the same name, creating an ambiguity. For example, both \\nMANAGER  and ENGINEER  may have a function called \\nSalary . If the Salary  function is implemented by different methods in the MANAGER  \\nand ENGINEER  supertypes, an ambiguity exists as to which of the two is inherited by \\nthe subtype ENGINEERING_MANAGER . It is possible, however, that both ENGINEER  \\nand MANAGER  inherit Salary  from the same supertype (such as EMPLOYEE ) higher \\nup in the lattice. The general rule is that if a function is inherited from some com-\\nmon supertype,  then it is inherited only once. In such a case, there is no ambiguity; \\nthe problem only arises if the functions are distinct in the two supertypes.\\nThere are several techniques for dealing with ambiguity in multiple inheritance. \\nOne solution is to have the system check for ambiguity when the subtype is created, and to let the user explicitly choose which function is to be inherited at this time. A second solution is to use some system default. A third solution is to disallow mul-tiple inheritance altogether if name ambiguity occurs, instead forcing the user to change the name of one of the functions in one of the supertypes. Indeed, some OO systems do not permit multiple inheritance at all. In the object database standard (see Section 12.3), multiple inheritance is allowed for operation inheritance of interfaces, but is not allowed for \\nEXTENDS  inheritance of classes.\\nSelective inheritance  occurs when a subtype inherits only some of the functions of \\na supertype. Other functions are not inherited. In this case, an EXCEPT  clause may \\nbe used to list the functions in a supertype that are not to be inherited by the sub-\\ntype. The mechanism of selective inheritance is not typically provided in ODBs, but \\nit is used more frequently in artificial intelligence applications.16\\n12.1.7 Summary of Object Database Concepts\\nTo conclude this section, we give a summary of the main concepts used in ODBs and object-relational systems:\\n ■Object identity.  Objects have unique identities that are independent of their \\nattribute values and are generated by the ODB system.\\n ■Type constructors.  Complex object structures can be constructed by apply-\\ning in a nested manner a set of basic type generators/constructors, such as tuple, set, list, array, and bag.\\n ■Encapsulation of operations.  Both the object structure and the operations that \\ncan be applied to individual objects are included in the class/type definitions.\\n ■Programming language compatibility.  Both persistent and transient objects \\nare handled seamlessly. Objects are made persistent by being reachable from \\n16In the ODMG model, type inheritance refers to inheritance of operations only, not attributes (see \\nSection 12.3).'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 409}, page_content='12.2 Object Database Extensions to SQL  379\\na persistent collection (extent) or by explicit naming (assigning a unique \\nname by which the object can be referenced/retrieved).\\n ■Type hierarchies and inheritance.  Object types can be specified by using a \\ntype hierarchy, which allows the inheritance of both attributes and methods (operations) of previously defined types. Multiple inheritance is allowed in some models.\\n ■Extents.  All persistent objects of a particular class/type C can be stored in an \\nextent, which is a named persistent object of type set(C). Extents corre-sponding to a type hierarchy have set/subset constraints enforced on their collections of persistent objects.\\n ■Polymorphism and operator overloading.  Operations and method names \\ncan be overloaded to apply to different object types with different imple-mentations.\\nIn the following sections we show how these concepts are realized, first in the SQL \\nstandard (Section 12.2) and then in the ODMG standard (Section 12.3).\\n12.2 Object Database Extensions to SQL\\nWe introduced SQL as the standard language for RDBMSs in Chapters 6 and 7. As we discussed, SQL was first specified by Chamberlin and Boyce (1974) and under-went enhancements and standardization in 1989 and 1992. The language continued its evolution with a new standard, initially called SQL3 while being developed and later known as SQL:99 for the parts of SQL3 that were approved into the standard. Starting with the version of SQL known as SQL3, features from object databases were incorporated into the SQL standard. At first, these extensions were known as SQL/Object, but later they were incorporated in the main part of SQL, known as SQL/Foundation in SQL:2008.\\nThe relational model with object database enhancements is sometimes referred to \\nas the object-relational model . Additional revisions were made to SQL in 2003 and \\n2006 to add features related to XML (see Chapter 13).\\nThe following are some of the object database features that have been included in SQL:\\n ■Some type constructors  have been added to specify complex objects. These \\ninclude the row type , which corresponds to the tuple (or struct) constructor. \\nAn array type  for specifying collections is also provided. Other collection \\ntype constructors, such as set, list, and bag constructors, were not part of the \\noriginal SQL/Object specifications in SQL:99 but were later included in the standard in SQL:2008.\\n ■A mechanism for specifying object identity  through the use of reference \\ntype is included.\\n ■Encapsulation of operations  is provided through the mechanism of \\nuser-defined types (UDTs) that may include operations as part of their declaration. These are somewhat similar to the concept of abstract data'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 410}, page_content='380 Chapter 12 Object and Object-Relational Databases\\ntypes  that were developed in programming languages. In addition, the \\nconcept of user-defined routines (UDRs) allows the definition of general methods (operations).\\n ■Inheritance  mechanisms are provided using the keyword UNDER .\\nWe now discuss each of these concepts in more detail. In our discussion, we will \\nrefer to the example in Figure 12.4.\\n12.2.1  User-Defined Types Using CREATE TYPE  \\nand Complex Objects\\nTo allow the creation of complex-structured objects and to separate the declaration \\nof a class/type from the creation of a table (which is the collection of objects/rows and hence corresponds to the extent discussed in Section 12.1), SQL now provides user-defined types  (UDT s). In addition, four collection types have been included \\nto allow for collections (multivalued types and attributes) in order to specify com-plex-structured objects rather than just simple (flat) records. The user will create the UDTs for a particular application as part of the database schema. A UDT  may \\nbe specified in its simplest form using the following syntax:\\nCREATE TYPE  TYPE_NAME AS (<component declarations>);\\nFigure 12.4 illustrates some of the object concepts in SQL. We will explain the \\nexamples in this figure gradually as we explain the concepts. First, a UDT can be used as either the type for an attribute or as the type for a table. By using a UDT as the type for an attribute within another UDT, a complex structure for objects (tuples) in a table can be created, much like that achieved by nesting type construc-tors/generators as discussed in Section 12.1. This is similar to using the struct   \\ntype constructor of Section 12.1.3. For example, in Figure 12.4(a), the UDT \\nSTREET_ADDR_TYPE  is used as the type for the STREET_ADDR  attribute in the UDT \\nUSA_ADDR_TYPE . Similarly, the UDT USA_ADDR_TYPE  is in turn used as the type \\nfor the ADDR  attribute in the UDT PERSON_TYPE  in Figure 12.4(b). If a UDT does \\nnot have any operations, as in the examples in Figure 12.4(a), it is possible to use  the concept of \\nROW TYPE  to directly create a structured attribute by using the  \\nkeyword ROW . For example, we could use the following instead of declaring \\nSTREET_ADDR_TYPE  as a separate type as in Figure 12.4(a):\\nCREATE TYPE  USA_ADDR_TYPE AS (\\n STREET_ADDR ROW  ( NUMBER VARCHAR (5),\\n   STREET_NAME VARCHAR (25),\\n   APT_NO VARCHAR (5),\\n   SUITE_NO VARCHAR (5) ),\\n CITY VARCHAR (25),\\n ZIP VARCHAR (10)\\n );\\nTo allow for collection types in order to create complex-structured objects, four \\nconstructors are now included in SQL: ARRAY , MULTISET , LIST, and SET.

In the initial specifica-\\ntion of SQL/Object, only the ARRAY  type was specified, since it can be used to simu-\\nlate the other types, but the three additional collection types were included in a  later version of the SQL standard. In Figure 12.4(b), the \\nPHONES  attribute of  \\nPERSON_TYPE  has as its type an array whose elements are of the previously defined \\nUDT USA_PHONE_TYPE . This array has a maximum of four elements, meaning \\nthat we can store up to four phone numbers per person. An array can also have no maximum number of elements if desired.\\nAn array type can have its elements referenced using the common notation of \\nsquare brackets. For example, \\nPHONES[1]  refers to the first location value in a \\nPHONES  attribute (see Figure 12.4(b)). A built-in function CARDINALITY  can return \\nthe current number of elements in an array (or any other collection type). For example, \\nPHONES[ CARDINALITY  (PHONES)]  refers to the last element in the array.\\nThe commonly used dot notation is used to refer to components of a ROW TYPE  or \\na UDT. For example, ADDR.CITY  refers to the CITY  component of an ADDR  attribute \\n(see Figure 12.4(b)).\\n12.2.2 Object Identifiers Using Reference Types\\nUnique system-generated object identifiers can be created via the reference type  \\nusing the keyword REF. For example, in Figure 12.4(b), the phrase:\\nREF IS SYSTEM GENERATED\\nindicates that whenever a new PERSON_TYPE  object is created, the system will \\nassign it a unique system-generated identifier. It is also possible not to have a system-generated object identifier and use the traditional keys of the basic relational model if desired.\\nIn general, the user can specify that system-generated object identifiers for the indi-\\nvidual rows in a table should be created. By using the syntax:\\nREF IS  <OID_ATTRIBUTE> <VALUE_GENERATION_METHOD> ;\\nthe user declares that the attribute named < OID_ATTRIBUTE > will be used to identify \\nindividual tuples in the table. The options for < VALUE_GENERATION_ METHOD > \\nare SYSTEM GENERATED  or DERIVED . In the former case, the system will  \\nautomatically generate a unique identifier for each tuple. In the latter case, the traditional method of using the user-provided primary key value to identify tuples is applied.\\n12.2.3 Creating Tables Based on the UDTs\\nFor each UDT that is specified to be instantiable via the phrase INSTANTIABLE  (see \\nFigure 12.4(b)), one or more tables may be created. This is illustrated in Fig- ure 12.4(d), where we create a table \\nPERSON  based on the PERSON_TYPE  UDT. Notice \\nthat the UDTs in Figure 12.4(a) are noninstantiable  and hence can only be used as'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 414}, page_content='384 Chapter 12 Object and Object-Relational Databases\\ntypes for attributes, but not as a basis for table creation. In Figure 12.4(b), the attri-\\nbute PERSON_ID  will hold the system-generated object identifier whenever a new \\nPERSON  record (object) is created and inserted in the table.\\n12.2.4 Encapsulation of Operations\\nIn SQL, a user-defined type  can have its own behavioral specification by specifying \\nmethods (or operations) in addition to the attributes. The general form of a UDT specification with methods is as follows:\\nCREATE TYPE  <TYPE-NAME> (\\n  <LIST OF COMPONENT ATTRIBUTES AND THEIR TYPES>\\n  <DECLARATION OF FUNCTIONS (METHODS)>\\n);\\nFor example, in Figure 12.4(b), we declared a method Age()  that calculates the age of \\nan individual object of type PERSON_TYPE .\\nThe code for implementing the method still has to be written. We can refer to the \\nmethod implementation by specifying the file that contains the code for the method, or we can write the actual code within the type declaration itself (see Figure 12.4(b)).\\nSQL provides certain built-in functions for user-defined types. For a UDT called \\nTYPE_T , the constructor function  TYPE_T ( ) returns a new object of that type. In \\nthe new UDT object, every attribute is initialized to its default value. An observer \\nfunction  A is implicitly created for each attribute A to read its value. Hence, A(X) \\nor X.A returns the value of attribute A of TYPE_T  if X is a variable that refers to an \\nobject/row of type TYPE_T . A mutator function  for updating an attribute sets the \\nvalue of the attribute to a new value. SQL allows these functions to be blocked from public use; an \\nEXECUTE  privilege is needed to have access to these functions.\\nIn general, a UDT can have a number of user-defined functions associated with it. \\nThe syntax is\\nINSTANCE METHOD  <NAME> (<ARGUMENT_LIST>) RETURNS   \\n<RETURN_TYPE>;\\nTwo types of functions can be defined: internal SQL and external. Internal functions \\nare written in the extended PSM language of SQL (see Chapter 10). External func-tions are written in a host language, with only their signature (interface) appearing in the UDT definition. An external function definition can be declared as follows:\\nDECLARE EXTERNAL  <FUNCTION_NAME> <SIGNATURE>\\nLANGUAGE  <LANGUAGE_NAME>;\\nAttributes and functions in UDTs are divided into three categories:\\n ■PUBLIC (visible at the UDT interface)\\n ■PRIVATE (not visible at the UDT interface)\\n ■PROTECTED (visible only to subtypes)'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 415}, page_content='12.2 Object Database Extensions to SQL  385\\nIt is also possible to define virtual attributes as part of UDTs, which are computed \\nand updated using functions.\\n12.2.5 Specifying Inheritance and Overloading of Functions\\nIn SQL, inheritance can be applied to types or to tables; we will discuss the meaning of each in this section. Recall that we already discussed many of the principles of inheritance in Section 12.1.5. SQL has rules for dealing with type inheritance  \\n(specified via the \\nUNDER  keyword). In general, both attributes and instance meth-\\nods (operations) are inherited. The phrase NOT FINAL  must be included in a UDT if \\nsubtypes are allowed to be created under that UDT (see Figures 12.4(a) and (b), where \\nPERSON_TYPE , STUDENT_TYPE , and EMPLOYEE_TYPE  are declared to be \\nNOT FINAL ). Associated with type inheritance are the rules for overloading of func-\\ntion implementations and for resolution of function names. These inheritance rules can be summarized as follows:\\n ■All attributes are inherited.\\n ■The order of supertypes in the UNDER  clause determines the inheritance \\nhierarchy.\\n ■An instance of a subtype can be used in every context in which a supertype \\ninstance is used.\\n ■A subtype can redefine any function that is defined in its supertype, with the \\nrestriction that the signature be the same.\\n ■When a function is called, the best match is selected based on the types of all \\narguments.\\n ■For dynamic linking, the types of the parameters are considered at runtime.\\nConsider the following examples to illustrate type inheritance, which are illustrated \\nin Figure 12.4(c). Suppose that we want to create two subtypes of PERSON_TYPE : \\nEMPLOYEE_TYPE  and STUDENT_TYPE . In addition, we also create a subtype \\nMANAGER_TYPE  that inherits all the attributes (and methods) of EMPLOYEE_TYPE  \\nbut has an additional attribute DEPT_MANAGED . These subtypes are shown in \\nFigure 12.4(c).\\nIn general, we specify the local (specific) attributes and any additional specific \\nmethods for the subtype, which inherits the attributes and operations (methods) of its supertype.\\nAnother facility in SQL is table inheritance  via the supertable/subtable facility. \\nThis is also specified using the keyword \\nUNDER  (see Figure 12.4(d)). Here, a new \\nrecord that is inserted into a subtable, say the MANAGER  table, is also inserted into \\nits supertables EMPLOYEE  and PERSON . Notice that when a record is inserted in \\nMANAGER , we must provide values for all its inherited attributes. INSERT , DELETE , \\nand UPDATE  operations are appropriately propagated. Basically, table inheritance \\ncorresponds to the extent inheritance  discussed in Section 12.1.5. The rule is that a \\ntuple in a sub-table must also exist in its super-table to enforce the set/subset con-straint on the objects.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 416}, page_content='386 Chapter 12 Object and Object-Relational Databases\\n12.2.6 Specifying Relationships via Reference\\nA component attribute of one tuple may be a reference  (specified using the key-\\nword REF) to a tuple of another (or possibly the same) table. An example is shown \\nin Figure 12.4(e).\\nThe keyword SCOPE  specifies the name of the table whose tuples can be referenced \\nby the reference attribute. Notice that this is similar to a foreign key, except that the system-generated OID value is used rather than the primary key value.\\nSQL uses a dot notation  to build path expressions  that refer to the component \\nattributes of tuples and row types. However, for an attribute whose type is \\nREF, the \\ndereferencing symbol –> is used. For example, the query below retrieves employees \\nworking in the company named ‘ABCXYZ’ by querying the EMPLOYMENT  table:\\nSELECT  E.Employee–>NAME\\nFROM  EMPLOYMENT AS E\\nWHERE  E.Company–>COMP_NAME = ‘ABCXYZ’;\\nIn SQL, –> is used for dereferencing  and has the same meaning assigned to it in the \\nC programming language. Thus, if r is a reference to a tuple (object) and a is a com-\\nponent attribute in that tuple, then r –> a is the value of attribute a in that tuple.\\nIf several relations of the same type exist, SQL provides the SCOPE  keyword by \\nwhich a reference attribute may be made to point to a tuple within a specific table of \\nthat type.\\n12.3  The OD MG Object Model and the Object \\nDefinition Language ODL\\nAs we discussed in the introduction to Chapter 6, one of the reasons for the success \\nof commercial relational DBMSs is the SQL standard. The lack of a standard for ODBs for several years may have caused some potential users to shy away from con-verting to this new technology. Subsequently, a consortium of ODB vendors and users, called ODMG (Object Data Management Group), proposed a standard that is known as the ODMG-93 or ODMG 1.0 standard. This was revised into ODMG 2.0, and later to ODMG 3.0. The standard is made up of several parts, including the object model , the object definition language  (ODL ), the object query language  \\n(OQL ), and the bindings  to object-oriented programming languages.\\nIn this section, we describe the ODMG object model and the ODL. In Section 12.4, \\nwe discuss how to design an ODB from an EER conceptual schema. We will give an overview of OQL in Section 12.5, and the C++ language binding in Section 12.6. Examples of how to use ODL, OQL, and the C++ language binding will use the \\nUNIVERSITY  database example introduced in Chapter 4. In our description, we will \\nfollow the ODMG 3.0 object model as described in Cattell et al. (2000).17 It is \\n17The earlier versions of the object model were published in 1993 and 1997 .'),\n",

It is meant to provide a standard data model for object databases, just as SQL describes a standard data model for relational databases. It also provides a standard terminology in a field where the same terms were sometimes used to describe different concepts. We will try to adhere to the ODMG terminology in this chapter. Many of the concepts in the ODMG model have already been discussed in Section 12.1, and we assume the reader has read this section. We will point out whenever the ODMG terminology \\ndiffers from that used in Section 12.1.\\nObjects and Literals. Objects and literals are the basic building blocks of the \\nobject model. The main difference between the two is that an object has both an object identifier and a state  (or current value), whereas a literal has a value \\n(state) but no object identifier.\\n18 In either case, the value can have a complex \\nstructure. The object state can change over time by modifying the object value. A literal is basically a constant value, possibly having a complex structure, but it does not change.\\nAn object  has five aspects: identifier, name, lifetime, structure, and creation.\\n  1. The object identifier  is a unique system-wide identifier (or Object_id ).19 \\nEvery object must have an object identifier.\\n  2. Some objects may optionally be given a unique name  within a particular \\nODMS—this name can be used to locate the object, and the system should return the object given that name.\\n20 Obviously, not all individual objects \\nwill have unique names. Typically, a few objects, mainly those that hold collections of objects of a particular object class/type—such as extents —will \\nhave a name. These names are used as entry points  to the database; that is, \\nby locating these objects by their unique name, the user can then locate other objects that are referenced from these objects. Other important objects in the application may also have unique names, and it is possible to give more than one  name to an object. All names within a particular ODB \\nmust be unique.\\n18We will use the terms value  and state interchangeably here.\\n19This corresponds to the OID of Section 12.1.2.\\n20This corresponds to the naming mechanism for persistence, described in Section 12.1.4.'),\n",

The lifetime  of an object specifies whether it is a persistent object  (that is, a \\ndatabase object) or transient object  (that is, an object in an executing pro-\\ngram that disappears after the program terminates). Lifetimes are indepen-dent of classes/types—that is, some objects of a particular class may be transient whereas others may be persistent.\\n  4. The structure  of an object specifies how the object is constructed by using \\nthe type constructors. The structure specifies whether an object is atomic  or \\nnot. An atomic object  refers to a single object that follows a user-defined \\ntype, such as Employee  or Department . If an object is not atomic, then it will be \\ncomposed of other objects. For example, a collection object  is not an atomic \\nobject, since its state will be a collection of other objects.21 The term atomic \\nobject  is different from how we defined the atom constructor  in Sec- \\ntion 12.1.3, which referred to all values of built-in data types. In the ODMG model, an atomic object is any individual user-defined object . All values of \\nthe basic built-in data types are considered to be literals .\\n  5. Object creation  refers to the manner in which an object can be created. This \\nis typically accomplished via an operation new for a special Object_Factory  \\ninterface. We shall describe this in more detail later in this section.\\nIn the object model, a literal  is a value that does not have  an object identifier. How-\\never, the value may have a simple or complex structure. There are three types of literals: atomic, structured, and collection.\\n  1. Atomic literals22 correspond to the values of basic data types and are pre-\\ndefined. The basic data types of the object model include long, short, and \\nunsigned integer numbers (these are specified by the keywords long, short , \\nunsigned long , and unsigned short  in ODL), regular and double precision \\nfloating-point numbers ( float , double ), Boolean values ( boolean ), single \\ncharacters ( char), character strings ( string ), and enumeration types ( enum ), \\namong others.\\n  2. Structured literals  correspond roughly to values that are constructed using \\nthe tuple constructor described in Section 12.1.3. The built-in structured lit-\\nerals include Date , Interval , Time , and Timestamp  (see Figure 12.5(b)). Addi-\\ntional user-defined structured literals can be defined as needed by each \\napplication.23 User-defined structures are created using the STRUCT  key-\\nword in ODL, as in the C and C++ programming languages.\\n21In the ODMG model, atomic objects  do not correspond to objects whose values are basic data types. \\nAll basic values (integers, reals, and so on) are considered literals .\\n22The use of the word atomic  in atomic literal  corresponds to the way we used atom constructor in \\nSection 12.1.3.\\n23The structures for Date, Interval, Time, and Timestamp can be used to create either literal values or \\nobjects with identifiers.'),\n",

Collection literals  specify a literal value that is a collection of objects or \\nvalues but the collection itself does not have an Object_id . The collections \\nin the object model can be defined by the type generators  set<T>, bag<T>, \\nlist<T>, and array <T>, where T is the type of objects or values in the collec-\\ntion.24 Another collection type is dictionary <K, V >, which is a collection of \\nassociations < K, V >, where each K is a key (a unique search value) associ-\\nated with a value V; this can be used to create an index on a collection of \\nvalues V.\\nFigure 12.5 gives a simplified view of the basic types and type generators of the \\nobject model. The notation of ODMG uses three concepts: interface , literal , and \\nclass . Following the ODMG terminology, we use the word behavior  to refer to \\noperations  and state  to refer to properties  (attributes and relationships). An  \\ninterface  specifies only behavior of an object type and is typically noninstantiable  \\n(that is, no objects are created corresponding to an interface). Although an inter-face may have state properties (attributes and relationships) as part of its specifi-cations, these cannot  be inherited from the interface. Hence, an interface serves \\nto define operations that can be inherited  by other interfaces, as well as by classes \\nthat define the user-defined objects for a particular application. A class  specifies \\nboth state (attributes) and behavior (operations) of an object type and is instantiable . Hence, database and application objects are typically created based \\non the user-specified class declarations that form a database schema. Finally, a literal  declaration specifies state but no behavior. Thus, a literal instance holds a \\nsimple or complex structured value but has neither an object identifier nor encapsulated operations.\\nFigure 12.5 is a simplified version of the object model. For the full specifications, \\nsee Cattell et al. (2000). We will describe some of the constructs shown in Fig- ure 12.5 as we describe the object model. In the object model, all objects inherit the basic interface operations of \\nObject , shown in Figure 12.5(a); these include opera-\\ntions such as copy  (creates a new copy of the object), delete  (deletes the object), and \\nsame_as  (compares the object’s identity to another object).25 In general, operations \\nare applied to objects using the dot notation . For example, given an object O, to \\ncompare it with another object P, we write\\nO.same_as (P)\\nThe result returned by this operation is Boolean and would be true if the identity of \\nP is the same as that of O, and false otherwise. Similarly, to create a copy P of object \\nO, we write\\nP = O.copy ()\\nAn alternative to the dot notation is the arrow notation:  O–>same_as (P) or \\nO–>copy ().\\n24These are similar to the corresponding type constructors described in Section 12.1.3.\\n25Additional operations are defined on objects for locking  purposes, which are not shown in Figure 12.5. \\nWe discuss locking concepts for databases in Chapter 22.'),\n",

Behavior inheritance   \\nis also known as ISA or interface inheritance  and is specified by the colon (:) \\nnotation.26 Hence, in the ODMG object model, behavior inheritance requires \\nthe supertype to be an interface, whereas the subtype could be either a class or \\nanother interface.\\nThe other inheritance relationship, called EXTENDS  inheritance , is specified by the \\nkeyword extends . It is used to inherit both state and behavior strictly among classes, \\nso both the supertype and the subtype must be classes. Multiple inheritance via \\nextends  is not permitted. However, multiple inheritance is allowed for behavior \\ninheritance via the colon (:) notation. Hence, an interface may inherit behavior from several other interfaces. A class may also inherit behavior from several inter-faces via colon (:) notation, in addition to inheriting behavior and state from at \\nmost one  other class via \\nextends . In Section 12.3.4 we will give examples of how these \\ntwo inheritance relationships—“:” and extends —may be used.\\n12.3.3 Built-in Interfaces and Classes in the Object Model\\nFigure 12.5 shows the built-in interfaces of the object model. All interfaces, such as \\nCollection , Date , and Time , inherit the basic Object  interface. In the object model, \\nthere is a distinction between collections, whose state contains multiple objects or literals, versus atomic (and structured) objects, whose state is an individual object or literal. Collection objects  inherit the basic \\nCollection  interface shown in Fig- \\nure 12.5(c), which shows the operations for all collection objects. Given a collection object O, the O\\n.cardinality () operation returns the number of elements in the collec-\\ntion. The operation O.is_empty () returns true if the collection O is empty, and \\nreturns false otherwise. The operations O.insert_element (E) and O.remove_element (E) \\ninsert or remove an element E from the collection O. Finally, the operation  \\nO.contains_element (E) returns true if the collection O includes element E, and \\nreturns false otherwise. The operation I = O.create_iterator () creates an iterator \\nobject  I for the collection object O, which can iterate over each element in the  \\ncollection. The interface for iterator objects is also shown in Figure 12.5(c). The  I\\n.reset () operation sets the iterator at the first element in a collection (for an unor-\\ndered collection, this would be some arbitrary element), and I.next_position () sets the \\niterator to the next element. The I.get_element () retrieves the current element , \\nwhich is the element at which the iterator is currently positioned.\\nThe ODMG object model uses exceptions  for reporting errors or particular condi-\\ntions. For example, the ElementNotFound  exception in the Collection  interface would be \\nraised by the O.remove_element (E) operation if E is not an element in the collection O. \\n26The ODMG report also calls interface inheritance as type/subtype, is-a, and generalization/specializa-\\ntion relationships, although in the literature these terms have been used to describe inheritance of both state and operations (see Chapter 8 and Section 12.1).'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 424}, page_content='394 Chapter 12 Object and Object-Relational Databases\\nThe NoMoreElements  exception in the iterator interface would be raised by the  \\nI.next_position () operation if the iterator is currently positioned at the last element in \\nthe collection, and hence no more elements exist for the iterator to point to.\\nCollection  objects are further specialized into set, list, bag, array , and dictionary , which \\ninherit the operations of the Collection  interface. A set<T> type generator  can be \\nused to create objects such that the value of object O is a set whose elements are of \\ntype T.  The Set interface includes the additional operation P = O.create_union (S) \\n(see Figure 12.5(c)), which returns a new object P of type set<T> that is the union of \\nthe two sets O and S. Other operations similar to create_union  (not shown in Fig- \\nure 12.5(c)) are create_intersection (S) and create_difference (S). Operations for set com-\\nparison include the O.is_subset_of (S) operation, which returns true if the set object \\nO is a subset of some other set object S, and returns false otherwise. Similar opera-\\ntions (not shown in Figure 12.5(c)) are is_proper_subset_of (S), is_superset_of (S), and \\nis_proper_superset_of (S). The bag<T> type generator  allows duplicate elements in \\nthe collection and also inherits the Collection  interface. It has three operations—\\ncreate_union (b), create_intersection (b), and create_difference (b)—that all return a new \\nobject of type bag<T>.\\nA list<T> type generator  inherits the Collection  operations and can be used to create \\ncollections of objects of type T where the order of the elements is important. The \\nvalue of each such object O is an ordered list whose elements are of type T.  Hence, we \\ncan refer to the first, last, and ith element in the list. Also, when we add an element to \\nthe list, we must specify the position in the list where the element is inserted. Some of the \\nlist operations are shown in Figure 12.5(c). If O is an object of type list<T>, the \\noperation O.insert_element_first (E) inserts the element E before the first element in the \\nlist O, so that E becomes the first element in the list. A similar operation (not shown) \\nis O.insert_element_last (E). The operation O.insert_element_after (E, I) in Figure 12.5(c) \\ninserts the element E after the ith element in the list O and will raise the exception \\nInvalidIndex  if no ith element exists in O. A similar operation (not shown) is \\nO.insert_element_before (E, I). To remove elements from the list, the operations are  \\nE = O.remove_first_element (), E = O.remove_last_element (), and E = O.remove_element _at (I); \\nthese operations remove the indicated element from the list and return the element as \\nthe operation’s result. Other operations retrieve an element without removing it from \\nthe list. These are E = O.retrieve_first_element (), E = O.retrieve _last_element (), and  \\nE = O.retrieve_element_at (I). Also, two operations to manipulate lists are defined. They \\nare P = O.concat (I), which creates a new list P that is the concatenation of lists O and I \\n(the elements in list O followed by those in list I), and O.append (I), which appends \\nthe elements of list I to the end of list O (without creating a new list object).\\nThe array <T> type generator  also inherits the Collection  operations and is similar to \\nlist. Specific operations for an array  object O are O.replace_element_at (I, E), which \\nreplaces the array element at position I with element E; E = O.remove_element_at (I), \\nwhich retrieves the ith element and replaces it with a NULL  value; and  \\nE = O.retrieve_element_at (I), which simply retrieves the ith element of the array. Any \\nof these operations can raise the exception InvalidIndex  if I is greater than the array’s \\nsize. The operation O.resize (N) changes the number of array elements to N.'),\n",

This allows the cre-\\nation of a collection of association pairs < K,V>, where all K (key) values are unique. \\nMaking the key values unique allows for associative retrieval of a particular pair given its key value (similar to an index). If O is a collection object of type \\ndictionary <K,V>, then O.bind (K,V) binds value V to the key K as an association \\n<K,V> in the collection, whereas O.unbind (K) removes the association with key K \\nfrom O, and V = O.lookup (K) returns the value V associated with key K in O. The \\nlatter two operations can raise the exception KeyNotFound . Finally, O.contains_key (K) \\nreturns true if key K exists in O, and returns false otherwise.\\nFigure 12.6 is a diagram that illustrates the inheritance hierarchy of the built-in \\nconstructs of the object model. Operations are inherited from the supertype to the subtype. The collection interfaces described above are not directly instantiable ; that \\nis, one cannot directly create objects based on these interfaces. Rather, the inter-faces can be used to generate user-defined collection types—of type \\nset, bag, list, \\narray , or dictionary —for a particular database application. If an attribute or class has \\na collection type, say a set, then it will inherit the operations of the set interface. For \\nexample, in a UNIVERSITY  database application, the user can specify a type for \\nset<STUDENT >, whose state would be sets of STUDENT  objects. The programmer \\ncan then use the operations for set<T> to manipulate an object of type \\nset<STUDENT >. Creating application classes is typically done by utilizing the object \\ndefinition language ODL (see Section 12.3.6).\\nIt is important to note that all objects in a particular collection must be of the same \\ntype.  Hence, although the keyword any appears in the specifications of collection \\ninterfaces in Figure 12.5(c), this does not mean that objects of any type can be inter-mixed within the same collection. Rather, it means that any type can be used when specifying the type of elements for a particular collection (including other collec-tion types!).\\n12.3.4 Atomic (User-Defined) Objects\\nThe previous section described the built-in collection types of the object model.

In the object model, any user-defined \\nobject that is not a collection object is called an atomic object .27\\nFor example, in a UNIVERSITY  database application, the user can specify an object \\ntype (class) for STUDENT  objects. Most such objects will be structured objects ; for \\nexample, a STUDENT  object will have a complex structure, with many attributes, \\nrelationships, and operations, but it is still considered atomic because it is not a collection. Such a user-defined atomic object type is defined as a class by specify-ing its properties  and operations . The properties define the state of the object and \\nare further distinguished into attributes  and relationships . In this subsection, we \\nelaborate on the three types of components—attributes, relationships, and  operations—that a user-defined object type for atomic (structured) objects can include. We illustrate our discussion with the two classes \\nEMPLOYEE  and DEPARTMENT  \\nshown in Figure 12.7.\\nAn attribute  is a property that describes some aspect of an object. Attributes have \\nvalues (which are typically literals having a simple or complex structure) that are stored within the object. However, attribute values can also be \\nObject_id s of other \\nobjects. Attribute values can even be specified via methods that are used to calculate \\nthe attribute value. In Figure 12.728 the attributes for EMPLOYEE  are Name , Ssn, \\nBirth_date , Sex, and Age, and those for DEPARTMENT  are Dname , Dnumber , Mgr,  \\nLocations , and Projs . The Mgr and Projs  attributes of DEPARTMENT  have complex \\nstructure and are defined via struct , which corresponds to the tuple constructor  of \\nSection 12.1.3. Hence, the value of Mgr in each DEPARTMENT  object will have two \\ncomponents: Manager , whose value is an Object_id  that references the EMPLOYEE  \\nobject that manages the DEPARTMENT , and Start_date , whose value is a date. The \\nlocations attribute of DEPARTMENT  is defined via the set constructor, since each \\nDEPARTMENT  object can have a set of locations.\\nA relationship  is a property that specifies that two objects in the database are related. \\nIn the object model of ODMG, only binary relationships (see Section 3.4) are \\nexplicitly represented, and each binary relationship is represented by a pair of \\ninverse references  specified via the keyword relationship. In Figure 12.7, one rela-\\ntionship exists that relates each EMPLOYEE  to the DEPARTMENT  in which he or she \\nworks—the Works_for  relationship of EMPLOYEE . In the inverse direction, each \\nDEPARTMENT  is related to the set of EMPLOYEES  that work in the DEPARTMENT —\\nthe Has_emps  relationship of DEPARTMENT . The keyword inverse  specifies that \\nthese two properties define a single conceptual relationship in inverse directions.29\\nBy specifying inverses, the database system can maintain the referential integrity of the relationship automatically. That is, if the value of \\nWorks_for  for a particular \\n27As mentioned earlier, this definition of atomic object  in the ODMG object model is different from the \\ndefinition of atom constructor given in Section 12.1.3, which is the definition used in much of the object-oriented database literature.\\n28We are using the Object Definition Language (ODL) notation in Figure 12.7 , which will be discussed in \\nmore detail in Section 12.3.6.\\n29Section 7 .4 discusses how a relationship can be represented by two attributes in inverse directions.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 427}, page_content='12.3 The ODMG Object Model and the Object Definition Language ODL  397\\nEMPLOYEE  E refers to DEPARTMENT  D, then the value of Has_emps  for DEPARTMENT  \\nD must include a reference to E in its set of EMPLOYEE  references. If the database \\ndesigner desires to have a relationship to be represented in only one direction,  then \\nit has to be modeled as an attribute (or operation). An example is the Manager  com-\\nponent of the Mgr attribute in DEPARTMENT .\\nIn addition to attributes and relationships, the designer can include operations  in \\nobject type (class) specifications. Each object type can have a number of operation \\nsignatures , which specify the operation name, its argument types, and its returned \\nvalue, if applicable. Operation names are unique within each object type, but they can be overloaded by having the same operation name appear in distinct object types. The operation signature can also specify the names of exceptions  that  \\ncan occur during operation execution. The implementation of the operation  will include the code to raise these exceptions. In Figure 12.7 the \\nEMPLOYEE  class class EMPLOYEE\\n( extent ALL_EMPLOYEES\\n key Ssn )\\n{\\n attribute string Name;\\n attribute string Ssn;\\n attribute date Birth_date;\\n attribute enum Gender{M, F} Sex;\\n attribute short Age;\\n relationship DEPARTMENT Works_for\\n   inverse DEPARTMENT::Has_emps;\\n void reassign_emp(in string New_dname)\\n   raises(dname_not_valid);\\n};class DEPARTMENT( extent ALL_DEPARTMENTS\\n key Dname, Dnumber )\\n{\\n attribute string Dname;\\n attribute short Dnumber;\\n attribute struct Dept_mgr {EMPLOYEE Manager, date Start_date}\\n   Mgr;\\n attribute set<string> Locations;\\n attribute struct Projs {string Proj_name, time Weekly_hours)\\n   Projs;\\n relationship set<EMPLOYEE> Has_emps inverse EMPLOYEE::Works_for;\\n void add_emp(in string New_ename) raises(ename_not_valid);\\n void change_manager(in string New_mgr_name; in date\\n   Start_date);\\n};Figure 12.7 \\nThe attributes, relationships, and operations in a class definition.'),\n",

The extent  \\nis given a name, and it will contain all persistent objects of that class. Hence, the \\nextent  behaves as a set object  that holds all persistent objects of the class. In Fig- \\nure 12.7 the EMPLOYEE  and DEPARTMENT  classes have extents called ALL_EMPLOYEES  \\nand ALL_DEPARTMENTS , respectively. This is similar to creating two objects—one \\nof type set<EMPLOYEE > and the second of type set<DEPARTMENT >—and making \\nthem persistent by naming them ALL_EMPLOYEES  and ALL_DEPARTMENTS . Extents \\nare also used to automatically enforce the set/subset relationship between the extents of a supertype and its subtype. If two classes \\nA and B have extent s ALL_A  and \\nALL_B , and class B is a subtype of class A (that is, class B extends  class A), then the \\ncollection of objects in ALL_B  must be a subset of those in ALL_A  at any point. This \\nconstraint is automatically enforced by the database system.\\nA class with an extent can have one or more keys. A key consists of one or more \\nproperties (attributes or relationships) whose values are constrained to be unique for each object in the extent. For example, in Figure 12.7 the \\nEMPLOYEE  class has \\nthe Ssn attribute as key (each EMPLOYEE  object in the extent must have a unique \\nSsn value), and the DEPARTMENT  class has two distinct keys: Dname  and Dnumber  \\n(each DEPARTMENT  must have a unique Dname  and a unique Dnumber ). For a \\ncomposite key30 that is made of several properties, the properties that form the \\nkey are contained in parentheses. For example, if a class VEHICLE  with an extent  \\nALL_VEHICLES  has a key made up of a combination of two attributes State  and \\nLicense_number , they would be placed in parentheses as ( State , License_number ) in \\nthe key declaration.\\nNext, we present the concept of factory object —an object that can be used to gen-\\nerate or create individual objects via its operations. Some of the interfaces of factory objects that are part of the ODMG object model are shown in Figure 12.8. The interface \\nObjectFactory  has a single operation, new(), which returns a new object \\nwith an Object_id . By inheriting this interface, users can create their own factory \\ninterfaces for each user-defined (atomic) object type, and the programmer can implement the operation new differently for each type of object. Figure 12.8 also \\nshows a \\nDateFactory  interface, which has additional operations for creating a new \\ncalendar_date  and for creating an object whose value is the current_date , among other \\noperations (not shown in Figure 12.8). As we can see, a factory object basically pro-vides the constructor operations  for new objects.\\nFinally, we discuss the concept of a database . Because an ODB system can create \\nmany different databases, each with its own schema, the ODMG object model has \\n30A composite key is called a compound key  in the ODMG report.'),\n",

Its main use is to create object specifications—that is, classes and interfaces. Hence, ODL is not a programming language. A user can specify a database schema in ODL indepen-dently of any programming language, and then use the specific language bindings to specify how ODL constructs can be mapped to constructs in specific program-ming languages, such as C++, Smalltalk, and Java.

Finally, the class DEGREE  is used to represent the com-\\nposite, multivalued attribute degrees of GRAD_STUDENT  (see Figure 8.10).\\nBecause the previous example does not include any interfaces, only classes, we now \\nutilize a different example to illustrate interfaces and interface (behavior) inheri-tance. Figure 12.11(a) is part of a database schema for storing geometric objects. An interface \\nGeometryObject  is specified, with operations to calculate the perimeter  and \\narea of a geometric object, plus operations to translate  (move) and rotate  an object. \\nSeveral classes ( RECTANGLE , TRIANGLE , CIRCLE , …) inherit the GeometryObject  \\ninterface. Since GeometryObject  is an interface, it is noninstantiable —that is, no \\nobjects can be created based on this interface directly. However, objects of type \\nRECTANGLE , TRIANGLE , CIRCLE , … can be created, and these objects inherit all the \\noperations of the GeometryObject  interface. Note that with interface inheritance, \\nonly operations are inherited, not properties (attributes, relationships). Hence, if a property is needed in the inheriting class, it must be repeated in the class defini-tion, as with the \\nReference_point  attribute in Figure 12.11(b). Notice that the inher-\\nited operations can have different implementations in each class. For example, the \\nimplementations of the area and perimeter  operations may be different for \\nRECTANGLE , TRIANGLE , and CIRCLE .\\nMultiple inheritance  of interfaces by a class is allowed, as is multiple inheritance of \\ninterfaces by another interface. However, with extends  (class) inheritance, multiple \\ninheritance is not permitted.  Hence, a class can inherit via extends  from at most one \\nclass (in addition to inheriting from zero or more interfaces).\\n12.4 Object Database Conceptual Design\\nSection 12.4.1 discusses how object database (ODB) design differs from relational database (RDB) design. Section 12.4.2 outlines a mapping algorithm that can be used to create an ODB schema, made of ODMG ODL class definitions, from a con-ceptual EER schema.\\n12.4.1 Differences between Conceptual Design  \\nof ODB and RDB\\nOne of the main differences between ODB and RDB design is how relationships are \\nhandled. In ODB, relationships are typically handled by having relationship prop-\\nerties or reference attributes that include OID(s) of the related objects. These can be \\nconsidered as OID references  to the related objects. Both single references and col-\\nlections of references are allowed. References for a binary relationship can be \\n33This is similar to how an M:N relationship is mapped in the relational model (see Section 9.1) and in \\nthe legacy network model (see Appendix E).'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 436}, page_content='406 Chapter 12 Object and Object-Relational Databases\\ndeclared in a single direction, or in both directions, depending on the types of \\naccess expected. If declared in both directions, they may be specified as inverses of one another, thus enforcing the ODB equivalent of the relational referential integ-rity constraint.\\nIn RDB, relationships among tuples (records) are specified by attributes with \\nmatching values. These can be considered as value references  and are specified via \\nforeign keys,  which are values of primary key attributes repeated in tuples of the \\nreferencing relation. These are limited to being single-valued in each record because multivalued attributes are not permitted in the basic relational model. Thus, M:N relationships must be represented not directly, but as a separate relation (table), as discussed in Section 9.1.\\nMapping binary relationships that contain attributes is not straightforward in \\nODBs, since the designer must choose in which direction the attributes should be included. If the attributes are included in both directions, then redundancy in stor-age will exist and may lead to inconsistent data. Hence, it is sometimes preferable to use the relational approach of creating a separate table by creating a separate class to represent the relationship. This approach can also be used for n-ary relation-\\nships, with degree n > 2.\\nAnother major area of difference between ODB and RDB design is how inheritance \\nis handled. In ODB, these structures are built into the model, so the mapping is achieved by using the inheritance constructs, such as derived  (:) and \\nextends . In \\nrelational design, as we discussed in Section 9.2, there are several options to choose \\nfrom since no built-in construct exists for inheritance in the basic relational model. \\nIt is important to note, though, that object-relational and extended-relational sys-\\ntems are adding features to model these constructs directly as well as to include operation specifications in abstract data types (see Section 12.2).\\nThe third major difference is that in ODB design, it is necessary to specify the oper-\\nations early on in the design since they are part of the class specifications. Although it is important to specify operations during the design phase for all types of data-bases, the design of operations may be delayed in RDB design as it is not strictly required until the implementation phase.\\nThere is a philosophical difference between the relational model and the object \\nmodel of data in terms of behavioral specification. The relational model does not \\nmandate the database designers to predefine a set of valid behaviors or operations, whereas this is a tacit requirement in the object model. One of the claimed advan-tages of the relational model is the support of ad hoc queries and transactions, whereas these are against the principle of encapsulation.\\nIn practice, it is becoming commonplace to have database design teams apply \\nobject-based methodologies at early stages of conceptual design so that both the structure and the use or operations of the data are considered, and a complete spec-ification is developed during conceptual design. These specifications are then mapped into relational schemas, constraints, and behavioral artifacts such as trig-gers or stored procedures (see Sections 5.2 and 13.4).'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 437}, page_content='12.4 Object Database Conceptual Design  407\\n12.4.2 Mapping an EER Schema to an ODB Schema\\nIt is relatively straightforward to design the type declarations of object classes \\nfor an ODBMS from an EER schema that contains neither  categories nor n -ary \\nrelationships with n > 2. However, the operations of classes are not specified in \\nthe EER diagram and must be added to the class declarations after the struc-tural mapping is completed. The outline of the mapping from EER to ODL is as follows:\\nStep 1. Create an ODL class  for each EER entity type or subclass. The type of the \\nODL class should include all the attributes of the EER class.\\n34 Multivalued attributes  \\nare typically declared by using the set, bag, or list constructors.35 If the values of the \\nmultivalued attribute for an object should be ordered, the list constructor is chosen; if duplicates are allowed, the bag constructor should be chosen; otherwise, the set constructor is chosen. Composite attributes  are mapped into a tuple constructor (by \\nusing a struct declaration in ODL).\\nDeclare an extent for each class, and specify any key attributes as keys of the extent.Step 2. Add relationship properties or reference attributes for each binary relation-\\nship into the ODL classes that participate in the relationship. These may be created \\nin one or both directions. If a binary relationship is represented by references in both  \\ndirections, declare the references to be relationship properties that are inverses of one another, if such a facility exists.\\n36 If a binary relationship is represented by a \\nreference in only one direction, declare the reference to be an attribute in the refer-\\nencing class whose type is the referenced class name.\\nDepending on the cardinality ratio of the binary relationship, the relationship \\nproperties or reference attributes may be single-valued or collection types. They will be single-valued  for binary relationships in the 1:1 or N:1 directions; they will \\nbe collection types  (set-valued or list-valued\\n37) for relationships in the 1:N or \\nM:N direction. An alternative way to map binary M:N relationships is discussed in step 7.\\nIf relationship attributes exist, a tuple constructor (\\nstruct ) can be used to create a \\nstructure of the form < reference , relationship attributes >, which may be included \\ninstead of the reference attribute. However, this does not allow the use of the inverse \\nconstraint . Additionally, if this choice is represented in both directions,  the attribute \\nvalues will be represented twice, creating redundancy.\\n34This implicitly uses a tuple constructor at the top level of the type declaration, but in general, the tuple \\nconstructor is not explicitly shown in the ODL class declarations.\\n35Further analysis of the application domain is needed to decide which constructor to use because this \\ninformation is not available from the EER schema.\\n36The ODL standard provides for the explicit definition of inverse relationships. Some ODBMS products \\nmay not provide this support; in such cases, programmers must maintain every relationship explicitly by coding the methods that update the objects appropriately.\\n37The decision whether to use set or list is not available from the EER schema and must be determined \\nfrom the requirements.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 438}, page_content='408 Chapter 12 Object and Object-Relational Databases\\nStep 3. Include appropriate operations for each class. These are not available from \\nthe EER schema and must be added to the database design by referring to the origi-nal requirements. A constructor method should include program code that checks any constraints that must hold when a new object is created. A destructor method should check any constraints that may be violated when an object is deleted. Other methods should include any further constraint checks that are relevant.\\nStep 4. An ODL class that corresponds to a subclass in the EER schema inherits (via \\nextends ) the attributes, relationships, and methods of its superclass in the ODL \\nschema. Its specific  (local) attributes, relationship references, and operations are \\nspecified, as discussed in steps 1, 2, and 3.\\nStep 5. Weak entity types can be mapped in the same way as regular entity types. \\nAn alternative mapping is possible for weak entity types that do not participate in any relationships except their identifying relationship; these can be mapped as though they were composite multivalued attributes  of the owner entity type, by using \\nthe \\nset<struct <…>> or list<struct <…>> constructors. The attributes of the weak entity \\nare included in the struct <…> construct, which corresponds to a tuple constructor. \\nAttributes are mapped as discussed in steps 1 and 2.\\nStep 6. Categories (union types) in an EER schema are difficult to map to ODL. It is \\npossible to create a mapping similar to the EER-to-relational mapping (see Sec- \\ntion 9.2) by declaring a class to represent the category and defining 1:1 relationships \\nbetween the category and each of its superclasses.\\nStep 7. An n-ary relationship with degree n > 2 can be mapped into a separate class, \\nwith appropriate references to each participating class. These references are based on \\nmapping a 1:N relationship from each class that represents a participating entity \\ntype to the class that represents the n-ary relationship. An M:N binary relationship, \\nespecially if it contains relationship attributes, may also use this mapping option, if desired.\\nThe mapping has been applied to a subset of the \\nUNIVERSITY  database schema in \\nFigure 4.10 in the context of the ODMG object database standard. The mapped \\nobject schema using the ODL notation is shown in Figure 12.10.\\n12.5 The Object Query Language OQL\\nThe object query language OQL is the query language proposed for the ODMG \\nobject model. It is designed to work closely with the programming languages for \\nwhich an ODMG binding is defined, such as C++, Smalltalk, and Java. Hence, an \\nOQL query embedded into one of these programming languages can return objects \\nthat match the type system of that language. Additionally, the implementations of class operations in an ODMG schema can have their code written in these pro-gramming languages. The OQL syntax for queries is similar to the syntax of the relational standard query language SQL, with additional features for ODMG con-cepts, such as object identity, complex objects, operations, inheritance, polymor-phism, and relationships.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 439}, page_content='12.5 The Object Query Language OQL  409\\nIn Section 12.5.1 we will discuss the syntax of simple OQL queries and the concept \\nof using named objects or extents as database entry points. Then, in Section 12.5.2 we will discuss the structure of query results and the use of path expressions to tra-verse relationships among objects. Other OQL features for handling object identity, inheritance, polymorphism, and other object-oriented concepts are discussed in Section 12.5.3. The examples to illustrate OQL queries are based on the \\nUNIVERSITY  \\ndatabase schema given in Figure 12.10.\\n12.5.1  Simple OQL Queries, Database Entry Points,  \\nand Iterator Variables\\nThe basic OQL syntax is a select … from … where …  structure, as it is for SQL. For \\nexample, the query to retrieve the names of all departments in the college of  ‘Engineering’ can be written as follows:\\nQ0: select D.Dname\\n from  D in DEPARTMENTS\\n where  D.College  = ‘Engineering’;\\nIn general, an entry point  to the database is needed for each query, which can be \\nany named persistent object.  For many queries, the entry point is the name of the \\nextent  of a class. Recall that the extent name is considered to be the name of a persis-\\ntent object whose type is a collection (in most cases, a set) of objects from the class. \\nLooking at the extent names in Figure 12.10, the named object DEPARTMENTS  is of \\ntype set<DEPARTMENT >; PERSONS  is of type set<PERSON >; FACULTY  is of type \\nset<FACULTY >; and so on.\\nThe use of an extent name— DEPARTMENTS  in Q0—as an entry point refers to a \\npersistent collection of objects. Whenever a collection is referenced in an OQL query, we should define an iterator variable\\n38—D in Q0—that ranges over each \\nobject in the collection. In many cases, as in Q0, the query will select certain objects \\nfrom the collection, based on the conditions specified in the where  clause. In Q0, \\nonly persistent objects D in the collection of DEPARTMENTS  that satisfy the condi-\\ntion D.College  = ‘Engineering’ are selected for the query result. For each selected \\nobject D, the value of D.Dname  is retrieved in the query result. Hence, the type of the \\nresult  for Q0 is bag<string > because the type of each Dname  value is string  (even \\nthough the actual result is a set because Dname  is a key attribute). In general, the \\nresult of a query would be of type bag for select … from …  and of type set for select \\ndistinct … from …  , as in SQL (adding the keyword distinct  eliminates duplicates).\\nUsing the example in Q0, there are three syntactic options for specifying iterator \\nvariables:\\nD in DEPARTMENTS\\nDEPARTMENTS  D\\nDEPARTMENTS AS D\\n38This is similar to the tuple variables that range over tuples in SQL queries.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 440}, page_content='410 Chapter 12 Object and Object-Relational Databases\\nWe will use the first construct in our examples.39\\nThe named objects used as database entry points for OQL queries are not limited to \\nthe names of extents. Any named persistent object, whether it refers to an atomic (single) object or to a collection object, can be used as a database entry point.\\n12.5.2 Query Results and Path Expressions\\nIn general, the result of a query can be of any type that can be expressed in the ODMG object model. A query does not have to follow the \\nselect … from … where …  \\nstructure; in the simplest case, any persistent name on its own is a query, whose result is a reference to that persistent object. For example, the query\\nQ1: DEPARTMENTS;\\nreturns a reference to the collection of all persistent DEPARTMENT  objects, whose \\ntype is set<DEPARTMENT >. Similarly, suppose we had given (via the database bind \\noperation, see Figure 12.8) a persistent name CS_DEPARTMENT  to a single \\nDEPARTMENT  object (the Computer Science department); then, the query\\nQ1A:  CS_DEPARTMENT;\\nreturns a reference to that individual object of type DEPARTMENT . Once an entry point \\nis specified, the concept of a path expression  can be used to specify a path  to related \\nattributes and objects. A path expression typically starts at a persistent object name,  or at \\nthe iterator variable that ranges over individual objects in a collection. This name will be followed by zero or more relationship names or attribute names connected using the dot notation.  For example, referring to the \\nUNIVERSITY  database in Figure 12.10, \\nthe following are examples of path expressions, which are also valid queries in OQL:\\nQ2: CS_DEPARTMENT.Chair;\\nQ2A:  CS_DEPARTMENT.Chair.Rank;\\nQ2B: CS_DEPARTMENT.Has_faculty;\\nThe first expression Q2 returns an object of type FACULTY , because that is the type \\nof the attribute Chair  of the DEPARTMENT  class. This will be a reference to the  \\nFACULTY  object that is related to the DEPARTMENT  object whose persistent name is \\nCS_DEPARTMENT  via the attribute Chair ; that is, a reference to the FACULTY  object \\nwho is chairperson of the Computer Science department. The second expression \\nQ2A  is similar, except that it returns the Rank  of this FACULTY  object (the Computer \\nScience chair) rather than the object reference; hence, the type returned by Q2A  is \\nstring , which is the data type for the Rank  attribute of the FACULTY  class.\\nPath expressions Q2 and Q2A  return single values, because the attributes Chair  (of \\nDEPARTMENT ) and Rank  (of FACULTY ) are both single-valued and they are applied to \\na single object. The third expression, Q2B , is different; it returns an object of type \\nset<FACULTY > even when applied to a single object, because that is the type of the \\nrelationship Has_faculty  of the DEPARTMENT  class. The collection returned will include \\n39Note that the latter two options are similar to the syntax for specifying tuple variables in SQL queries.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 441}, page_content='12.5 The Object Query Language OQL  411\\na set of references to all FACULTY  objects that are related to the DEPARTMENT  object \\nwhose persistent name is CS_DEPARTMENT  via the relationship Has_faculty ; that is, a \\nset of references to all FACULTY  objects who are working in the Computer Science \\ndepartment. Now, to return the ranks of Computer Science faculty, we cannot  write\\nQ3′: CS_DEPARTMENT.Has_faculty.Rank;\\nbecause it is not clear whether the object returned would be of type set<string > or \\nbag<string > (the latter being more likely, since multiple faculty may share the same \\nrank). Because of this type of ambiguity problem, OQL does not allow expressions such as \\nQ3′. Rather, one must use an iterator variable over any collections, as in \\nQ3A  or Q3B  below:\\nQ3A:  select  F.Rank\\n from  F in CS_DEPARTMENT.Has_faculty;\\nQ3B:  select  distinct  F.Rank\\n from  F in CS_DEPARTMENT.Has_faculty;\\nHere, Q3A  returns bag<string > (duplicate rank values appear in the result), whereas \\nQ3B  returns set<string > (duplicates are eliminated via the distinct  keyword). Both \\nQ3A  and Q3B  illustrate how an iterator variable can be defined in the from clause to \\nrange over a restricted collection specified in the query. The variable F in Q3A  and \\nQ3B  ranges over the elements of the collection CS_DEPARTMENT.Has_faculty , which \\nis of type set<FACULTY >, and includes only those faculty who are members of the \\nComputer Science department.\\nIn general, an OQL query can return a result with a complex structure specified in \\nthe query itself by utilizing the struct  keyword. Consider the following examples:\\nQ4: CS_DEPARTMENT.Chair.Advises;\\nQ4A:  select struct  ( name: struct  ( last_name:  S.name.Lname, first_name:  \\nS.name.Fname),\\n     degrees:( select struct  ( deg: D.Degree, \\nyr: D.Year, \\ncollege:  D.College)\\n        from  D in S.Degrees ))\\n from  S in CS_DEPARTMENT.Chair.Advises;\\nHere, Q4 is straightforward, returning an object of type set<GRAD_STUDENT > as its \\nresult; this is the collection of graduate students who are advised by the chair of the \\nComputer Science department. Now, suppose that a query is needed to retrieve the \\nlast and first names of these graduate students, plus the list of previous degrees of \\neach. This can be written as in Q4A , where the variable S ranges over the collection \\nof graduate students advised by the chairperson, and the variable D ranges over the \\ndegrees of each such student S. The type of the result of Q4A  is a collection of (first-\\nlevel) struct s where each struct has two components: name  and degrees .40\\n40As mentioned earlier, struct corresponds to the tuple constructor discussed in Section 12.1.3.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 442}, page_content='412 Chapter 12 Object and Object-Relational Databases\\nThe name  component is a further struct made up of last_name  and first_name , each \\nbeing a single string. The degrees component is defined by an embedded query and is itself a collection of further (second level) structs, each with three string compo-nents: \\ndeg, yr, and college .\\nNote that OQL is orthogonal  with respect to specifying path expressions. That is, \\nattributes, relationships, and operation names (methods) can be used interchange-ably within the path expressions, as long as the type system of OQL is not compro-mised. For example, one can write the following queries to retrieve the grade point average of all senior students majoring in Computer Science, with the result ordered by GPA, and within that by last and first name:\\nQ5A:  select struct  (  last_name:  S.name.Lname, first_name:  S.name.Fname, \\ngpa: S.gpa )\\n from  S in CS_DEPARTMENT.Has_majors\\n where  S.Class  = ‘senior’\\n order by  gpa desc , last_name asc, first_name asc;\\nQ5B:  select struct  (  last_name:  S.name.Lname, first_name:  S.name.Fname,  \\ngpa: S.gpa )\\n from   S in STUDENTS\\n where  S.Majors_in.Dname  = ‘Computer Science’ and\\n  S.Class  = ‘senior’\\n order by  gpa desc , last_name asc, first_name asc;\\nQ5A  used the named entry point CS_DEPARTMENT  to directly locate the reference \\nto the Computer Science department and then locate the students via the relation-\\nship Has_majors , whereas Q5B  searches the STUDENTS  extent to locate all students \\nmajoring in that department. Notice how attribute names, relationship names, and \\noperation (method) names are all used interchangeably (in an orthogonal manner) \\nin the path expressions: gpa is an operation; Majors_in  and Has_majors  are relation-\\nships; and Class , Name , Dname , Lname , and Fname  are attributes. The implementa-\\ntion of the gpa operation computes the grade point average and returns its value as \\na float type for each selected STUDENT .\\nThe order by  clause is similar to the corresponding SQL construct, and specifies in \\nwhich order the query result is to be displayed. Hence, the collection returned by a query with an \\norder by  clause is of type list.\\n12.5.3 Other Features of OQL\\nSpecifying Views as Named Queries. The view mechanism in OQL uses the \\nconcept of a named query . The define  keyword is used to specify an identifier of the \\nnamed query, which must be a unique name among all named objects, class names, \\nmethod names, and function names in the schema. If the identifier has the same \\nname as an existing named query, then the new definition replaces the previous \\ndefinition. Once defined, a query definition is persistent until it is redefined or \\ndeleted. A view can also have parameters (arguments) in its definition.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 443}, page_content='12.5 The Object Query Language OQL  413\\nFor example, the following view V1 defines a named query Has_minors  to retrieve \\nthe set of objects for students minoring in a given department:\\nV1: define  Has_minors(Dept_name) as\\n select  S\\n from  S in STUDENTS\\n where  S.Minors_in.Dname  = Dept_name;\\nBecause the ODL schema in Figure 12.10 only provided a unidirectional Minors_in  \\nattribute for a STUDENT , we can use the above view to represent its inverse without \\nhaving to explicitly define a relationship. This type of view can be used to represent inverse relationships that are not expected to be used frequently. The user can now utilize the above view to write queries such as\\nHas_minors (‘Computer Science’);\\nwhich would return a bag of students minoring in the Computer Science depart-\\nment. Note that in Figure 12.10, we defined Has_majors  as an explicit relationship, \\npresumably because it is expected to be used more often.\\nExtracting Single Elements from Singleton Collections. An OQL query will, \\nin general, return a collection  as its result, such as a bag, set (if distinct  is specified), or \\nlist (if the order by  clause is used). If the user requires that a query only return a sin-\\ngle element, there is an element  operator in OQL that is guaranteed to return a  \\nsingle element E from a singleton collection C that contains only one element. If C \\ncontains more than one element or if C is empty, then the element operator raises \\nan exception.  For example, Q6 returns the single object reference to the Computer \\nScience department:\\nQ6: element  ( select  D\\n    from  D in DEPARTMENTS\\n    where  D.Dname  = ‘Computer Science’ );\\nSince a department name is unique across all departments, the result should be one \\ndepartment. The type of the result is D:DEPARTMENT .\\nCollection Operators (Aggregate Functions, Quantifiers). Because many \\nquery expressions specify collections as their result, a number of operators have been defined that are applied to such collections. These include aggregate operators as well as membership and quantification (universal and existential) over a collection.\\nThe aggregate operators (\\nmin, max, count , sum, avg) operate over a collection.41 The \\noperator count  returns an integer type. The remaining aggregate operators ( min, \\nmax, sum, avg) return the same type as the type of the operand collection. Two \\nexamples follow. The query Q7 returns the number of students minoring in Com-\\nputer Science and Q8 returns the average GPA of all seniors majoring in Computer \\nScience.\\n41These correspond to aggregate functions in SQL.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 444}, page_content='414 Chapter 12 Object and Object-Relational Databases\\nQ7: count  ( S in Has_minors( ‘Computer Science’ ));\\nQ8: avg ( select  S.Gpa\\n  from  S in STUDENTS\\n  where  S.Majors_in.Dname  = ‘Computer Science’ and \\n   S.Class  = ‘Senior’ );\\nNotice that aggregate operations can be applied to any collection of the appropriate \\ntype and can be used in any part of a query. For example, the query to retrieve all department names that have more than 100 majors can be written as in \\nQ9:\\nQ9: select  D.Dname\\n from  D in DEPARTMENTS\\n where  count  (D.Has_majors)  > 100;\\nThe membership  and quantification  expressions return a Boolean type—that is, true or \\nfalse. Let V be a variable, C a collection expression, B an expression of type Boolean (that \\nis, a Boolean condition), and E an element of the type of elements in collection C. Then:\\n(E in C) returns true if element E is a member of collection C.\\n(for all  V in C : B) returns true if all the elements of collection C satisfy B.\\n(exists  V in C : B) returns true if there is at least one element in C satisfying B.\\nTo illustrate the membership condition, suppose we want to retrieve the names of \\nall students who completed the course called ‘Database Systems I’. This can be writ-ten as in \\nQ10, where the nested query returns the collection of course names that \\neach STUDENT  S has completed, and the membership condition returns true if \\n‘Database Systems I’ is in the collection for a particular STUDENT  S:\\nQ10:  select  S.name.Lname, S.name.Fname\\n from  S in STUDENTS\\n where  ‘Database Systems I’ in\\n  ( select  C.Section.Of_course.Cname\\n    from  C in S.Completed_sections);\\nQ10 also illustrates a simpler way to specify the select  clause of queries that return a \\ncollection of structs; the type returned by Q10 is bag<struct (string , string )>.\\nOne can also write queries that return true/false results. As an example, let us \\nassume that there is a named object called JEREMY  of type STUDENT . Then, query \\nQ11 answers the following question: Is Jeremy a Computer Science minor?  Similarly, \\nQ12  answers the question Are all Computer Science graduate students advised by \\nComputer Science faculty?  Both Q11 and Q12 return true or false, which are inter-\\npreted as yes or no answers to the above questions:\\nQ11:  JEREMY in Has_minors( ‘Computer Science’ );\\nQ12:  for all  G in\\n  ( select  S\\n    from  S in GRAD_STUDENTS\\n    where  S.Majors_in.Dname  = ‘Computer Science’ )\\n  : G.Advisor in CS_DEPARTMENT.Has_faculty;'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 445}, page_content='12.5 The Object Query Language OQL  415\\nNote that query Q12  also illustrates how attribute, relationship, and operation \\ninheritance applies to queries. Although S is an iterator that ranges over the extent  \\nGRAD_STUDENTS , we can write S.Majors_in  because the Majors_in  relationship is \\ninherited by GRAD_STUDENT  from STUDENT  via extends  (see Figure 12.10). Finally, \\nto illustrate the exists  quantifier, query Q13 answers the following question: Does \\nany graduate Computer Science major have a 4.0 GPA?  Here, again, the operation \\ngpa is inherited by GRAD_STUDENT  from STUDENT  via extends .\\nQ13:  exists  G in\\n ( select  S\\n   from  S in GRAD_STUDENTS\\n   where  S.Majors_in.Dname  = ‘Computer Science’ )\\n : G.Gpa = 4;\\nOrdered (Indexed) Collection Expressions. As we discussed in Section 12.3.3, \\ncollections that are lists and arrays have additional operations, such as retrieving the ith, first, and last elements. Additionally, operations exist for extracting a sub-\\ncollection and concatenating two lists. Hence, query expressions that involve lists or arrays can invoke these operations. We will illustrate a few of these operations using sample queries. \\nQ14 retrieves the last name of the faculty member who earns \\nthe highest salary:\\nQ14:  first ( select  struct (facname:  F.name.Lname, salary:  F.Salary)\\n  from  F in FACULTY\\n  order by  salary desc  );\\nQ14 illustrates the use of the first operator on a list collection that contains the sala-\\nries of faculty members sorted in descending order by salary. Thus, the first element \\nin this sorted list contains the faculty member with the highest salary. This query \\nassumes that only one faculty member earns the maximum salary. The next query, \\nQ15, retrieves the top three Computer Science majors based on GPA.\\nQ15:  ( select  struct (  last_name:  S.name.Lname, first_name:  S.name.Fname,  \\ngpa: S.Gpa )\\n   from  S in CS_DEPARTMENT.Has_majors\\n   order by  gpa desc  ) [0:2] ;\\nThe select-from-order-by  query returns a list of Computer Science students ordered \\nby GPA in descending order. The first element of an ordered collection has an index position of 0, so the expression \\n[0:2]  returns a list containing the first, second, \\nand third elements of the select … from … order by …  result.\\nThe Grouping Operator. The group by  clause in OQL, although similar to the \\ncorresponding clause in SQL, provides explicit reference to the collection of objects \\nwithin each group  or partition.  First we give an example, and then we describe the \\ngeneral form of these queries.\\nQ16 retrieves the number of majors in each department. In this query, the students \\nare grouped into the same partition (group) if they have the same major; that is, the \\nsame value for S.Majors_in.Dname :'),\n",

The select  clause returns the grouping \\nattribute (name of the department), and a count of the number of elements in each partition (that is, the number of students in each department), where \\npartition  is the \\nkeyword used to refer to each partition. The result type of the select  clause is \\nset<struct (dept_name: string , number_of_majors: integer )>. In general, the syntax for \\nthe group  by clause is\\ngroup by  F1: E1, F2: E2, … , Fk: Ek\\nwhere F1: E1, F2: E2, … , Fk: Ek is a list of partitioning (grouping) attributes and each \\npartitioning attribute specification Fi: Ei defines an attribute (field) name Fi and an \\nexpression Ei.

Q17 retrieves for each department having more than 100 majors, the \\naverage GPA of its majors.

This is done via a C++ class library that provides classes and operations that implement the ODL constructs. An object manipulation language (OML) is needed to specify how database objects are retrieved and manipulated within a C++ program, and this is based on the C++ programming language syntax and semantics. In addition to the ODL/OML bindings, a set of constructs called physi-\\ncal pragmas  are defined to allow the programmer some control over physical stor-\\nage issues, such as clustering of objects, utilizing indexes, and memory management.\\nThe class library added to C++ for the ODMG standard uses the prefix \\nd_ for \\nclass declarations that deal with database concepts.42 The goal is that the pro-\\ngrammer should think that only one language is being used, not two separate languages. For the programmer to refer to database objects in a program, a class \\nD_Ref <T> is defined for each database class T in the schema. Hence, program \\nvariables of type D_Ref <T> can refer to both persistent and transient objects of \\nclass T.\\nIn order to utilize the various built-in types in the ODMG object model such as \\ncollection types, various template classes are specified in the library. For example, an abstract class \\nD_Object <T> specifies the operations to be inherited by all objects. \\nSimilarly, an abstract class D_Collection <T> specifies the operations of collections. \\nThese classes are not instantiable, but only specify the operations that can be inherited by all objects and by collection objects, respectively. A template class is specified for each type of collection; these include \\nD_Set <T>, D_List <T>,  \\nD_Bag <T>, D_Varray <T>, and D_Dictionary <T>, and they correspond to the collection \\ntypes in the object model (see Section 12.3.1). Hence, the programmer can create classes of types such as \\nD_Set <D_Ref <STUDENT >> whose instances would be sets \\nof references to STUDENT  objects, or D_Set <string > whose instances would be sets \\nof strings. Additionally, a class d_Iterator  corresponds to the Iterator  class of the \\nobject model.\\nThe C++ ODL allows a user to specify the classes of a database schema using  \\nthe constructs of C++ as well as the constructs provided by the object database  \\nlibrary. For specifying the data types of attributes,43 basic types such as d_Short  \\n(short integer), d_Ushort  (unsigned short integer), d_Long  (long integer), and  \\nd_Float  (floating-point number) are provided. In addition to the basic data types, \\nseveral structured literal types are provided to correspond to the structured literal types of the ODMG object model. These include \\nd_String , d_Interval , d_Date,  d_Time , \\nand d_Timestamp  (see Figure 12.5(b)).\\n42Presumably, d_ stands for database  classes.\\n43That is, member variables  in object-oriented programming terminology.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 448}, page_content='418 Chapter 12 Object and Object-Relational Databases\\nTo specify relationships, the keyword rel_ is used within the prefix of type names; \\nfor example, by writing\\nd_Rel_Ref<DEPARTMENT , Has_majors> Majors_in ;\\nin the STUDENT  class, and\\nd_Rel_Set<STUDENT , Majors_in> Has_majors ;\\nin the DEPARTMENT  class, we are declaring that Majors_in  and Has_majors  are rela-\\ntionship properties that are inverses of one another and hence represent a 1:N binary relationship between \\nDEPARTMENT  and STUDENT .\\nFor the OML, the binding overloads the operation new so that it can be used to \\ncreate either persistent or transient objects. To create persistent objects, one must provide the database name and the persistent name of the object. For example, by writing\\nD_Ref<STUDENT>  S = new(DB1, ‘John_Smith’) STUDENT ;\\nthe programmer creates a named persistent object of type STUDENT  in database \\nDB1  with persistent name John_Smith . Another operation, delete_object () can be \\nused to delete objects. Object modification is done by the operations (methods) \\ndefined in each class by the programmer.\\nThe C++ binding also allows the creation of extents by using the library class  \\nd_Extent . For example, by writing\\nD_Extent<PERSON> ALL_PERSONS (DB1);\\nthe programmer would create a named collection object ALL_PERSONS —whose \\ntype would be D_Set <PERSON >—in the database DB1  that would hold persistent \\nobjects of type PERSON . However, key constraints are not supported in the C++ \\nbinding, and any key checks must be programmed in the class methods.44 Also, \\nthe C++ binding does not support persistence via reachability; the object must be \\nstatically declared to be persistent at the time it is created.\\n12.7 Summary\\nIn this chapter, we started in Section 12.1 with an overview of the concepts utilized in object databases, and we discussed how these concepts were derived from gen-eral object-oriented principles. The main concepts we discussed were: object iden-tity and identifiers; encapsulation of operations; inheritance; complex structure of objects through nesting of type constructors; and how objects are made persistent. \\n44We have only provided a brief overview of the C++ binding. For full details, see Cattell et al. (2000), \\nChapter 5.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 449}, page_content='12.7 Summary  419\\nThen, in Section 12.2, we showed how many of these concepts were incorporated \\ninto the relational model and the SQL standard; we showed that this incorporation leads to expanded relational database functionality. These systems have been called object-relational databases.\\nWe then discussed the ODMG 3.0 standard for object databases. We started by \\ndescribing the various constructs of the object model in Sction 12.3. The various \\nbuilt-in types, such as \\nObject , Collection , Iterator , set, list, and so on, were described by \\ntheir interfaces, which specify the built-in operations of each type. These built-in types are the foundation upon which the object definition language (ODL) and object query language (OQL) are based. We also described the difference between objects, which have an ObjectId, and literals, which are values with no OID. Users can declare classes for their application that inherit operations from the appropriate built-in interfaces. Two types of properties can be specified in a user-defined class—attributes and relationships—in addition to the operations that can be applied to objects of the class. The ODL allows users to specify both interfaces and classes, and permits two different types of inheritance—interface inheritance via “:” and class inheritance via \\nextends . A class can have an extent and keys. A description of ODL \\nfollowed, and an example database schema for the UNIVERSITY  database was used to \\nillustrate the ODL constructs.\\nFollowing the description of the ODMG object model, we described a general tech-\\nnique for designing object database schemas in Section 12.4. We discussed how object databases differ from relational databases in three main areas: references to represent relationships, inclusion of operations, and inheritance. Finally, we showed how to map a conceptual database design in the EER model to the con-structs of object databases.\\nIn Section 12.5, we presented an overview of the object query language (OQL). The \\nOQL follows the concept of orthogonality in constructing queries, meaning that an operation can be applied to the result of another operation as long as the type of the result is of the correct input type for the operation. The OQL syntax follows many of the constructs of SQL but includes additional concepts such as path expressions, inheritance, methods, relationships, and collections. Examples of how to use OQL \\nover the \\nUNIVERSITY  database were given.\\nNext we gave an overview of the C++ language binding in Section 12.6, which \\nextends C++ class declarations with the ODL type constructors but permits seam-less integration of C++ with the ODBMS.\\nIn 1997 Sun endorsed the ODMG API (Application Program Interface). O2 tech-\\nnologies was the first corporation to deliver an ODMG-compliant DBMS. Many \\nODBMS vendors, including Object Design (now eXcelon), Gemstone Systems, POET \\nSoftware, and Versant Corporation\\n45, have endorsed the ODMG standard.\\n45The Versant Object Technology product now belongs to Actian Corporation.'),\n",

These databases are often referred to as data sources . It is common \\nto use the three-tier client/server architectures for Internet applications (see Sec-tion 2.5). Internet database applications are designed to interact with the user through Web interfaces that display Web pages on desktops, laptops, and mobile devices. The common method of specifying the contents and formatting of Web pages is through the use of hypertext documents . There are various languages for writing \\nthese documents, the most common being HTML (HyperText Markup Language). Although HTML is widely used for formatting and structuring Web documents , it \\nis not suitable for specifying structured data  that is extracted from databases. A new \\nlanguage—namely, XML (Extensible Markup Language)—has emerged as the stan-dard for structuring and exchanging data over the Web in text files. Another lan-guage that can be used for the same purpose is JSON (JavaScript Object Notation; see Section 11.4). XML can be used to provide information about the structure and meaning of the data in the Web pages rather than just specifying how the Web pages are formatted for display on the screen. Both XML and JSON documents provide descriptive information, such as attribute names, as well as the values of these attributes, in a text file; hence, they are known as self-describing documents . \\nThe formatting aspects of Web pages are specified separately—for example, by \\nusing a formatting language such as XSL (Extensible Stylesheet Language) or a \\ntransformation language such as XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language for Trans-\\nformations or simply XSL Transformations). Recently, XML has also been pro-\\nposed as a possible model for data storage and retrieval, although only a few \\nexperimental database systems based on XML have been developed so far.chapter 13'),\n",

Such Web pages are called dynamic  \\nWeb pages, because the data extracted and displayed each time will be different depending on user input. For example, a banking app would get the user’s account number, then extract the balance for that user’s account from the database for dis-play. We discussed how scripting languages, such as PHP, can be used to generate dynamic Web pages for applications such as those presented in Chapter 11. XML can be used to transfer information in self-describing textual files among various programs on different computers when needed by the applications.\\nIn this chapter, we will focus on describing the XML data model and its associated \\nlanguages, and how data extracted from relational databases can be formatted as XML documents to be exchanged over the Web. Section 13.1 discusses the differ-ence among structured, semistructured, and unstructured data. Section 13.2 pres-ents the XML data model, which is based on tree (hierarchical) structures as compared to the flat relational data model structures. In Section 13.3, we focus on the structure of XML documents and the languages for specifying the structure of these documents, such as DTD (Document Type Definition) and XML Schema. Section 13.4 shows the relationship between XML and relational databases. Sec-tion 13.5 describes some of the languages associated with XML, such as XPath and XQuery. Section 13.6 discusses how data extracted from relational databases can be formatted as XML documents. In Section 13.7, we discuss the new functions that \\nhave been incorporated into XML for the purpose of generating XML documents from relational databases. Finally, Section 13.8 is the chapter summary.\\n13.1  Structured, Semistructured,  \\nand Unstructured Data\\nThe information stored in relational databases is known as structured data  because \\nit is represented in a strict format. For example, each record in a relational database table—such as each of the tables in the \\nCOMPANY  database in Figure 5.6—follows \\nthe same format as the other records. For structured data, it is common to carefully design the database schema using techniques such as those described in Chapters 3 and 4 in order to define the database structure. The DBMS then checks to ensure that all data follows the structures and constraints specified in the schema.\\nHowever, not all data is collected and inserted into carefully designed structured \\ndatabases. In some applications, data is collected in an ad hoc manner before it is known how it will be stored and managed. This data may have a certain structure, but not all the information collected will have the identical structure. Some attri-butes may be shared among the various entities, but other attributes may exist only in a few entities. Moreover, additional attributes can be introduced in some of the newer data items at any time, and there is no predefined schema. This type of data is known as semistructured data . A number of data models have been introduced'),\n",

In semistructured data, the schema information is mixed in  with the \\ndata values, since each data object can have different attributes that are not known \\nin advance. Hence, this type of data is sometimes referred to as self-describing \\ndata . Many of the newer NOSQL systems adopt self-describing storage schemes \\n(see Chapter 24). Consider the following example. We want to collect a list of bib-liographic references related to a certain research project. Some of these may be books or technical reports, others may be research articles in journals or conference proceedings, and still others may refer to complete journal issues or conference proceedings. Clearly, each of these may have different attributes and different types of information. Even for the same type of reference—say, conference articles—we may have different information. For example, one article citation may be com-plete, with full information about author names, title, proceedings, page numbers, and so on, whereas another citation may not have all the information available. New types of bibliographic sources may appear in the future—for instance, references to Web pages or to conference tutorials—and these may have new attributes that describe them.\\nOne model for displaying semistructured data is a directed graph, as shown in \\nFigure 13.1. The information shown in Figure 13.1 corresponds to some of the structured data shown in Figure 5.6. As we can see, this model somewhat resem-bles the object model (see Section 12.1.3) in its ability to represent complex objects and nested structures. In Figure 13.1, the labels  or tags  on the directed edges \\nrepresent the schema names: the names of attributes, object types ( or entity types  \\nLocation NumberProject ProjectCompany projects\\nName\\n‘Bellaire’ 1 ‘Product X’Worker Worker\\nHours Last_\\nnameSsnHoursFirst_\\nnameSsn\\n32.5 ‘Smith’ ‘123456789’ 20.0 ‘Joyce’ ‘435435435’Figure 13.1 \\nRepresenting  semistructured data  as a graph.'),\n",

The internal nodes represent individual objects or \\ncomposite attributes. The leaf nodes represent actual data values of simple (atomic) attributes.\\nThere are two main differences between the semistructured model and the object \\nmodel that we discussed in Chapter 12:\\n  1. The schema information—names of attributes, relationships, and classes (object types) in the semistructured model—is intermixed with the objects and their data values in the same data structure.\\n  2. In the semistructured model, there is no requirement for a predefined schema to which the data objects must conform, although it is possible to define a schema if necessary. The object model of Chapter 12 requires a schema.\\nIn addition to structured and semistructured data, a third category exists, known as \\nunstructured data  because there is very limited indication of the type of data. A \\ntypical example is a text document that contains information embedded within it. Web pages in HTML that contain some data are considered to be unstructured data. Consider part of an HTML file, shown in Figure 13.2. Text that appears between angled brackets, <…>, is an HTML tag . A tag with a slash, </…>, indicates \\nan end tag , which represents the ending of the effect of a matching start tag . The \\ntags mark up  the document\\n1 in order to instruct an HTML processor how to dis-\\nplay the text between a start tag and a matching end tag. Hence, the tags specify document formatting rather than the meaning of the various data elements in the document. HTML tags specify information, such as font size and style (boldface, italics, and so on), color, heading levels in documents, and so on. Some tags provide text structuring in documents, such as specifying a numbered or unnumbered list or a table. Even these structuring tags specify that the embedded textual data is to be displayed in a certain manner rather than indicating the type of data represented in \\nthe table.\\nHTML uses a large number of predefined tags, which are used to specify a variety of \\ncommands for formatting Web documents for display. The start and end tags spec-ify the range of text to be formatted by each command. A few examples of the tags shown in Figure 13.2 follow:\\n ■The < HTML > … < /HTML > tags specify the boundaries of the document.\\n ■The document header  information—within the < HEAD > … < /HEAD > \\ntags—specifies various commands that will be used elsewhere in the docu-ment. For example, it may specify various script functions  in a language \\nsuch as JavaScript or PERL, or certain formatting styles  (fonts, paragraph \\nstyles, header styles, and so on) that can be used in the document. It can also specify a title to indicate what the HTML file is for, and other similar infor-mation that will not be displayed as part of the document.\\n1That is why it is known as HyperText Markup  Language.'),\n",

The following < TD> and < FONT > start tags have one and two \\nattributes, respectively.\\nHTML has a very large number of predefined tags, and whole books are devoted to \\ndescribing how to use these tags. If designed properly, HTML documents can be formatted so that humans are able to easily understand the document contents and are able to navigate through the resulting Web documents. However, the source HTML text documents are very difficult to interpret automatically by computer pro-\\ngrams  because they do not include schema information about the type of data in the \\ndocuments. As e-commerce and other Internet applications become increasingly automated, it is becoming crucial to be able to exchange Web documents among various computer sites and to interpret their contents automatically. This need was one of the reasons that led to the development of XML. In addition, an extendible version of HTML called XHTML was developed that allows users to extend the tags of HTML for different applications and allows an XHTML file to be interpreted by standard XML processing programs. Our discussion will focus on XML only.\\nThe example in Figure 13.2 illustrates a static  HTML page, since all the information \\nto be displayed is explicitly spelled out as fixed text in the HTML file. In many cases, some of the information to be displayed may be extracted from a database. For example, the project names and the employees working on each project may be extracted from the database in Figure 5.6 through the appropriate SQL query. We may want to use the same HTML formatting tags for displaying each project and the employees who work on it, but we may want to change the particular projects (and employees) being displayed. For example, we may want to see a Web page displaying the information for ProjectX , and then later a page displaying the information for \\nProjectY . Although both pages are displayed using the same HTML formatting tags, \\nthe actual data items displayed will be different. Such Web pages are called dynamic , \\nsince the data parts of the page may be different each time it is displayed, even though \\nthe display appearance is the same. We discussed in Chapter 11 how scripting lan-\\nguages, such as PHP, can be used to generate dynamic Web pages.\\n13.2 X ML Hierarchical (Tree) Data Model\\nWe now introduce the data model used in XML. The basic object in XML is the XML \\ndocument. Two main structuring concepts are used to construct an XML document: elements  and attributes . It is important to note that the term attribute  in XML is not \\n2<TR> stands for table row and <TD> stands for table data.\\n3This is how the term attribute  is used in document markup languages, which differs from how it is used \\nin database models.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 461}, page_content='13.2 XML Hierarchical (Tree) Data Model  431\\nused in the same manner as is customary in database terminology , but rather as it is used \\nin document description languages such as HTML and SGML.4 Attributes in XML \\nprovide additional information that describes elements, as we will see. There are addi-\\ntional concepts in XML, such as entities, identifiers, and references, but first we concen-trate on describing elements and attributes to show the essence of the XML model.\\nFigure 13.3 shows an example of an XML element called \\n<Projects> . As in HTML, \\nelements are identified in a document by their start tag and end tag. The tag names are enclosed between angled brackets < … >, and end tags are further identified by a slash, </ … >.\\n5\\nComplex elements  are constructed from other elements hierarchically, whereas \\nsimple elements  contain data values. A major difference between XML and HTML \\nis that XML tag names are defined to describe the meaning of the data elements in the document rather than to describe how the text is to be displayed. This makes it possible to process the data elements in the XML document automatically by com-puter programs. Also, the XML tag (element) names can be defined in another doc-ument, known as the schema document , to give a semantic meaning to the tag \\nnames that can be exchanged among multiple programs and users. In HTML, all tag names are predefined and fixed; that is why they are not extendible.\\nIt is straightforward to see the correspondence between the XML textual representa-\\ntion shown in Figure 13.3 and the tree structure shown in Figure 13.1. In the tree representation, internal nodes represent complex elements, whereas leaf nodes rep-resent simple elements. That is why the XML model is called a tree model  or a  \\nhierarchical model . In Figure 13.3, the simple elements are the ones with the tag \\nnames \\n<Name> , <Number> , <Location> , <Dept_no> , <Ssn> , <Last_name> , <First_name> , \\nand <Hours> . The complex elements are the ones with the tag names <Projects> ,  \\n<Project> , and <Worker> . In general, there is no limit on the levels of nesting of elements.\\nIt is possible to characterize three main types of XML documents:\\n ■Data-centric XML documents.  These documents have many small data \\nitems that follow a specific structure and hence may be extracted from a \\nstructured database. They are formatted as XML documents in order to \\nexchange them over the Web. These usually follow a predefined schema  that \\ndefines the tag names.\\n ■Document-centric XML documents.  These are documents with large \\namounts of text, such as news articles or books. There are few or no struc-tured data elements in these documents.\\n ■Hybrid XML documents.  These documents may have parts that contain \\nstructured data and other parts that are predominantly textual or unstruc-\\ntured. They may or may not have a predefined schema.\\n4SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) is a more general language for describing documents \\nand provides capabilities for specifying new tags. However, it is more complex than HTML and XML.\\n5The left and right angled bracket characters (< and >) are reserved characters, as are the ampersand \\n(&), apostrophe (’), and single quotation mark (‘). To include them within the text of a document, they must be encoded with escapes as &lt;, &gt;, &amp;, &apos;, and &quot;, respectively.'),\n",

It is impor-\\ntant to note that data-centric XML documents can be considered either as \\nsemistructured data or as structured data as defined in Section 13.1. If an XML \\ndocument conforms to a predefined XML schema or DTD (see Section 13.3), then \\nthe document can be considered as structured data . On the other hand, XML allows'),\n",

When the value of the \\nstandalone  attribute in an XML document is yes, as in the first line in Figure 13.3, \\nthe document is standalone and schemaless.\\nXML attributes are generally used in a manner similar to how they are used in \\nHTML (see Figure 13.2), namely, to describe properties and characteristics of the elements (tags) within which they appear. It is also possible to use XML attributes \\nto hold the values of simple data elements; however, this is generally not recom-\\nmended. An exception to this rule is in cases that need to reference  another ele-\\nment in another part of the XML document. To do this, it is common to use attribute values in one element as the references. This resembles the concept of for-eign keys in relational databases, and it is a way to get around the strict hierarchical \\nmodel that the XML tree model implies. We discuss XML attributes further in Sec-\\ntion 13.3 when we discuss XML schema and DTD.\\n13.3 X ML Documents, DTD, and X ML Schema\\n13.3.1  Well-Formed and Valid XML Documents and XML DTD\\nIn Figure 13.3, we saw what a simple XML document may look like. An XML docu-\\nment is well formed  if it follows a few conditions. In particular, it must start with an \\nXML declaration  to indicate the version of XML being used as well as any other \\nrelevant attributes, as shown in the first line in Figure 13.3. It must also follow the syntactic guidelines of the tree data model. This means that there should be a single \\nroot element , and every element must include a matching pair of start and end tags \\nwithin  the start and end tags of the parent element . This ensures that the nested ele-\\nments specify a well-formed tree structure.\\nA well-formed XML document is syntactically correct. This allows it to be pro-\\ncessed by generic processors that traverse the document and create an internal tree representation. A standard model with an associated set of API (application pro-gramming interface) functions called DOM  (Document Object Model) allows pro-\\ngrams to manipulate the resulting tree representation corresponding to a well-formed XML document. However, the whole document must be parsed beforehand when using DOM in order to convert the document to that standard DOM internal data structure representation. Another API called SAX  (Simple API \\nfor XML) allows processing of XML documents on the fly by notifying the process-ing program through callbacks whenever a start or end tag is encountered. This makes it easier to process large documents and allows for processing of so-called streaming XML documents , where the processing program can process the tags as \\nthey are encountered. This is also known as event-based processing . There are also \\nother specialized processors that work with various programming and scripting \\nlanguages for parsing XML documents.\\nA well-formed XML document can be schemaless; that is, it can have any tag \\nnames for the elements within the document. In this case, there is no predefined'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 464}, page_content='434 Chapter 13 XML: Extensible Markup Language\\nset of elements (tag names) that a program processing the document knows to \\nexpect. This gives the document creator the freedom to specify new elements but limits the possibilities for automatically interpreting the meaning or semantics of the elements within the document.\\nA stronger criterion is for an XML document to be valid . In this case, the document \\nmust be well formed, and it must follow a particular schema. That is, the element \\nnames used in the start and end tag pairs must follow the structure specified in a \\nseparate XML DTD  (Document Type Definition ) file or XML schema file . We \\nfirst discuss XML DTD here, and then we give an overview of XML schema in Sec-tion 13.3.2. Figure 13.4 shows a simple XML DTD file, which specifies the elements (tag names) and their nested structures. Any valid documents conforming to this DTD should follow the specified structure. A special syntax exists for specifying DTD files, as illustrated in Figure 13.4(a). First, a name is given to the root tag  of \\nthe document, which is called \\nProjects  in the first line in Figure 13.4. Then the ele-\\nments and their nested structure are specified.\\nWhen specifying elements, the following notation is used:\\n ■A * following the element name means that the element can be repeated zero \\nor more times in the document. This kind of element is known as an optional \\nmultivalued (repeating) element.\\n ■A + following the element name means that the element can be repeated one \\nor more times in the document. This kind of element is a required multival-\\nued (repeating) element.\\n ■A ? following the element name means that the element can be repeated zero \\nor one times. This kind is an optional single-valued (nonrepeating) element.\\n ■An element appearing without any of the preceding three symbols must \\nappear exactly once in the document. This kind is a required single-valued \\n(nonrepeating) element.\\n ■The type  of the element is specified via parentheses following the element. If \\nthe parentheses include names of other elements, these latter elements are \\nthe children  of the element in the tree structure. If the parentheses include \\nthe keyword #PCDATA  or one of the other data types available in XML DTD, \\nthe element is a leaf node. PCDATA  stands for parsed character data , which is \\nroughly similar to a string data type.\\n ■The list of attributes that can appear within an element can also be specified \\nvia the keyword !ATTLIST . In Figure 13.3, the Project  element has an attribute \\nProjId . If the type of an attribute is ID, then it can be referenced from another \\nattribute whose type is IDREF  within another element. Notice that attributes \\ncan also be used to hold the values of simple data elements of type #PCDATA .\\n ■Parentheses can be nested when specifying elements.\\n ■A bar symbol ( e1 | e2 ) specifies that either e1 or e2 can appear in the document.\\nWe can see that the tree structure in Figure 13.1 and the XML document in Fig-\\nure 13.3 conform to the XML DTD in Figure 13.4.

The Employee element has an attribute DeptId of type IDREF, which is a reference to the Department element where the employee works; this is similar to a foreign key. The Project element has an attribute Workers of type IDREFS, which will hold a list of Employee EmpIDs that work on that project; this is similar to a collection or list of foreign keys. The #IMPLIED keyword means that this attribute is optional. It is also possible to provide a default value for any attribute.\\nAlthough XML DTD is adequate for specifying tree structures with required, \\noptional, and repeating elements, and with various types of attributes, it has several limitations. First, the data types in DTD are not very general. Second, DTD has its own special syntax and thus requires specialized processors. It would be advanta-geous to specify XML schema documents using the syntax rules of XML itself so that the same processors used for XML documents could process XML schema descriptions. Third, all DTD elements are always forced to follow the specified ordering of the document, so unordered elements are not permitted. These draw-backs led to the development of XML schema, a more general but also more com-plex language for specifying the structure and elements of XML documents.\\n13.3.2 XML Schema\\nThe XML schema language  is a standard for specifying the structure of XML docu-\\nments. It uses the same syntax rules as regular XML documents, so that the same pro-cessors can be used on both. To distinguish the two types of documents, we will use the term XML instance document  or XML document  for a regular XML document that con-\\ntains both tag names and data values, and XML schema document  for a document that \\nspecifies an XML schema. An XML schema document would contain only tag names, tree structure information, constraints, and other descriptions but no data values. Fig-ure 13.5 shows an XML schema document corresponding to the \\nCOMPANY  database \\nshown in Figure 5.5. Although it is unlikely that we would want to display the whole database as a single document, there have been proposals to store data in native XML  \\nformat as an alternative to storing the data in relational databases. The schema in Fig-ure 13.5 would serve the purpose of specifying the structure of the \\nCOMPANY  database \\nif it were stored in a native XML system. We discuss this topic further in Section 13.4.\\nAs with XML DTD, XML schema is based on the tree data model, with elements and \\nattributes as the main structuring concepts. However, it borrows additional concepts from database and object models, such as keys, references, and identifiers. Here we describe the features of XML schema in a step-by-step manner, referring to the sam-ple XML schema document in Figure 13.5 for illustration. We introduce and describe some of the schema concepts in the order in which they are used in Figure 13.5.'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 470}, page_content='440 Chapter 13 XML: Extensible Markup Language\\n  1. Schema descriptions and XML namespaces.  It is necessary to identify the \\nspecific set of XML schema language elements (tags) being used by specify-ing a file stored at a Web site location. The second line in Figure 13.5 speci-fies the file used in this example, which is \\nhttp://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema . \\nThis is a commonly used standard for XML schema commands. Each such definition is called an XML namespace  because it defines the set of com-\\nmands (names) that can be used. The file name is assigned to the variable \\nxsd \\n(XML schema description) using the attribute xmlns  (XML namespace), and \\nthis variable is used as a prefix to all XML schema commands (tag names). For example, in Figure 13.5, when we write \\nxsd:element  or xsd:sequence , we \\nare referring to the definitions of the element  and sequence  tags as defined in \\nthe file http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema .\\n  2. Annotations, documentation, and language used.  The next couple of lines \\nin Figure 13.5 illustrate the XML schema elements (tags) xsd:annotation  and \\nxsd:documentation , which are used for providing comments and other \\ndescriptions in the XML document. The attribute xml:lang  of the \\nxsd:documentation  element specifies the language being used, where en stands \\nfor the English language.\\n  3. Elements and types.  Next, we specify the root element  of our XML schema. \\nIn XML schema, the name  attribute of the xsd:element  tag specifies the ele-\\nment name, which is called company  for the root element in our example (see \\nFigure 13.5). The structure of the company  root element can then be speci-\\nfied, which in our example is xsd:complexType . This is further specified to be \\na sequence of departments, employees, and projects using the xsd:sequence  \\nstructure of XML schema. It is important to note here that this is not the \\nonly way to specify an XML schema for the COMPANY  database. We will \\ndiscuss other options in Section 13.6.\\n  4. First-level elements in the COMPANY  database.  Next, we specify the three \\nfirst-level elements under the company  root element in Figure 13.5. These \\nelements are named employee , department , and project , and each is specified \\nin an xsd:element  tag. Notice that if a tag has only attributes and no further \\nsubelements or data within it, it can be ended with the backslash symbol (/>) \\ndirectly instead of having a separate matching end tag. These are called \\nempty elements ; examples are the xsd:element  elements named department  \\nand project  in Figure 13.5.\\n  5. Specifying element type and minimum and maximum occurrences.  In \\nXML schema, the attributes type, minOccurs,  and maxOccurs  in the xsd:element  \\ntag specify the type and multiplicity of each element in any document that \\nconforms to the schema specifications. If we specify a type attribute in an \\nxsd:element , the structure of the element must be described separately, typi-\\ncally using the xsd:complexType  element of XML schema. This is illustrated \\nby the employee , department , and project  elements in Figure 13.5. On the other \\nhand, if no type attribute is specified, the element structure can be defined \\ndirectly following the tag, as illustrated by the company  root element in Fig-\\nure 13.5. The minOccurs  and maxOccurs  tags are used for specifying lower'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 471}, page_content='13.3 XML Documents, DTD, and XML Schema  441\\nand upper bounds on the number of occurrences of an element in any XML \\ndocument that conforms to the schema specifications. If they are not speci-fied, the default is exactly one occurrence. These serve a similar role to the \\n*, \\n+, and ? symbols of XML DTD.\\n  6. Specifying keys.  In XML schema, it is possible to specify constraints that \\ncorrespond to unique and primary key constraints in a relational database (see Section 5.2.2), as well as foreign keys (or referential integrity) con-straints (see Section 5.2.4). The \\nxsd:unique  tag specifies elements that cor-\\nrespond to unique attributes in a relational database. We can give each such uniqueness constraint a name, and we must specify \\nxsd:selector  and \\nxsd:field  tags for it to identify the element type that contains the unique ele-\\nment and the element name within it that is unique via the xpath  attribute. \\nThis is illustrated by the departmentNameUnique  and projectNameUnique  ele-\\nments in Figure 13.5. For specifying primary keys , the tag xsd:key  is used \\ninstead of xsd:unique , as illustrated by the projectNumberKey , department-\\nNumberKey , and employeeSSNKey  elements in Figure 13.5. For specifying \\nforeign keys , the tag xsd:keyref  is used, as illustrated by the six xsd:keyref  \\nelements in Figure 13.5. When specifying a foreign key, the attribute refer \\nof the xsd:keyref  tag specifies the referenced primary key, whereas the tags \\nxsd:selector  and xsd:field  specify the referencing element type and foreign \\nkey (see Figure 13.5).\\n  7. Specifying the structures of complex elements via complex types.  The \\nnext part of our example specifies the structures of the complex elements \\nDepartment , Employee , Project , and Dependent , using the tag xsd:complexType  \\n(see Figure 13.5). We specify each of these as a sequence of subelements cor-responding to the database attributes of each entity type (see Figure 7.7)by using the \\nxsd:sequence  and xsd:element  tags of XML schema. Each element is \\ngiven a name and type via the attributes name  and type of xsd:element . We can \\nalso specify minOccurs  and maxOccurs  attributes if we need to change the \\ndefault of exactly one occurrence. For (optional) database attributes where null is allowed, we need to specify \\nminOccurs = 0 , whereas for multivalued \\ndatabase attributes we need to specify maxOccurs = “unbounded”  on the cor-\\nresponding element. Notice that if we were not going to specify any key con-straints, we could have embedded the subelements within the parent element definitions directly without having to specify complex types. However, when unique, primary key and foreign key constraints need to be specified; we must define complex types to specify the element structures.\\n  8. Composite (compound) attributes.  Composite attributes from Figure 9.2 \\nare also specified as complex types in Figure 13.7, as illustrated by the \\nAddress , Name , Worker , and WorksOn  complex types. These could have been \\ndirectly embedded within their parent elements.\\nThis example illustrates some of the main features of XML schema. There are other \\nfeatures, but they are beyond the scope of our presentation. In the next section, we \\ndiscuss the different approaches to creating XML documents from relational data-bases and storing XML documents.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 472}, page_content='442 Chapter 13 XML: Extensible Markup Language\\n13.4  Storing and Extracting X ML Documents \\nfrom Databases\\nSeveral approaches to organizing the contents of XML documents to facilitate their \\nsubsequent querying and retrieval have been proposed. The following are the most common approaches:\\n  1. Using a file system or a DBMS to store the documents as text.  An XML \\ndocument can be stored as a text file within a traditional file system. Alter-natively, a relational DBMS can be used to store whole XML documents as text fields within the DBMS recordss. This approach can be used if the DBMS has a special module for document processing, and it would work for storing schemaless and document-centric XML documents.\\n  2. Using a DBMS to store the document contents as data elements.  This \\napproach would work for storing a collection of documents that follow a specific XML DTD or XML schema. Because all the documents have the same structure, one can design a relational database to store the leaf-level data elements within the XML documents. This approach would require mapping algorithms to design a database schema that is compatible with the XML document structure as specified in the XML schema or DTD and to re-create the XML documents from the stored data. These algorithms can be implemented either as an internal DBMS module or as separate middleware that is not part of the DBMS. If all elements in an XML document have IDs, a simple representation would be to have a table with attributes XDOC(CId, PId, Etag, Val) where CID and PId are the parent and child element IDs, Etag is the name of the element of the Cid, and Val is the value if it is a leaf node, assuming all values are the same type.\\n  3. Designing a specialized system for storing native XML data.  A new type \\nof database system based on the hierarchical (tree) model could be designed and implemented. Such systems are referred to as native XML DBMS s. The \\nsystem would include specialized indexing and querying techniques and would work for all types of XML documents. It could also include data com-pression techniques to reduce the size of the documents for storage. Tamino by Software AG and the Dynamic Application Platform of eXcelon are two popular products that offer native XML DBMS capability. Oracle also offers a native XML storage option.\\n  4. Creating or publishing customized XML documents from preexisting relational databases.  Because there are enormous amounts of data already \\nstored in relational databases, parts of this data may need to be formatted as documents for exchanging or displaying over the Web. This approach would use a separate middleware software layer to handle the conversions needed between the relational data and the extracted XML documents. Section 13.6 discusses this approach, in which data-centric XML documents are extracted from existing databases, in more detail. In particular, we show how tree structured documents can be created from flat relational databases that have'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 473}, page_content='13.5 XML Languages  443\\nbeen designed using the ER graph-structured data model. Section 13.6.2 \\ndiscusses the problem of cycles and how to deal with it.\\nAll of these approaches have received considerable attention. We focus on the \\nfourth approach in Section 13.6, because it gives a good conceptual understanding of the differences between the XML tree data model and the traditional database models based on flat files (relational model) and graph representations (ER model). But first we give an overview of XML query languages in Section 13.5.\\n13.5 X ML Languages\\nThere have been several proposals for XML query languages, and two query language \\nstandards have emerged. The first is XPath , which provides language constructs for \\nspecifying path expressions to identify certain nodes (elements) or attributes within an XML document that match specific patterns. The second is XQuery , which is a \\nmore general query language. XQuery uses XPath expressions but has additional con-structs. We give an overview of each of these languages in this section. Then we dis-cuss some additional languages related to HTML in Section 13.5.3.\\n13.5.1 XPath: Specifying Path Expressions in XML\\nAn XPath  expression generally returns a sequence of items that satisfy a certain pat-\\ntern as specified by the expression. These items are either values (from leaf nodes) \\nor elements or attributes. The most common type of XPath  expression returns a col-\\nlection of element or attribute nodes that satisfy certain patterns specified in the \\nexpression. The names in the XPath  expression are node names in the XML docu-\\nment tree that are either tag (element) names or attribute names, possibly with \\nadditional qualifier conditions  to further restrict the nodes that satisfy the pattern. \\nTwo main separators  are used when specifying a path: single slash (/) and double \\nslash (//). A single slash before a tag specifies that the tag must appear as a direct child of the previous (parent) tag, whereas a double slash specifies that the tag can appear as a descendant of the previous tag at any level . To refer to an attribute name \\ninstead of an element (tag) name, the prefix @ is used before the attribute name. Let \\nus look at some examples of XPath as shown in Figure 13.6.\\nThe first XPath expression in Figure 13.6 returns the \\ncompany  root node and all its \\ndescendant nodes, which means that it returns the whole XML document. We should note that it is customary to include the file name in the \\nXPath  query. This \\nallows us to specify any local file name or even any path name that specifies a file on \\nthe Web. For example, if the COMPANY  XML document is stored at the location\\nwww.company.com/info.XML\\nthen the first XPath expression in Figure 13.6 can be written as\\ndoc(www.company.com/info.XML )/company\\nThis prefix would also be included in the other examples of XPath  expressions.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 474}, page_content='444 Chapter 13 XML: Extensible Markup Language\\nThe second example in Figure 13.6 returns all department nodes (elements) and \\ntheir descendant subtrees. Note that the nodes (elements) in an XML document are \\nordered, so the XPath  result that returns multiple nodes will do so in the same order \\nin which the nodes are ordered in the document tree.\\nThe third XPath  expression in Figure 13.6 illustrates the use of //, which is conve-\\nnient to use if we do not know the full path name we are searching for, but we do \\nknow the name of some tags of interest within the XML document. This is particu-\\nlarly useful for schemaless XML documents or for documents with many nested levels of nodes.\\n6\\nThe expression returns all employeeName  nodes that are direct children of an \\nemployee  node, such that the employee  node has another child element employeeSalary  \\nwhose value is greater than 70000 . This illustrates the use of qualifier conditions, \\nwhich restrict the nodes selected by the XPath  expression to those that satisfy the \\ncondition. XPath  has a number of comparison operations for use in qualifier condi-\\ntions, including standard arithmetic, string, and set comparison operations.\\nThe fourth XPath  expression in Figure 13.6 should return the same result as the pre-\\nvious one, except that we specified the full path name in this example. The fifth expression in Figure 13.6 returns all \\nprojectWorker  nodes and their descendant \\nnodes that are children under a path /company/project  and have a child node, hours,  \\nwith a value greater than 20.0 hours.\\nWhen we need to include attributes in an XPath  expression, the attribute name is \\nprefixed by the @ symbol to distinguish it from element (tag) names. It is also pos-\\nsible to use the wildcard  symbol *, which stands for any element, as in the following \\nexample, which retrieves all elements that are child elements of the root, regardless of their element type. When wildcards are used, the result can be a sequence of dif-ferent types of elements.\\n/company/*\\nThe examples above illustrate simple XPath  expressions, where we can only move \\ndown in the tree structure from a given node. A more general model for path expressions has been proposed. In this model, it is possible to move in multiple directions from the current node in the path expression. These are known as the 1. /company\\n2. /company/department\\n3. //employee [employeeSalary gt 70000]/employeeName\\n4. /company/employee [employeeSalary gt 70000]/employeeName\\n5. /company/project/projectWorker [hours ge 20.0]Figure 13.6 \\nSome examples of XPath expressions on XML documents that follow the XML schema file company  \\nin Figure 13.5.\\n6We use the terms node , tag, and element  interchangeably here.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 475}, page_content='13.5 XML Languages  445\\naxes  of an XPath  expression. Our examples above used only three of these axes : child \\nof the current node (/), descendent or self at any level of the current node (//), and attribute of the current node (@). Other axes include parent, ancestor (at any level), previous sibling (a node at same level to the left), and next sibling (a node at the same level to the right). These axes allow for more complex path expressions.\\nThe main restriction of \\nXPath  path expressions is that the path that specifies the pat-\\ntern also specifies the items to be retrieved. Hence, it is difficult to specify certain conditions on the pattern while separately specifying which result items should be retrieved. The \\nXQuery  language separates these two concerns and provides more \\npowerful constructs for specifying queries.\\n13.5.2 XQuery: Specifying Queries in XML\\nXPath  allows us to write expressions that select items from a tree-structured XML \\ndocument. XQuery  permits the specification of more general queries on one or \\nmore XML documents. The typical form of a query in XQuery  is known as a \\nFLWOR expression , which stands for the five main clauses of XQuery  and has the \\nfollowing form:\\nFOR <variable bindings to individual nodes (elements)>\\nLET <variable bindings to collections of nodes (elements)>WHERE <qualifier conditions>ORDER BY <ordering specifications>RETURN <query result specification>\\nThere can be zero or more instances of the FOR  clause, as well as of the LET clause \\nin a single XQuery . The WHERE  and ORDER BY clauses are optional but can appear \\nat most once, and the RETURN  clause must appear exactly once. Let us illustrate \\nthese clauses with the following simple example of an XQuery .\\nLET $d : = doc(www.company.com/info.xml)\\nFOR  $x IN $d/company/project[projectNumber = 5]/projectWorker, \\n$y IN $d/company/employee\\nWHERE $x/hours gt 20.0 AND $y.ssn = $x.ssnORDER BY $x/hoursRETURN <res>  $y/employeeName/firstName, $y/employeeName/lastName,  \\n$x/hours </res>\\n  1. Variables are prefixed with the $ sign. In the above example, $d, $x, and $y \\nare variables. The LET clause assigns a variable to a particular expression for \\nthe rest of the query. In this example, $d is assigned to the document file \\nname. It is possible to have a query that refers to multiple documents by \\nassigning multiple variables in this way.\\n  2. The FOR  clause assigns a variable to range over each of the individual ele-\\nments in a sequence. In our example, the sequences are specified by path \\nexpressions. The $x variable ranges over elements that satisfy the path expres-\\nsion $d/company/project[projectNumber = 5]/projectWorker.  The $y variable'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 476}, page_content='446 Chapter 13 XML: Extensible Markup Language\\nranges over elements that satisfy the path expression $d/company/employee . \\nHence, $x ranges over projectWorker  elements for workers who work in proj-\\nect\\xa05, whereas $y ranges over employee  elements.\\n  3. The WHERE  clause specifies additional conditions on the selection of items. \\nIn this example, the first condition selects only those projectWorker  elements \\nthat satisfy the condition (hours gt 20.0) . The second condition specifies a \\njoin condition that combines an employee  with a projectWorker  only if they \\nhave the same ssn value.\\n  4. The ORDER BY  clause specifies that the result elements will be ordered by the \\nvalue of the hours per week they work on the project in ascending value of hours.\\n  5. Finally, the RETURN  clause specifies which elements or attributes should be \\nretrieved from the items that satisfy the query conditions. In this example, it will return a sequence of elements each containing \\n<firstName, lastName, hours>  \\nfor employees who work more that 20 hours per week on project number 5.\\nFigure 13.7 includes some additional examples of queries in XQuery  that can be \\nspecified on an XML instance documents that follow the XML schema document \\nin Figure 13.5. The first query retrieves the first and last names of employees who \\nearn more than $70,000. The variable $x is bound to each employeeName  element \\nthat is a child of an employee  element, but only for employee  elements that satisfy \\nthe qualifier that their employeeSalary  value is greater than $70,000. The result \\nretrieves the firstName  and lastName  child elements of the selected employeeName  \\nelements. The second query is an alternative way of retrieving the same elements \\nretrieved by the first query.\\nThe third query illustrates how a join operation can be performed by using more \\nthan one variable. Here, the $x variable is bound to each projectWorker  element that \\nis a child of project number 5, whereas the $y variable is bound to each employee  \\nelement. The join condition matches ssn values in order to retrieve the employee \\nnames. Notice that this is an alternative way of specifying the same query in our \\nearlier example, but without the LET clause .\\nXQuery  has very powerful constructs to specify complex queries. In particular, it can \\nspecify universal and existential quantifiers in the conditions of a query, aggregate \\nfunctions, ordering of query results, selection based on position in a sequence, and \\neven conditional branching. Hence, in some ways, it qualifies as a full-fledged pro-\\ngramming language.\\nThis concludes our brief introduction to XQuery .

As we have discussed, XML uses a hierarchical (tree) model to represent documents. The database systems with the most widespread use follow the flat relational data model. When we add referential 1.

Similarly, the ER model represents data using graph-like structures (for example, see Figure 7.2). We saw in Chapter 9 that there are straightforward mappings between the ER and relational models, so we can con-ceptually represent a relational database schema using the corresponding ER schema. Although we will use the ER model in our discussion and examples to clar-ify the conceptual differences between tree and graph models, the same issues apply to converting relational data to XML.\\nWe will use the simplified \\nUNIVERSITY  ER schema shown in Figure 13.8 to illus-\\ntrate our discussion. Suppose that an application needs to extract XML docu-ments for student, course, and grade information from the \\nUNIVERSITY  database. \\nThe data needed for these documents is contained in the database attributes of the entity types \\nCOURSE , SECTION , and STUDENT  from Figure 13.8, and the \\nrelationships S-S and C-S between them.

In this example, the subset of the database that is needed is shown in Figure 13.9.\\nAt least three possible document hierarchies can be extracted from the database \\nsubset in Figure 13.9.

If a student has taken multiple sections, that student’s information will appear multiple times in the document—once under each section. A possible simplified XML schema for this view is shown in Figure 13.11. The Grade database attribute in the \\nS-S relationship is migrated to \\nthe STUDENT  element.

It is possible to have a more complex subset with one or more cycles, indicating multi-ple relationships among the entities. In this case, it is more difficult to decide how \\nto create the document hierarchies. Additional duplication of entities may be needed to represent the multiple relationships. We will illustrate this with an exam-ple using the ER schema in Figure 13.8.\\nSuppose that we need the information in all the entity types and relationships in \\nFigure 13.8 for a particular XML document, with \\nSTUDENT  as the root element. \\nFigure 13.15 illustrates how a possible hierarchical tree structure can be created for this document. First, we get a lattice with \\nSTUDENT  as the root, as shown in Fig- \\nure 13.15(a). This is not a tree structure because of the cycles. One way to break the cycles is to replicate the entity types involved in the cycles. First, we replicate \\nINSTRUCTOR  as shown in Figure 13.15(b), calling the replica to the right  \\nINSTRUCTOR1 . The INSTRUCTOR  replica on the left represents the relationship \\nbetween instructors and the sections they teach, whereas the INSTRUCTOR1  replica \\non the right represents the relationship between instructors and the department each works in. After this, we still have the cycle involving \\nCOURSE , so we can repli-\\ncate COURSE  in a similar manner, leading to the hierarchy shown in Fig- \\nure 13.15(c). The COURSE1  replica to the left represents the relationship between \\ncourses and their sections, whereas the COURSE  replica to the right represents the \\nrelationship between courses and the department that offers each course.\\nIn Figure 13.15(c), we have converted the initial graph to a hierarchy. We can do \\nfurther merging if desired (as in our previous example) before creating the final hierarchy and the corresponding XML schema structure.1\\nSsnStudents\\nattended\\nName\\nSTUDENT1Number\\nQtrYear\\nSECTION\\n1N\\nGradeClass\\nCOURSECourse_number\\nCourse_name Figure 13.14 \\nHierarchical (tree) view with SECTION as the root.'),\n",

XMLELEMENT: This is used to specify a tag (element) name that will \\nappear in the XML result. It can specify a tag name for a complex element or for an individual column.\\n  2. XMLFOREST: If several tags (elements) are needed in the XML result, this function can create multiple element names in a simpler manner than XMLELEMENT. The column names can be listed directly, separated by commas, with or without renaming. If a column name is not renamed, it will be used as the element (tag) name.\\n  3. XMLAGG: This can group together (or aggregate) several elements so they can be placed under a parent element as a collection of subelements.\\n  4. XMLROOT: This allows the selected elements to be formatted as an XML document with a single root element.\\n  5. XMLATTRIBUTES: This allows the creation of attributes for the elements of the XML result.\\nWe now illustrate these functions with a few SQL/XML examples that refer to the \\nEMPLOYEE table from Figures 5.5 and 5.6.

First we discussed some of the differences between various types of data, classifying three main types: structured, semistructured, and unstructured. Structured data is stored in traditional databases. Semistructured data mixes data types names and data values, but the data does not all have to follow a fixed predefined structure. Unstructured data refers to information displayed on the Web, specified via HTML, where information on the types of data items is missing. We described the XML standard and its tree-structured (hierarchical) data model, and we discussed XML documents and the languages for specifying the structure of these documents, namely, XML DTD (Document Type Definition) and XML schema. We gave an overview of the various approaches for storing XML docu-ments, whether in their native (text) format, in a compressed form, or in relational and other types of databases. We gave an overview of the XPath and XQuery lan-guages proposed for querying XML data, and we discussed the mapping issues that arise when it is necessary to convert data stored in traditional relational databases into XML documents. Finally, we discussed SQL/XML, which provides SQL with additional functionality to format SQL query results as XML data.'),\n",

Each relation schema  consists of a number of attributes, and the relational \\ndatabase schema  consists of a number of relation schemas. So far, we have assumed \\nthat attributes are grouped to form a relation schema by using the common sense of the database designer or by mapping a database schema design from a conceptual data model such as the ER or enhanced-ER (EER) data model. These models make the designer identify entity types and relationship types and their respective attri-butes, which leads to a natural and logical grouping of the attributes into relations when the mapping procedures discussed in Chapter 9 are followed. However, we still need some formal way of analyzing why one grouping of attributes into a rela-tion schema may be better than another. While discussing database design in  Chapters 3, 4, and 9, we did not develop any measure of appropriateness or  goodness  \\nto measure the quality of the design, other than the intuition of the designer. In this chapter we discuss some of the theory that has been developed with the goal of evaluating relational schemas for design quality—that is, to measure formally why one set of groupings of attributes into relation schemas is better than another.\\nThere are two levels at which we can discuss the goodness  of relation schemas. The \\nfirst is the logical  (or conceptual ) level —how users interpret the relation schemas \\nand the meaning of their attributes. Having good relation schemas at this level enables users to understand clearly the meaning of the data in the relations, and hence to formulate their queries correctly. The second is the implementation  (or \\nphysical storage ) level —how the tuples in a base relation are stored and updated. chapter 14'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 490}, page_content='460 Chapter 14 Basics of Functional Dependencies and Normalization for Relational Databases\\nThis level applies only to schemas of base relations—which will be physically stored \\nas files—whereas at the logical level we are interested in schemas of both base rela-tions and views (virtual relations). The relational database design theory developed in this chapter applies mainly to base relations,  although some criteria of appropri-\\nateness also apply to views, as shown in Section 14.1.\\nAs with many design problems, database design may be performed using two \\napproaches: bottom-up or top-down. A bottom-up design methodology  (also called \\ndesign by synthesis ) considers the basic relationships among individual attributes  as \\nthe starting point and uses those to construct relation schemas. This approach is not very popular in practice\\n1 because it suffers from the problem of having to collect a \\nlarge number of binary relationships among attributes as the starting point. For prac-tical situations, it is next to impossible to capture binary relationships among all such pairs of attributes. In contrast, a top-down design methodology  (also called design by \\nanalysis ) starts with a number of groupings of attributes into relations that exist \\ntogether naturally, for example, on an invoice, a form, or a report. The relations are then analyzed individually and collectively, leading to further decomposition until all desirable properties are met. The theory described in this chapter is applicable pri-marily to the top-down design approach, and as such is more appropriate when per-forming design of databases by analysis and decomposition of sets of attributes that appear together in files, in reports, and on forms in real-life situations.\\nRelational database design ultimately produces a set of relations. The implicit goals \\nof the design activity are information preservation  and minimum redundancy . \\nInformation is very hard to quantify—hence we consider information preservation in terms of maintaining all concepts, including attribute types, entity types, and relationship types as well as generalization/specialization relationships, which are described using a model such as the EER model. Thus, the relational design must preserve all of these concepts, which are originally captured in the conceptual design after the conceptual to logical design mapping. Minimizing redundancy implies minimizing redundant storage of the same information and reducing the need for multiple updates to maintain consistency across multiple copies of the same information in response to real-world events that require making an update.\\nWe start this chapter by informally discussing some criteria for good and bad rela-\\ntion schemas in Section 14.1. In Section 14.2, we define the concept of functional \\ndependency,  a formal constraint among attributes that is the main tool for formally \\nmeasuring the appropriateness of attribute groupings into relation schemas. In Sec-tion 14.3, we discuss normal forms and the process of normalization using func-tional dependencies. Successive normal forms are defined to meet a set of desirable constraints expressed using primary keys and functional dependencies. The normal-ization procedure consists of applying a series of tests to relations to meet these increasingly stringent requirements and decompose the relations when necessary. In Section 14.4, we discuss more general definitions of normal forms that can be directly \\n1An exception in which this approach is used in practice is based on a model called the binary relational \\nmodel . An example is the NIAM methodology (Verheijen and VanBekkum, 1982).'),\n",

Sections 14.5 to 14.7 discuss further normal forms up to the fifth normal form. In Section 14.6 we introduce the multivalued dependency (MVD), followed by the join dependency (JD) in Section 14.7. Section 14.8 summarizes the chapter.\\nChapter 15 continues the development of the theory related to the design of good \\nrelational schemas. We discuss desirable properties of relational decomposition—\\nnonadditive join property and functional dependency preservation property. A \\ngeneral algorithm that tests whether or not a decomposition has the nonadditive (or lossless ) join property (Algorithm 15.3 is also presented). We then discuss prop-\\nerties of functional dependencies and the concept of a minimal cover of dependen-cies. We consider the bottom-up approach to database design consisting of a set of algorithms to design relations in a desired normal form. These algorithms assume as input a given set of functional dependencies and achieve a relational design in a target normal form while adhering to the above desirable properties. In Chapter 15 we also define additional types of dependencies that further enhance the evaluation of the goodness  of relation schemas.\\nIf Chapter 15 is not covered in a course, we recommend a quick introduction to the \\ndesirable properties of decomposition from Section 15.2. and the importance of the non-additive join property during decomposition.\\n14.1  Informal Design Guidelines  \\nfor Relation Schemas\\nBefore discussing the formal theory of relational database design, we discuss four \\ninformal guidelines  that may be used as measures to determine the quality  of relation \\nschema design:\\n ■Making sure that the semantics of the attributes is clear in the schema\\n ■Reducing the redundant information in tuples\\n ■Reducing the NULL  values in tuples\\n ■Disallowing the possibility of generating spurious tuples\\nThese measures are not always independent of one another, as we will see.\\n14.1.1 Imparting Clear Semantics to Attributes in Relations\\nWhenever we group attributes to form a relation schema, we assume that attri-\\nbutes belonging to one relation have certain real-world meaning and a proper interpretation associated with them. The semantics  of a relation refers to its mean-\\ning resulting from the interpretation of attribute values in a tuple. In Chapter 5 we discussed how a relation can be interpreted as a set of facts. If the conceptual design described in Chapters 3 and 4 is done carefully and the mapping procedure in Chapter 9 is followed systematically, the relational schema design should have a clear meaning.'),\n",

The semantics of the DEPARTMENT  and PROJECT  \\nschemas are also straightforward: Each DEPARTMENT  tuple represents a department \\nentity, and each PROJECT  tuple represents a project entity.

Each tuple in DEPT_LOCATIONS  gives a department number ( Dnumber ) \\nand one of  the locations of the department ( Dlocation ). Each tuple in WORKS_ON  \\ngives an employee Social Security number ( Ssn), the project number of one of  the \\nprojects that the employee works on ( Pnumber ), and the number of hours per week \\nthat the employee works on that project ( Hours ). However, both schemas have a \\nwell-defined and unambiguous interpretation. The schema DEPT_LOCATIONS  rep-\\nresents a multivalued attribute of DEPARTMENT , whereas WORKS_ON  represents \\nan M:N relationship between EMPLOYEE  and PROJECT . Hence, all the relation \\nschemas in Figure 14.1 may be considered as easy to explain and therefore good from the standpoint of having clear semantics. We can thus formulate the following informal design guideline.\\nGuideline 1. Design a relation schema so that it is easy to explain its meaning. Do \\nnot combine attributes from multiple entity types and relationship types into a sin-gle relation. Intuitively, if a relation schema corresponds to one entity type or one relationship type, it is straightforward to explain its meaning. Otherwise, if the rela-tion corresponds to a mixture of multiple entities and relationships, semantic ambi-guities will result and the relation cannot be easily explained.\\nExamples of Violating Guideline 1. The relation schemas in Figures 14.3(a)  \\nand 14.3(b) also have clear semantics. (The reader should ignore the lines under the relations for now; they are used to illustrate functional dependency notation, dis-cussed in Section 14.2.) A tuple in the \\nEMP_DEPT  relation schema in Figure 14.3(a) \\nrepresents a single employee but includes, along with the Dnumber (the identifier \\nfor the department he/she works for), additional information—namely, the  \\nname ( Dname ) of the department for which the employee works and the Social \\nSecurity number ( Dmgr_ssn ) of the department manager. For the EMP_PROJ  rela-\\ntion in Figure 14.3(b), each tuple relates an employee to a project but also includes \\nSsnEMP_PROJ(b)(a)\\nFD1\\nFD2FD3Pnumber Hours Ename Pname PlocationEname SsnEMP_DEPT\\nBdate Address Dnumber Dname Dmgr_ssnFigure 14.3 \\nTwo relation schemas suffering from update anomalies.

Hence, they fare poorly \\nagainst the above measure of design quality. They may be used as views, but they cause problems when used as base relations, as we discuss in the following section.\\n14.1.2 Redundant Information in Tuples and Update Anomalies\\nOne goal of schema design is to minimize the storage space used by the base rela-tions (and hence the corresponding files). Grouping attributes into relation sche-mas has a significant effect on storage space. For example, compare the space used by the two base relations \\nEMPLOYEE  and DEPARTMENT  in Figure 14.2 with that \\nfor an EMP_DEPT  base relation in Figure 14.4, which is the result of applying the \\nNATURAL JOIN  operation to EMPLOYEE  and DEPARTMENT . In EMP_DEPT , the attri-\\nbute values pertaining to a particular department ( Dnumber , Dname , Dmgr_ssn ) are \\nrepeated for every employee who works for that department.  In contrast, each depart-\\nment’s information appears only once in the DEPARTMENT  relation in Figure 14.2. \\nOnly the department number ( Dnumber ) is repeated in the EMPLOYEE  relation for \\neach employee who works in that department as a foreign key. Similar comments apply to the \\nEMP_PROJ  relation (see Figure 14.4), which augments the WORKS_ON  \\nrelation with additional attributes from EMPLOYEE  and PROJECT .\\nStoring natural joins of base relations leads to an additional problem referred to as \\nupdate anomalies . These can be classified into insertion anomalies, deletion anom-\\nalies, and modification anomalies.2\\nInsertion Anomalies. Insertion anomalies can be differentiated into two types, \\nillustrated by the following examples based on the EMP_DEPT  relation:\\n ■To insert a new employee tuple into EMP_DEPT , we must include either the \\nattribute values for the department that the employee works for, or NULL s (if \\nthe employee does not work for a department as yet). For example, to insert a new tuple for an employee who works in department number 5, we must enter all the attribute values of department 5 correctly so that they are con-\\nsistent  with the corresponding values for department 5 in other tuples in \\nEMP_DEPT . In the design of Figure 14.2, we do not have to worry about this \\nconsistency problem because we enter only the department number in the employee tuple; all other attribute values of department 5 are recorded only once in the database, as a single tuple in the \\nDEPARTMENT  relation.\\n ■It is difficult to insert a new department that has no employees as yet in the \\nEMP_DEPT  relation. The only way to do this is to place NULL  values in the \\n2These anomalies were identified by Codd (1972a) to justify the need for normalization of relations, as \\nwe shall discuss in Section 15.3.'),\n",

This violates the entity integrity for EMP_DEPT  \\nbecause its primary key Ssn cannot be null. Moreover, when the first \\nemployee is assigned to that department, we do not need this tuple with \\nNULL  values anymore.

The problem of deletion anomalies is related to the second \\ninsertion anomaly situation just discussed. If we delete from EMP_DEPT  an employee \\ntuple that happens to represent the last employee working for a particular depart-ment, the information concerning that department is lost inadvertently from the database. This problem does not occur in the database of Figure 14.2 because \\nDEPARTMENT  tuples are stored separately.\\nModification Anomalies. In EMP_DEPT , if we change the value of one of the attri-\\nbutes of a particular department—say, the manager of department 5—we must update the tuples of all employees who work in that department; otherwise, the \\ndatabase will become inconsistent. If we fail to update some tuples, the same depart-ment will be shown to have two different values for manager in different employee tuples, which would be wrong.\\n3\\nIt is easy to see that these three anomalies are undesirable and cause difficulties to maintain consistency of data as well as require unnecessary updates that can be avoided; hence, we can state the next guideline as follows.\\nGuideline 2. Design the base relation schemas so that no insertion, deletion, or \\nmodification anomalies are present in the relations. If any anomalies are present,\\n4 \\nnote them clearly and make sure that the programs that update the database will operate correctly.\\nThe second guideline is consistent with and, in a way, a restatement of the first \\nguideline. We can also see the need for a more formal approach to evaluating whether a design meets these guidelines. Sections 14.2 through 14.4 provide these needed formal concepts. It is important to note that these guidelines may some-times have to be violated  in order to improve the performance  of certain queries. If \\nEMP_DEPT  is used as a stored relation (known otherwise as a materialized view ) in \\naddition to the base relations of EMPLOYEE  and DEPARTMENT , the anomalies in \\nEMP_DEPT  must be noted and accounted for (for example, by using triggers or \\nstored procedures that would make automatic updates). This way, whenever the base relation is updated, we do not end up with inconsistencies. In general, it is advisable to use anomaly-free base relations and to specify views that include the joins for placing together the attributes frequently referenced in important queries.\\n14.1.3 NULL Values in Tuples\\nIn some schema designs we may group many attributes together into a “fat” rela-tion. If many of the attributes do not apply to all tuples in the relation, we end up with many \\nNULL s in those tuples. This can waste space at the storage level and may \\nalso lead to problems with understanding the meaning of the attributes and with \\n3This is not as serious as the other problems, because all tuples can be updated by a single SQL query.\\n4Other application considerations may dictate and make certain anomalies unavoidable. For example, the \\nEMP_DEPT relation may correspond to a query or a report that is frequently required.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 498}, page_content='468 Chapter 14 Basics of Functional Dependencies and Normalization for Relational Databases\\nspecifying JOIN  operations at the logical level.5 Another problem with NULL s is how \\nto account for them when aggregate operations such as COUNT  or SUM  are applied. \\nSELECT  and JOIN  operations involve comparisons; if NULL  values are present, the \\nresults may become unpredictable.6 Moreover, NULL s can have multiple interpreta-\\ntions, such as the following:\\n ■The attribute does not apply  to this tuple. For example, Visa_status  may not \\napply to U.S. students.\\n ■The attribute value for this tuple is unknown . For example, the Date_of_birth  \\nmay be unknown for an employee.\\n ■The value is known but absent ; that is, it has not been recorded yet. For \\nexample, the Home_Phone_Number  for an employee may exist, but may not \\nbe available and recorded yet.\\nHaving the same representation for all NULL s compromises the different meanings \\nthey may have. Therefore, we state another guideline.\\nGuideline 3. As far as possible, avoid placing attributes in a base relation whose \\nvalues may frequently be NULL . If NULL s are unavoidable, make sure that they apply \\nin exceptional cases only and do not apply to a majority of tuples in the relation.\\nUsing space efficiently and avoiding joins with NULL  values are the two overriding \\ncriteria that determine whether to include the columns that may have NULL s in a \\nrelation or to have a separate relation for those columns (with the appropriate key \\ncolumns). For example, if only 15% of employees have individual offices, there is \\nlittle justification for including an attribute Office_number  in the EMPLOYEE  rela-\\ntion; rather, a relation EMP_OFFICES(Essn , Office_number)  can be created to include \\ntuples for only the employees with individual offices.\\n14.1.4 Generation of Spurious Tuples\\nConsider the two relation schemas EMP_LOCS  and EMP_PROJ1  in Figure 14.5(a), \\nwhich can be used instead of the single EMP_PROJ  relation in Figure 14.3(b). A \\ntuple in EMP_LOCS  means that the employee whose name is Ename  works on at \\nleast one  project located at Plocation . A tuple in EMP_PROJ1  refers to the fact that the \\nemployee whose Social Security number is Ssn works the given Hours  per week on \\nthe project whose name, number, and location are Pname , Pnumber , and Plocation . \\nFigure 14.5(b) shows relation states of EMP_LOCS  and EMP_PROJ1  corresponding \\nto the EMP_PROJ  relation in Figure 14.4, which are obtained by applying the appro-\\npriate PROJECT  (π) operations to EMP_PROJ .\\n5This is because inner and outer joins produce different results when NULLs are involved in joins. The users \\nmust thus be aware of the different meanings of the various types of joins. Although this is reasonable for sophisticated users, it may be difficult for others.\\n6In Section 5.5.1 we presented comparisons involving NULL values where the outcome (in three-valued \\nlogic) is TRUE, FALSE, and UNKNOWN.'),\n",

The problems we pointed out, which can be detected without addi-tional tools of analysis, are as follows:\\n ■Anomalies that cause redundant work to be done during insertion into and \\nmodification of a relation, and that may cause accidental loss of information during a deletion from a relation\\n ■Waste of storage space due to NULL s and the difficulty of performing selec-\\ntions, aggregation operations, and joins due to NULL  values\\n ■Generation of invalid and spurious data during joins on base relations with \\nmatched attributes that may not represent a proper (foreign key, primary \\nkey) relationship\\nIn the rest of this chapter we present formal concepts and theory that may be used \\nto define the goodness  and badness  of individual  relation schemas more precisely. \\nFirst we discuss functional dependency as a tool for analysis. Then we specify the \\nthree normal forms and Boyce-Codd normal form (BCNF) for relation schemas as \\nthe established and accepted standards of quality in relational design. The strategy for achieving a good design is to decompose a badly designed relation appropriately to achieve higher normal forms. We also briefly introduce additional normal forms \\nthat deal with additional dependencies. In Chapter 15, we discuss the properties of \\ndecomposition in detail and provide a variety of algorithms related to functional \\ndependencies, goodness of decomposition, and the bottom-up design of relations by using the functional dependencies as a starting point.\\n14.2 Functional Dependencies\\nSo far we have dealt with the informal measures of database design. We now intro-duce a formal tool for analysis of relational schemas that enables us to detect and describe some of the above-mentioned problems in precise terms. The single most important concept in relational schema design theory is that of a functional depen-\\ndency. In this section we formally define the concept, and in Section 14.3 we see how it can be used to define normal forms for relation schemas.\\n14.2.1 Definition of Functional Dependency\\nA functional dependency is a constraint between two sets of attributes from the \\ndatabase. Suppose that our relational database schema has n attributes A1, A2, \\n… , An; let us think of the whole database as being described by a single universal'),\n",

A functional dependency , denoted by X → Y, between two sets of \\nattributes X and Y that are subsets of R specifies a constraint  on the possible \\ntuples that can form a relation state r of R. The constraint is that, for any two \\ntuples t1 and t2 in r that have t1[X] = t2[X], they must also have t1[Y] = t2[Y].\\nThis means that the values of the Y component of a tuple in r depend on, or are deter-\\nmined by,  the values of the X component; alternatively, the values of the X component \\nof a tuple uniquely (or functionally ) determine  the values of the Y component. We \\nalso say that there is a functional dependency from X to Y, or that Y is functionally \\ndependent  on X. The abbreviation for functional dependency is FD or f.d. The set of \\nattributes X is called the left-hand side  of the FD, and Y is called the right-hand side .\\nThus, X functionally determines Y in a relation schema R if, and only if, whenever \\ntwo tuples of r(R) agree on their X-value, they must necessarily agree on their \\nY-value. Note the following:\\n ■If a constraint on R states that there cannot be more than one tuple with a \\ngiven X-value in any relation instance r(R)—that is, X is a candidate key  of \\nR—this implies that X → Y for any subset of attributes Y of R (because the \\nkey constraint implies that no two tuples in any legal state r(R) will have the \\nsame value of X). If X is a candidate key of R, then X → R.\\n ■If X → Y in R, this does not say whether or not Y → X in R.\\nA functional dependency is a property of the semantics  or meaning of the  \\nattributes . The database designers will use their understanding of the semantics of the \\nattributes of R—that is, how they relate to one another—to specify the functional \\ndependencies that should hold on all relation states (extensions) r of R. Relation \\nextensions r(R) that satisfy the functional dependency constraints are called legal \\nrelation states  (or legal extensions ) of R. Hence, the main use of functional depen-\\ndencies is to describe further a relation schema R by specifying constraints on its \\nattributes that must hold at all times.  Certain FDs can be specified without referring \\nto a specific relation, but as a property of those attributes given their commonly \\nunderstood meaning. For example, { State , Driver_license_number } → Ssn should \\nnormally hold for any adult in the United States and hence should hold whenever these attributes appear in a relation.\\n9 It is also possible that certain functional \\n7This concept of a universal relation is important when we discuss the algorithms for relational database \\ndesign in Chapter 15.\\n8This assumption implies that every attribute in the database should have a distinct name. In Chapter 5 \\nwe prefixed attribute names by relation names to achieve uniqueness whenever attributes in distinct  relations had the same name.\\n9Note that there are databases, such as those of credit card agencies or police departments, where this \\nfunctional dependency may not hold because of fraudulent records resulting from the same driver’s license number being used by two or more different individuals.'),\n",

For \\nexample, the FD Zip_code  → Area_code  used to exist as a relationship between postal \\ncodes and telephone number codes in the United States, but with the proliferation of telephone area codes it is no longer true.\\nConsider the relation schema \\nEMP_PROJ  in Figure 14.3(b); from the semantics of \\nthe attributes and the relation, we know that the following functional dependencies should hold:\\n \\na. Ssn → Ename\\n b. Pnumber  → {Pname , Plocation }\\n c. {Ssn, Pnumber } → Hours\\nThese functional dependencies specify that (a) the value of an employee’s Social \\nSecurity number ( Ssn) uniquely determines the employee name ( Ename ), (b) the \\nvalue of a project’s number ( Pnumber ) uniquely determines the project name \\n(Pname ) and location ( Plocation ), and (c) a combination of Ssn and Pnumber  values \\nuniquely determines the number of hours the employee currently works on the \\nproject per week ( Hours ). Alternatively, we say that Ename  is functionally deter-\\nmined by (or functionally dependent on) Ssn, or given a value of Ssn, we know the \\nvalue of Ename,  and so on.\\nA functional dependency is a property of the relation schema R , not of a particular \\nlegal relation state r of R. Therefore, an FD cannot  be inferred automatically from a \\ngiven relation extension r but must be defined explicitly by someone who knows \\nthe semantics of the attributes of R. For example, Figure 14.7 shows a particular \\nstate  of the TEACH  relation schema. Although at first glance we may think that  \\nText → Course , we cannot confirm this unless we know that it is true for all possible \\nlegal states  of TEACH . It is, however, sufficient to demonstrate a single counterexam-\\nple to disprove a functional dependency. For example, because ‘Smith’ teaches both \\n‘Data Structures’ and ‘Database Systems,’ we can conclude that Teacher  does not  \\nfunctionally determine Course .\\nGiven a populated relation, we cannot determine which FDs hold and which do not \\nunless we know the meaning of and the relationships among the attributes. All we can say is that a certain FD may exist if it holds in that particular extension. We cannot \\nguarantee its existence until we understand the meaning of the corresponding attri-\\nbutes.

See the illustrative example relation in \\nFigure 14.8. Here, the following FDs may hold  because the four tuples in the current \\nextension have no violation of these constraints: B → C; C → B; {A, B} → C; {A, B} → D; \\nand { C, D } → B. However, the following do not  hold because we already have viola-\\ntions of them in the given extension : A → B (tuples 1 and 2 violate this constraint);  \\nB → A (tuples 2 and 3 violate this constraint); D → C (tuples 3 and 4 violate it).\\nFigure 14.3 introduces a diagrammatic notation  for displaying FDs: Each FD is \\ndisplayed as a horizontal line. The left-hand-side attributes of the FD are connected by vertical lines to the line representing the FD, whereas the right-hand-side attri-butes are connected by the lines with arrows pointing toward the attributes.\\nWe denote by F the set of functional dependencies that are specified on relation \\nschema R. Typically, the schema designer specifies the functional dependencies that \\nare semantically obvious ; usually, however, numerous other functional dependen-\\ncies hold in all legal relation instances among sets of attributes that can be derived \\nfrom and satisfy the dependencies in F. Those other dependencies can be inferred  \\nor deduced  from the FDs in F. We defer the details of inference rules and properties \\nof functional dependencies to Chapter 15.\\n14.3 Normal Forms Based on Primary Keys\\nHaving introduced functional dependencies, we are now ready to use them to spec-\\nify how to use them to develop a formal methodology for testing and improving \\nrelation schemas. We assume that a set of functional dependencies is given for each relation, and that each relation has a designated primary key; this information com-bined with the tests (conditions) for normal forms drives the normalization process  \\nfor relational schema design. Most practical relational design projects take one of the following two approaches:\\n ■Perform a conceptual schema design using a conceptual model such as ER \\nor EER and map the conceptual design into a set of relations.\\n ■Design the relations based on external knowledge derived from an existing \\nimplementation of files or forms or reports.\\nFollowing either of these approaches, it is then useful to evaluate the relations for \\ngoodness and decompose them further as needed to achieve higher normal forms using the normalization theory presented in this chapter and the next. We focus in Figure 14.8\\nA relation R(A, B, C, D) \\nwith its extension.ABCD\\na1 b1 c1 d1\\na1 b2 c2 d2\\na2 b2 c2 d3\\na3 b3 c4 d3'),\n",

More general definitions of these normal forms, which take into account all candidate keys of a relation rather than just the primary key, are deferred to Section 14.4.\\nWe start by informally discussing normal forms and the motivation behind their \\ndevelopment, as well as reviewing some definitions from Chapter 3 that are needed \\nhere. Then we discuss the first normal form (1NF) in Section 14.3.4, and we present \\nthe definitions of second normal form (2NF) and third normal form (3NF), which are based on primary keys, in Sections 14.3.5 and 14.3.6, respectively.\\n14.3.1 Normalization of Relations\\nThe normalization process, as first proposed by Codd (1972a), takes a relation schema through a series of tests to certify  whether it satisfies a certain normal form . \\nThe process, which proceeds in a top-down fashion by evaluating each relation against the criteria for normal forms and decomposing relations as necessary, can thus be considered as relational design by analysis.  Initially, Codd proposed three \\nnormal forms, which he called first, second, and third normal form. A stronger definition of 3NF—called Boyce-Codd normal form (BCNF)—was proposed later by Boyce and Codd. All these normal forms are based on a single analytical tool: the functional dependencies among the attributes of a relation. Later, a fourth normal form (4NF) and a fifth normal form (5NF) were proposed, based on the concepts of multivalued dependencies and join dependencies, respectively; these are briefly dis-cussed in Sections 14.6 and 14.7.\\nNormalization of data  can be considered a process of analyzing the given relation \\nschemas based on their FDs and primary keys to achieve the desirable properties of (1) minimizing redundancy and (2) minimizing the insertion, deletion, and update anomalies discussed in Section 14.1.2. It can be considered as a “filtering” or “purifi-cation” process to make the design have successively better quality. An unsatisfactory relation schema that does not meet the condition for a normal form—the normal \\nform test —is decomposed into smaller relation schemas that contain a subset of the \\nattributes and meet the test that was otherwise not met by the original relation. Thus, the normalization procedure provides database designers with the following:\\n ■A formal framework for analyzing relation schemas based on their keys and \\non the functional dependencies among their attributes\\n ■A series of normal form tests that can be carried out on individual relation \\nschemas so that the relational database can be normalized  to any desired \\ndegree\\nDefinition.  The normal form  of a relation refers to the highest normal form \\ncondition that it meets, and hence indicates the degree to which it has been \\nnormalized.\\nNormal forms, when considered in isolation  from other factors, do not guarantee a \\ngood database design. It is generally not sufficient to check separately that each'),\n",

Rather, the process of nor-\\nmalization through decomposition must also confirm the existence of additional properties that the relational schemas, taken together, should possess. These would include two properties:\\n ■The nonadditive join or lossless join property , which guarantees that the \\nspurious tuple generation problem discussed in Section 14.1.4 does not occur with respect to the relation schemas created after decomposition\\n ■The dependency preservation property , which ensures that each functional \\ndependency is represented in some individual relation resulting after decomposition\\nThe nonadditive join property is extremely critical and must be achieved at any \\ncost, whereas the dependency preservation property, although desirable, is some-\\ntimes sacrificed, as we discuss in Section 15.2.2. We defer the discussion of the for-mal concepts and techniques that guarantee the above two properties to Chapter 15.\\n14.3.2 Practical Use of Normal Forms\\nMost practical design projects in commercial and governmental environment acquire existing designs of databases from previous designs, from designs in legacy models, or from existing files. They are certainly interested in assuring that the designs are good quality and sustainable over long periods of time. Existing designs are evaluated by applying the tests for normal forms, and normalization is carried out in practice so that the resulting designs are of high quality and meet the desirable properties stated previously. Although several higher normal forms have been defined, such as the 4NF and 5NF that we discuss in Sections 14.6 and 14.7, the practical utility of these normal forms becomes questionable. The reason is that the constraints on which they are based are rare and hard for the database designers and users to understand or to detect. Designers and users must either already know them or discover them as a part of the business. Thus, database design as practiced in industry today pays particular attention to normalization only up to 3NF, BCNF, or at most 4NF.\\nAnother point worth noting is that the database designers need not  normalize to the \\nhighest possible normal form. Relations may be left in a lower normalization status, such as 2NF, for performance reasons, such as those discussed at the end of Sec- tion 14.1.2. Doing so incurs the corresponding penalties of dealing with the anomalies.\\nDefinition.  Denormalization  is the process of storing the join of higher nor-\\nmal form relations as a base relation, which is in a lower normal form.\\n14.3.3 Definitions of Keys and Attributes Participating in Keys\\nBefore proceeding further, let’s look again at the definitions of keys of a relation schema from Chapter 3.\\nDefinition.  A superkey  of a relation schema R = {A\\n1, A2, … , An} is a set of attri-\\nbutes S ⊆ R with the property that no two tuples t1 and t2 in any legal relation \\nstate r of R will have t1[S] = t2[S]. A key K is a superkey with the additional property \\nthat removal of any attribute from K will cause K not to be a superkey anymore.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 507}, page_content='14.3 Normal Forms Based on Primary Keys  477\\nThe difference between a key and a superkey is that a key has to be minimal;  that is, \\nif we have a key K = {A1, A2, … , Ak} of R, then K − {Ai} is not a key of R for any Ai, \\n1 ≤ i ≤ k. In Figure 14.1, { Ssn} is a key for EMPLOYEE , whereas { Ssn}, {Ssn, Ename }, \\n{Ssn, Ename , Bdate }, and any set of attributes that includes Ssn are all superkeys.\\nIf a relation schema has more than one key, each is called a candidate key . One of \\nthe candidate keys is arbitrarily  designated to be the primary key , and the others \\nare called secondary keys. In a practical relational database, each relation schema must have a primary key. If no candidate key is known for a relation, the entire rela-tion can be treated as a default superkey. In Figure 14.1, {\\nSsn} is the only candidate \\nkey for EMPLOYEE , so it is also the primary key.\\nDefinition.  An attribute of relation schema R is called a prime attribute  of R if \\nit is a member of some candidate key  of R. An attribute is called nonprime  if it \\nis not a prime attribute—that is, if it is not a member of any candidate key.\\nIn Figure 14.1, both Ssn and Pnumber  are prime attributes of WORKS_ON , whereas \\nother attributes of WORKS_ON  are nonprime.\\nWe now present the first three normal forms: 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF. These were pro-\\nposed by Codd (1972a) as a sequence to achieve the desirable state of 3NF relations by progressing through the intermediate states of 1NF and 2NF if needed. As we shall see, 2NF and 3NF independently attack different types of problems arising \\nfrom problematic functional dependencies among attributes. However, for histori-\\ncal reasons, it is customary to follow them in that sequence; hence, by definition a \\n3NF relation already satisfies  2NF.\\n14.3.4 First Normal Form\\nFirst normal form (1NF )is now considered to be part of the formal definition of a \\nrelation in the basic (flat) relational model; historically, it was defined to disallow \\nmultivalued attributes, composite attributes, and their combinations. It states that \\nthe domain of an attribute must include only atomic  (simple, indivisible) values  and \\nthat the value of any attribute in a tuple must be a single value  from the domain of \\nthat attribute. Hence, 1NF disallows having a set of values, a tuple of values, or a combination of both as an attribute value for a single tuple.  In other words, 1NF \\ndisallows relations within relations  or relations as attribute values within tuples . The \\nonly attribute values permitted by 1NF are single atomic  (or indivisible ) values .\\nConsider the \\nDEPARTMENT  relation schema shown in Figure 14.1, whose primary \\nkey is Dnumber , and suppose that we extend it by including the Dlocations  attribute \\nas shown in Figure 14.9(a). We assume that each department can have a number of  \\nlocations. The DEPARTMENT  schema and a sample relation state are shown in Fig-\\nure 14.9. As we can see, this is not in 1NF because Dlocations  is not an atomic attri-\\nbute, as illustrated by the first tuple in Figure 14.9(b). There are two ways we can \\nlook at the Dlocations  attribute:\\n ■The domain of Dlocations  contains atomic values, but some tuples can have a \\nset of these values. In this ca se, Dlocations  is not functionally dependent on \\nthe primary key Dnumber .'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 508}, page_content='478 Chapter 14 Basics of Functional Dependencies and Normalization for Relational Databases\\n ■The domain of Dlocations  contains sets of values and hence is nonatomic. In \\nthis case, Dnumber  → Dlocations  because each set is considered a single mem-\\nber of the attribute domain.10\\nIn either case, the DEPARTMENT  relation in Figure 14.9 is not in 1NF; in fact, it does \\nnot even qualify as a relation according to our definition of relation in Section 3.1. There are three main techniques to achieve first normal form for such a relation:\\n  1. Remove the attribute Dlocations  that violates 1NF and place it in a separate \\nrelation DEPT_LOCATIONS  along with the primary key Dnumber  of  \\nDEPARTMENT . The primary key of this newly formed relation is the combi-\\nnation { Dnumber , Dlocation }, as shown in Figure 14.2. A distinct tuple in \\nDEPT_LOCATIONS  exists for each location  of a department. This decom-\\nposes the non-1NF relation into two 1NF relations.DnameDEPARTMENT(a)\\nDEPARTMENT(b)\\nDEPARTMENT(c)Dnumber Dmgr_ssn Dlocations\\nDname\\nResearch\\nAdministration\\nHeadquarters 15\\n4Dnumber\\n8886 65555333445555\\n987654321Dmgr_ssn\\n{Houston}{Bellaire, Sugarland, Houston}\\n{Stafford}Dlocations\\nDname\\nResearch\\nResearch\\nResearch\\nAdministration\\nHeadquartersBellaire\\nSugarland\\nHouston\\nStafford\\nHouston55\\n5\\n4\\n1Dnumber\\n333445555333445555\\n333445555\\n987654321\\n8886 65555Dmgr_ssn Dlocation\\nFigure 14.9 \\nNormalization into 1NF.

Expand the key so that there will be a separate tuple in the original  \\nDEPARTMENT  relation for each location of a DEPARTMENT , as shown in Fig-\\nure 14.9(c). In this case, the primary key becomes the combination { Dnumber , \\nDlocation }. This solution has the disadvantage of introducing redundancy  in \\nthe relation and hence is rarely adopted.\\n  3. If a maximum number of values  is known for the attribute—for example, if it \\nis known that at most three locations  can exist for a department—replace the \\nDlocations  attribute by three atomic attributes: Dlocation1 , Dlocation2 , and \\nDlocation3 . This solution has the disadvantage of introducing NULL  values  if \\nmost departments have fewer than three locations. It further introduces spurious semantics about the ordering among the location values; that ordering  is not originally intended. Querying on this attribute becomes more \\ndifficult; for example, consider how you would write the query: List the \\ndepartments that have ‘Bellaire’ as one of their locations  in this design. For all \\nthese reasons, it is best to avoid this alternative.\\nOf the three solutions above, the first is generally considered best because it \\ndoes not suffer from redundancy and it is completely general; it places no max-imum limit on the number of values. In fact, if we choose the second solution, it will be decomposed further during subsequent normalization steps into the first solution.\\nFirst normal form also disallows multivalued attributes that are themselves com-\\nposite. These are called nested relations  because each tuple can have a relation \\nwithin it.  Figure 14.10 shows how the \\nEMP_PROJ  relation could appear if nesting is \\nallowed. Each tuple represents an employee entity, and a relation PROJS(Pnumber, \\nHours ) within each tuple  represents the employee’s projects and the hours per week \\nthat employee works on each project. The schema of this EMP_PROJ  relation can be \\nrepresented as follows:\\nEMP_PROJ(Ssn, Ename, {PROJS(Pnumber, Hours)})\\nThe set braces { } identify the attribute PROJS  as multivalued, and we list the com-\\nponent attributes that form PROJS  between parentheses ( ). Interestingly, recent \\ntrends for supporting complex objects (see Chapter 12) and XML data (see Chap-\\nter 13) attempt to allow and formalize nested relations within relational database \\nsystems, which were disallowed early on by 1NF.\\nNotice that Ssn is the primary key of the EMP_PROJ  relation in Figures 14.10(a)  \\nand (b), whereas Pnumber  is the partial  key of the nested relation; that is, within each \\ntuple, the nested relation must have unique values of Pnumber . To normalize this \\ninto 1NF, we remove the nested relation attributes into a new relation and propa-\\ngate the primary key  into it; the primary key of the new relation will combine the \\npartial key with the primary key of the original relation. Decomposition and pri-\\nmary key propagation yield the schemas EMP_PROJ1  and EMP_PROJ2 , as shown in \\nFigure 14.10(c).\\nThis procedure can be applied recursively to a relation with multiple-level nesting \\nto unnest  the relation into a set of 1NF relations.

For practical purposes, the object is treated as an atomic, single-valued attribute and hence it maintains the 1NF status of the relation.\\n14.3.5 Second Normal Form\\nSecond normal form (2NF)  is based on the concept of full functional dependency.  \\nA functional dependency X → Y is a full functional dependency  if removal of any \\nattribute A from X means that the dependency does not hold anymore; that is, for \\nany attribute A ε X, (X − {A}) does not functionally determine Y. A functional \\ndependency X → Y is a partial dependency  if some attribute A ε X can be removed \\nfrom X and the dependency still holds; that is, for some A ε X, (X − {A}) → Y. In \\nFigure 14.3(b), { Ssn, Pnumber } → Hours  is a full dependency (neither Ssn → Hours  \\nnor Pnumber  → Hours  holds). However, the dependency { Ssn, Pnumber } → Ename  is \\npartial because Ssn → Ename  holds.\\nDefinition.  A relation schema R is in 2NF if every nonprime attribute A in R is \\nfully functionally dependent  on the primary key of R.\\nThe test for 2NF involves testing for functional dependencies whose left-hand side \\nattributes are part of the primary key. If the primary key contains a single attribute, the test need not be applied at all. The \\nEMP_PROJ  relation in Figure 14.3(b) is in'),\n",

The nonprime attribute Ename  violates 2NF because of FD2, \\nas do the nonprime attributes Pname  and Plocation  because of FD3.

Intuitively, we can see that the dependency of Dmgr_ssn  \\non Dnumber  is undesirable in EMP_DEPT  since Dnumber  is not a key of EMP_DEPT .\\nDefinition.  According to Codd’s original definition, a relation schema R is in \\n3NF  if it satisfies 2NF and no nonprime attribute of R is transitively dependent \\non the primary key.\\nThe relation schema EMP_DEPT  in Figure 14.3(a) is in 2NF, since no partial depen-\\ndencies on a key exist. However, EMP_DEPT  is not in 3NF because of the transitive \\ndependency of Dmgr_ssn  (and also Dname ) on Ssn via Dnumber . We can normalize \\nEMP_DEPT  by decomposing it into the two 3NF relation schemas ED1 and ED2 \\nshown in Figure 14.11(b). Intuitively, we see that ED1 and ED2 represent indepen-\\ndent facts about employees and departments, both of which are entities in their own right. A \\nNATURAL JOIN  operation on ED1 and ED2 will recover the original \\nrelation EMP_DEPT  without generating spurious tuples.\\nIntuitively, we can see that any functional dependency in which the left-hand side is \\npart (a proper subset) of the primary key, or any functional dependency in which the \\nleft-hand side is a nonkey attribute, is a problematic  FD. 2NF and 3NF normalization \\nremove these problem FDs by decomposing the original relation into new relations. In terms of the normalization process, it is not necessary to remove the partial dependen-cies before the transitive dependencies, but historically, 3NF has been defined with the assumption that a relation is tested for 2NF first before it is tested for 3NF. Moreover, the general definition of 3NF we present in Section 14.4.2 automatically covers the condition that the relation also satisfies 2NF. Table 14.1 informally summarizes the three normal forms based on primary keys, the tests used in each case, and the corre-sponding remedy  or normalization performed to achieve the normal form.\\n14.4  General Definitions of Second  \\nand Third Normal Forms\\nIn general, we want to design our relation schemas so that they have neither partial \\nnor transitive dependencies because these types of dependencies cause the update anomalies discussed in Section 14.1.2.

The normalization procedure described so far is useful for analysis \\nin practical situations for a given database where primary keys have already been defined. These definitions, however, do not take other candidate keys of a relation, if any, into account. In this section we give the more general definitions of 2NF and 3NF that take all candidate keys of a relation into account. Notice that this does not \\naffect the definition of 1NF since it is independent of keys and functional depen-dencies.

A relation schema R is in second normal form (2NF)  if every \\nnonprime attribute A in R is not partially dependent on any key of R.12\\nThe test for 2NF involves testing for functional dependencies whose left-hand side \\nattributes are part of  the primary key. If the primary key contains a single attribute, \\nthe test need not be applied at all. Consider the relation schema LOTS  shown in \\nFigure 14.12(a), which describes parcels of land for sale in various counties of a \\nstate. Suppose that there are two candidate keys: Property_id#  and { County_name , \\nLot# }; that is, lot numbers are unique only within each county, but Property_id#  \\nnumbers are unique across counties for the entire state.Table 14.1 Summary of Normal Forms Based on Primary Keys and Corresponding Normalization\\nNormal Form Test Remedy (Normalization)\\nFirst (1NF) Relation should have no multivalued  \\nattributes or nested relations.Form new relations for each multivalued \\nattribute or nested relation.\\nSecond (2NF) For relations where primary key  \\ncontains multiple attributes, no nonkey attribute should be functionally  dependent on a part of the primary key.Decompose and set up a new relation \\nfor each partial key with its dependent attribute(s).

Here we typi-\\ncally have a transitive dependency that violates 3NF.\\n ■A proper subset of a key of R functionally determines a nonprime attribute. \\nHere we have a partial dependency that violates 2NF.\\nThus, condition (a) alone addresses the problematic dependencies that were causes \\nfor second and third normalization as we discussed.\\nTherefore, we can state a general alternative definition of 3NF  as follows:\\nAlternative Definition. A relation schema R is in 3NF if every nonprime attribute \\nof R meets both of the following conditions:\\n ■It is fully functionally dependent on every key of R.\\n ■It is nontransitively dependent on every key of R.\\nHowever, note the clause (b) in the general definition of 3NF. It allows certain func-\\ntional dependencies to slip through or escape in that they are OK with the 3NF definition and hence are not “caught” by the 3NF definition even though they may be potentially problematic. The Boyce-Codd normal form “catches” these depen-dencies in that it does not allow them. We discuss that normal form next.\\n14.5 Boyce-Codd Normal Form\\nBoyce-Codd normal form (BCNF)  was proposed as a simpler form of 3NF, but it \\nwas found to be stricter than 3NF. That is, every relation in BCNF is also in 3NF; however, a relation in 3NF is not necessarily  in BCNF. We pointed out in the last \\nsubsection that although 3NF allows functional dependencies that conform to the clause (b) in the 3NF definition, BCNF disallows them and hence is a stricter defini-tion of a normal form.\\nIntuitively, we can see the need for a stronger normal form than 3NF by going back to \\nthe \\nLOTS  relation schema in Figure 14.12(a) with its four functional dependencies FD1 \\nthrough FD4. Suppose that we have thousands of lots in the relation but the lots are \\nfrom only two counties: DeKalb and Fulton. Suppose also that lot sizes in DeKalb \\nCounty are only 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and 1.0 acres, whereas lot sizes in Fulton County'),\n",

In such a situation we would have the \\nadditional functional dependency FD5: Area → County_name . If we add this to the other \\ndependencies, the relation schema LOTS1A  still is in 3NF because this f.d. conforms to \\nclause (b) in the general definition of 3NF, County_name  being a prime attribute.\\nThe area of a lot that determines the county, as specified by FD5, can be represented \\nby 16 tuples in a separate relation R(Area, County_name ), since there are only 16 pos-\\nsible Area values (see Figure 14.13). This representation reduces the redundancy of \\nrepeating the same information in the thousands of LOTS1A  tuples. BCNF is a \\nstronger normal form  that would disallow LOTS1A  and suggest the need for decom-\\nposing it.\\nDefinition.  A relation schema R is in BCNF  if whenever a nontrivial  functional \\ndependency X → A holds in R, then X is a superkey of R.\\nThe formal definition of BCNF differs from the definition of 3NF in that clause (b) \\nof 3NF, which allows f.d.’s having the RHS as a prime attribute, is absent from BCNF. That makes BCNF a stronger normal form compared to 3NF. In our exam-ple, \\nFD5 violates BCNF in LOTS1A  because Area is not a superkey of LOTS1A . We \\ncan decompose LOTS1A  into two BCNF relations LOTS1AX  and LOTS1AY , shown \\nin Figure 14.13(a).

In the third decomposition, the R1 ∩ R2 for the above \\ntest  is Instructor and R1 − R2 is Course. Because Instructor → Course, the NJB test \\nis satisfied and the decomposition is nonadditive. (It is left as an exercise for the reader to show that the first two decompositions do not meet the NJB test.) Hence, the proper decomposition of TEACH into BCNF relations is:\\nTEACH1 (\\nInstructor , Course ) and TEACH2 ( Instructor , Student )\\nWe make sure that we meet this property, because nonadditive decomposition is \\na must during normalization. You should verify that this property holds with respect to our informal successive normalization examples in Sections 14.3 and\\xa0 14.4 and also by the decomposition of \\nLOTS1A  into two BCNF relations \\n LOTS1AX  and LOTS1AY .\\nIn general, a relation R not in BCNF can be decomposed so as to meet the nonaddi-\\ntive join property by the following procedure.16 It decomposes R successively into a \\nset of relations that are in BCNF:\\nLet R be the relation not in BCNF, let X ⊆ R, and let X → A be the FD that \\ncauses a violation of BCNF.

Similarly, applying this proce-\\ndure to TEACH results in relations TEACH1 and TEACH2\\n15The notation F+ refers to the cover of the set of functional dependencies and includes all f.d.’s implied \\nby F. It is discussed in detail in Section 15.1. Here, it is enough to make sure that one of the two f.d.’s \\nactually holds for the nonadditive decomposition into R1 and  R2 to pass this test.\\n16Note that this procedure is based on Algorithm 15.5 from Chapter 15 for producing BCNF schemas \\nby decomposition of a universal schema.'),\n",

This FD may be removed as a part of second normaliza-\\ntion (or by a direct application of the above procedure to achieve BCNF) yielding exactly the same two relations in the result. This is an example of a case where we may reach the same ultimate BCNF design via alternate paths of normalization.\\n14.6  Multivalued Dependency  \\nand Fourth Normal Form\\nConsider the relation EMP  shown in Figure 14.15(a). A tuple in this EMP  relation \\nrepresents the fact that an employee whose name is Ename  works on the project \\nwhose name is Pname  and has a dependent whose name is Dname . An employee \\nmay work on several projects and may have several dependents, and the employee’s projects and dependents are independent of one another.\\n17 To keep the relation \\nstate consistent and to avoid any spurious relationship between the two indepen-dent attributes, we must have a separate tuple to represent every combination of an employee’s dependent and an employee’s project. In the relation state shown in Figure 14.15(a), the employee with Ename Smith works on two projects ‘X’ and ‘Y’ and has two dependents ‘John’ and ‘Anna’, and therefore there are four tuples to represent these facts together. The relation EMP is an all-key relation  (with key \\nmade up of all attributes) and therefore has no f.d.’s and as such qualifies to be a BCNF relation. We can see that there is an obvious redundancy in the relation EMP—the dependent information is repeated for every project and the project information is repeated for every dependent.\\nAs illustrated by the EMP relation, some relations have constraints that cannot be \\nspecified as functional dependencies and hence are not in violation of BCNF. To address this situation, the concept of multivalued dependency  (MVD) was proposed \\nand, based on this dependency, the fourth normal form  was defined. A more formal \\ndiscussion of MVDs and their properties is deferred to Chapter 15. Multivalued depen-dencies are a consequence of first normal form (1NF) (see Section 14.3.4), which disal-lows an attribute in a tuple to have a set of values . If more than one multivalued attribute \\nis present, the second option of normalizing the relation (see Section 14.3.4) intro-duces a multivalued dependency. Informally, whenever two independent  1:N relation-\\nships A:B and A:C are mixed in the same relation, R(A, B, C), an MVD may arise.\\n18\\n14.6.1 Formal Definition of Multivalued Dependency\\nDefinition.

These binary decompositions must obey the NJB property for which we introduced a test in Section 14.5 while discussing the decomposition to achieve BCNF. Achiev-ing 4NF typically involves eliminating MVDs by repeated binary decompositions as well. However, in some cases there may be no nonadditive join decomposition of R \\ninto two relation schemas, but there may be a nonadditive join decomposition into \\nmore than two  relation schemas. Moreover, there may be no functional dependency \\nin R that violates any normal form up to BCNF, and there may be no nontrivial \\nMVD present in R either that violates 4NF. We then resort to another dependency \\ncalled the join dependency  and, if it is present, carry out a multiway decomposition  \\ninto fifth normal form (5NF). It is important to note that such a dependency is a peculiar semantic constraint that is difficult to detect in practice; therefore, normal-ization into 5NF is rarely done in practice.\\nDefinition.  A join dependency  (JD), denoted by JD( R\\n1, R2, … , Rn), specified \\non relation schema R, specifies a constraint on the states r of R. The constraint \\nstates that every legal state r of R should have a nonadditive join decomposition \\ninto R1, R2, … , Rn. Hence, for every such r we have\\n* (πR1(r), πR2(r), … , πRn(r)) = r\\nNotice that an MVD is a special case of a JD where n = 2. That is, a JD denoted  \\nas JD( R1, R2) implies an MVD ( R1 ∩ R2) →→ (R1 − R2)(or, by symmetry,  \\n(R1 ∩ R2) →→ (R2 − R1)). A join dependency JD( R1, R2, … , Rn), specified on relation \\nschema R, is a trivial  JD if one of the relation schemas Ri in JD( R1, R2, … , Rn) is equal \\nto R. Such a dependency is called trivial because it has the nonadditive join property \\nfor any relation state r of R and thus does not specify any constraint on R. We can \\nnow define the fifth normal form, which is also called project-join normal form.\\nDefinition.  A relation schema R is in fifth normal form (5NF)  (or project-join \\nnormal form (PJNF) ) with respect to a set F of functional, multivalued, and \\njoin dependencies if, for every nontrivial join dependency JD( R1, R2, … , Rn) in \\nF+ (that is, implied by F),22 every Ri is a superkey of R.\\n22Again, F+ refers to the cover of functional dependencies F, or all dependencies that are implied by F. \\nThis is defined in Section 15.1.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 525}, page_content='14.6 Summary  495\\nFor an example of a JD, consider once again the SUPPLY  all-key relation in Fig- \\nure 14.15(c). Suppose that the following additional constraint always holds: Whenever a supplier s supplies part p, and a project j uses part p, and the supplier s supplies at \\nleast one  part to project j, then  supplier s will also be supplying part p to project j. \\nThis constraint can be restated in other ways and specifies a join dependency JD(R\\n1, R2, R3) among the three projections R1 (Sname,  Part_name ), R2 (Sname,  \\nProj_ name ), and R3 (Part_name, Proj_name ) of SUPPLY . If this constraint holds, the \\ntuples below the dashed line in Figure 14.15(c) must exist in any legal state of the \\nSUPPLY  relation that also contains the tuples above the dashed line. Figure 14.15(d) \\nshows how the SUPPLY  relation with the join dependency  is decomposed into three \\nrelations R1, R2, and R3 that are each in 5NF. Notice that applying a natural join to \\nany two  of these relations produces spurious tuples,  but applying a natural join to \\nall three together  does not. The reader should verify this on the sample relation in \\nFigure 14.15(c) and its projections in Figure 14.15(d). This is because only the JD exists, but no MVDs are specified. Notice, too, that the JD( R\\n1, R2, R3) is specified on \\nall legal relation states, not just on the one shown in Figure 14.15(c).\\nDiscovering JDs in practical databases with hundreds of attributes is next to impos-\\nsible. It can be done only with a great degree of intuition about the data on the part of the designer. Therefore, the current practice of database design pays scant atten-tion to them. One result due to Date and Fagin (1992) relates to conditions detected using f.d.’s alone and ignores JDs completely. It states: “If a relation schema is in 3NF and each of its keys consists of a single attribute, it is also in 5NF.”\\n14.8 Summary\\nIn this chapter we discussed several pitfalls in relational database design using intu-itive arguments. We identified informally some of the measures for indicating whether a relation schema is good  or bad, and we provided informal guidelines for \\na good design. These guidelines are based on doing a careful conceptual design in \\nthe ER and EER model, following the mapping procedure in Chapter 9 to map enti-ties and relationships into relations. Proper enforcement of these guidelines and lack of redundancy will avoid the insertion/deletion/update anomalies and genera-tion of spurious data. We recommended limiting \\nNULL  values, which cause prob-\\nlems during SELECT , JOIN , and aggregation operations. Then we presented some \\nformal concepts that allow us to do relational design in a top-down fashion by ana-lyzing relations individually. We defined this process of design by analysis and decomposition by introducing the process of normalization.\\nWe defined the concept of functional dependency, which is the basic tool for ana-\\nlyzing relational schemas, and we discussed some of its properties. Functional \\ndependencies specify semantic constraints among the attributes of a relation \\nschema. Next we described the normalization process for achieving good designs by testing relations for undesirable types of problematic  functional dependencies. \\nWe provided a treatment of successive normalization based on a predefined pri-mary key in each relation, and we then relaxed this requirement and provided more'),\n",

We presented examples to illus-trate how, by using the general definition of 3NF, a given relation may be analyzed and decomposed to eventually yield a set of relations in 3NF.\\nWe presented Boyce-Codd normal form (BCNF) and discussed how it is a stronger \\nform of 3NF. We also illustrated how the decomposition of a non-BCNF relation \\nmust be done by considering the nonadditive decomposition requirement. We pre-\\nsented a test for the nonadditive join property of binary decompositions and also gave a general algorithm to convert any relation not in BCNF into a set of BCNF relations. We motivated the need for an additional constraint beyond the functional dependencies based on mixing of independent multivalued attributes into a single relation. We introduced multivalued dependency (MVD) to address such condi-tions and defined the fourth normal form based on MVDs. Finally, we introduced the fifth normal form, which is based on join dependency and which identifies a peculiar constraint that causes a relation to be decomposed into several compo-nents so that they always yield the original relation after a join. In practice, most commercial designs have followed the normal forms up to BCNF. The need to decompose into 5NF rarely arises in practice, and join dependencies are difficult to detect for most practical situations, making 5NF more of theoretical value.\\nChapter 15 presents synthesis as well as decomposition algorithms for relational \\ndatabase design based on functional dependencies. Related to decomposition, we discuss the concepts of nonadditive  (or lossless ) join and dependency preservation,  \\nwhich are enforced by some of these algorithms. Other topics in Chapter 15 include a more detailed treatment of functional and multivalued dependencies, and other types of dependencies.\\nReview Questions\\n 14.1.

The procedure involves designing an ER or EER conceptual schema and then mapping it to the relational model by a procedure such as the one described in Chapter 9. Primary keys are assigned to each relation based on known functional dependencies. In the subsequent process, which may be called relational design by analysis , initially designed relations from \\nthe above procedure—or those inherited from previous files, forms, and other sources—are analyzed to detect undesirable functional dependencies. These depen-dencies are removed by the successive normalization procedure that we described in Section 14.3 along with definitions of related normal forms, which are succes-sively better states of design of individual relations. In Section 14.3 we assumed that primary keys were assigned to individual relations; in Section 14.4 a more general treatment of normalization was presented where all candidate keys are considered for each relation, and Section 14.5 discussed a further normal form called BCNF. Then in Sections 14.6 and 14.7 we discussed two more types of dependencies—multivalued dependencies and join dependencies—that can also cause redundancies and showed how they can be eliminated with further normalization.\\nIn this chapter, we use the theory of normal forms and functional, multivalued, and \\njoin dependencies developed in the last chapter and build upon it while maintain-ing three different thrusts. First, we discuss the concept of inferring new functional dependencies from a given set and discuss notions including closure, cover, mini-mal cover, and equivalence.

Second, we discuss the desirable properties of nonadditive (lossless) joins and preservation of functional dependencies. A general algorithm to test for nonadditivity of joins among a set of relations is presented. Third, we present an approach to relational design by synthesis  of functional dependencies. This is a \\nbottom-up approach to design  that presupposes that the known functional depen-\\ndencies among sets of attributes in the Universe of Discourse (UoD) have been given as input. We present algorithms to achieve the desirable normal forms, namely 3NF and BCNF, and achieve one or both of the desirable properties of non-additivity of joins and functional dependency preservation. Although the synthesis approach is theoretically appealing as a formal approach, it has not been used in practice for large database design projects because of the difficulty of providing all possible functional dependencies up front before the design can be attempted. Alternately, with the approach presented in Chapter 14, successive decompositions and ongoing refinements to design become more manageable and may evolve over time. The final goal of this chapter is to discuss further the multivalued dependency (MVD) concept we introduced in Chapter 14 and briefly point out other types of dependencies that have been identified.\\nIn Section 15.1 we discuss the rules of inference for functional dependencies and \\nuse them to define the concepts of a cover, equivalence, and minimal cover among functional dependencies. In Section 15.2, first we describe the two desirable properties of decompositions , namely, the dependency preservation property \\nand the nonadditive (or lossless) join property, which are both used by the design algorithms to achieve desirable decompositions. It is important to note that it is insufficient  to test the relation schemas independently of one another  for compli-\\nance with higher normal forms like 2NF, 3NF, and BCNF. The resulting relations must collectively satisfy these two additional properties to qualify as a good design. Section 15.3 is devoted to the development of relational design algorithms that start off with one giant relation schema called the universal relation , which is a \\nhypothetical relation containing all the attributes. This relation is decomposed (or in other words, the given functional dependencies are synthesized) into relations that satisfy a certain normal form like 3NF or BCNF and also meet one or both of the desirable properties.\\nIn Section 15.5 we discuss the multivalued dependency (MVD) concept further by \\napplying the notions of inference, and equivalence to MVDs. Finally, in Sec- tion 15.6 we complete the discussion on dependencies among data by introducing inclusion dependencies and template dependencies. Inclusion dependencies can represent referential integrity constraints and class/subclass constraints across rela-tions. We also describe some situations where a procedure or function is needed to state and verify a functional dependency among attributes. Then we briefly discuss domain-key normal form (DKNF), which is considered the most general normal form. Section 15.7 summarizes this chapter.\\nIt is possible to skip some or all of Sections 15.3, 15.4, and 15.5 in an introductory \\ndatabase course.'),\n",

We identified and discussed problematic functional dependencies in Sections 14.3 and 14.4 and showed how they can be eliminated by a proper decom-position of a relation. This process was described as normalization , and we showed \\nhow to achieve the first through third normal forms (1NF through 3NF) given pri-mary keys in Section 14.3. In Sections 14.4 and 14.5 we provided generalized tests for 2NF, 3NF, and BCNF given any number of candidate keys in a relation and showed how to achieve them. Now we return to the study of functional dependencies and show how new dependencies can be inferred from a given set and discuss the con-cepts of closure, equivalence, and minimal cover that we will need when we later consider a synthesis approach to design of relations given a set of FDs.\\n15.1.1 Inference Rules for Functional Dependencies\\nWe denote by F the set of functional dependencies that are specified on relation \\nschema R. Typically, the schema designer specifies the functional dependencies \\nthat are semantically obvious ; usually, however, numerous other functional \\ndependencies hold in all legal relation instances among sets of attributes that can \\nbe derived from and satisfy the dependencies in F. Those other dependencies can \\nbe inferred  or deduced  from the FDs in F. We call them as inferred or implied \\nfunctional dependencies.\\nDefinition: An FD X → Y is inferred from  or implied by  a set of dependencies \\nF specified on R if X → Y holds in every  legal relation state r of R; that is, when-\\never r satisfies all the dependencies in F, X → Y also holds in r.\\nIn real life, it is impossible to specify all possible functional dependencies for a given \\nsituation. For example, if each department has one manager, so that Dept_no  \\nuniquely determines Mgr_ssn  (Dept_no  → Mgr_ssn ), and a manager has a unique \\nphone number called Mgr_phone  (Mgr_ssn  → Mgr_phone ), then these two dependen-\\ncies together imply that Dept_no  → Mgr_phone . This is an inferred or implied FD \\nand need not be explicitly stated in addition to the two given FDs. Therefore, it is \\nuseful to define a concept called closure  formally that includes all possible depen-\\ndencies that can be inferred from the given set F.\\nDefinition. Formally, the set of all dependencies that include F as well as all \\ndependencies that can be inferred from F is called the closure  of F; it is denoted \\nby F+.\\nFor example, suppose that we specify the following set F of obvious functional \\ndependencies on the relation schema in Figure 14.3(a):\\nF = {Ssn  → {Ename, Bdate, Address, Dnumber}, Dnumber  → {Dname, Dmgr_ssn} }'),\n",

To determine a systematic way to infer dependencies, we must discover a \\nset of inference rules  that can be used to infer new dependencies from a given set of \\ndependencies. We consider some of these inference rules next. We use the notation F |=X → Y to denote that the functional dependency X → Y is inferred from the set \\nof functional dependencies F.\\nIn the following discussion, we use an abbreviated notation when discussing func-\\ntional dependencies. We concatenate attribute variables and drop the commas  for convenience. Hence, the FD { X,Y} → Z is abbreviated to XY → Z, and the  \\nFD { X, Y, Z} → {U, V} is abbreviated to XYZ  → UV. We present below three rules \\nIR1 through IR3 that are well-known inference rules for functional dependencies. \\nThey were proposed first by Armstrong (1974) and hence are known as  \\nArmstrong’s axioms .1\\nIR1 (reflexive rule)2: If X ⊇ Y, then X →Y.\\nIR2 (augmentation rule)3: {X → Y} |=XZ → YZ.\\nIR3 (transitive rule): { X → Y, Y → Z} |=X → Z.\\nArmstrong has shown that inference rules IR1 through IR3 are sound and complete. \\nBy sound , we mean that given a set of functional dependencies F specified on a rela-\\ntion schema R, any dependency that we can infer from F by using IR1 through IR3 \\nholds in every relation state r of R that satisfies the dependencies  in F. By complete , \\nwe mean that using IR1 through IR3 repeatedly to infer dependencies until no more \\ndependencies can be inferred results in the complete set of all possible dependencies  \\nthat can be inferred from F. In other words, the set of dependencies F+, which we \\ncalled the closure  of F, can be determined from F by using only inference rules IR1 \\nthrough IR3.\\nThe reflexive rule ( IR1) states that a set of attributes always determines itself or any of its \\nsubsets, which is obvious. Because IR1 generates dependencies that are always true, such \\ndependencies are called trivial . Formally, a functional dependency X → Y is trivial  if \\nX ⊇ Y; otherwise, it is nontrivial . The augmentation rule ( IR2) says that adding the \\nsame set of attributes to both the left- and right-hand sides of a dependency results in \\nanother valid dependency. According to IR3, functional dependencies are transitive.\\n1They are actually inference rules rather than axioms. In the strict mathematical sense, the axioms  (given \\nfacts) are the functional dependencies in F, since we assume that they are correct, whereas IR1 through \\nIR3 are the inference rules  for inferring new functional dependencies (new facts).\\n2The reflexive rule can also be stated as X → X; that is, any set of attributes functionally determines itself.\\n3The augmentation rule can also be stated as X → Y |= XZ → Y; that is, augmenting the left-hand-side \\nattributes of an FD produces another valid FD.'),\n",

A proof by contradiction \\nassumes that the rule does not hold and shows that this is not possible. We now prove that the first three rules \\nIR1 through IR3 are valid. The second proof is by contradiction.\\nProof of IR1.  Suppose that X ⊇ Y and that two tuples t1 and t2 exist in some rela-\\ntion instance r of R such that t1 [X] = t2 [X]. Then t1[Y] = t2[Y] because X ⊇ Y; \\nhence, X → Y must hold in r.\\nProof of IR2 (by contradiction).  Assume that X → Y holds in a relation instance \\nr of R but that XZ → YZ does not hold. Then there must exist two tuples t1 \\nand t2 in r such that (1) t1 [X] = t2 [X], (2) t1 [Y] = t2 [Y], (3) t1 [XZ] = t2 [XZ], \\nand (4) t1 [YZ] ≠ t2 [YZ]. This is not possible because from (1) and (3) we \\ndeduce (5) t1 [Z] = t2 [Z], and from (2) and (5) we deduce (6) t1 [YZ] = t2 [YZ], \\ncontradicting (4).\\nProof of IR3.  Assume that (1) X → Y and (2) Y → Z both hold in a relation r. \\nThen for any two tuples t1 and t2 in r such that t1 [X] = t2 [X], we must have (3) \\nt1 [Y] = t2 [Y], from assumption (1); hence we must also have (4) t1 [Z] = t2 [Z] \\nfrom (3) and assumption (2); thus X → Z must hold in r.\\nThere are three other inference rules that follow from IR1, IR2 and IR3. They are \\nas follows:\\nIR4 (decomposition, or projective, rule): { X → YZ} |=X → Y.\\nIR5 (union, or additive, rule): { X → Y, X → Z} |=X → YZ.\\nIR6 (pseudotransitive rule): { X → Y, WY → Z} |=W X → Z.\\nThe decomposition rule ( IR4) says that we can remove attributes from the right-\\nhand side of a dependency; applying this rule repeatedly can decompose the  FD X → {A\\n1, A2, … , An} into the set of dependencies { X → A1, X → A2, … , X → An}. \\nThe union rule ( IR5) allows us to do the opposite; we can combine a set of depen-\\ndencies { X → A1, X → A2, … , X → An} into the single FD X → {A1, A2, … , An}. \\nThe pseudotransitive rule (IR6) allows us to replace a set of attributes Y on the left-\\nhand side of a dependency with another set X that functionally determines Y, and \\ncan be derived from IR2 and IR3 if we augment the first functional dependency  X → Y with W (the augmentation rule) and then apply the transitive rule.\\nOne important cautionary note  regarding the use of these rules: Although X → A and \\nX → B implies X → AB by the union rule stated above, X → A and Y → B does imply \\nthat XY → AB. Also , XY → A does not necessarily imply either X → A or Y → A.\\nUsing similar proof arguments, we can prove the inference rules \\nIR4 to IR6 and any \\nadditional valid inference rules. However, a simpler way to prove that an inference \\nrule for functional dependencies is valid is to prove it by using inference rules that \\nhave already been shown to be valid. Thus IR4, IR5, and IR6 are regarded as a corol-\\nlary of the Armstrong’s basic inference rules. For example, we can prove IR4 through \\nIR6 by using IR1 through  IR3. We present the proof of IR5 below. Proofs of IR4 and IR6 \\nusing IR1 through IR3 are left as an exercise for the reader.'),\n",

X → YZ (using IR3 on 3 and 4).\\nTypically, database designers first specify the set of functional dependencies F that \\ncan easily be determined from the semantics of the attributes of R; then IR1, IR2, \\nand IR3 are used to infer additional functional dependencies that will also hold on \\nR. A systematic way to determine these additional functional dependencies is first \\nto determine each set of attributes X that appears as a left-hand side of some func-\\ntional dependency in F and then to determine the set of all attributes  that are depen-\\ndent on X.\\nDefinition. For each such set of attributes X, we determine the set X+ of attri-\\nbutes that are functionally determined by X based on F; X+ is called the closure \\nof X under  F.\\nAlgorithm 15.1 can be used to calculate X+.\\nAlgorithm 15.1. Determining X+, the Closure of X under F\\nInput:  A set F of FDs on a relation schema R, and a set of attributes X, which is \\na subset of R.\\nX+ := X;\\nrepeat\\n old X+ := X+;\\n for each functional dependency Y → Z in F do\\n  if X+ ⊇ Y then X+ := X+ ∪ Z;\\n until ( X+ = old X+);\\nAlgorithm 15.1 starts by setting X+ to all the attributes in X. By IR1, we know that all \\nthese attributes are functionally dependent on X. Using inference rules IR3 and IR4, \\nwe add attributes to X+, using each functional dependency in F. We keep going \\nthrough all the dependencies in F (the repeat  loop) until no more attributes are \\nadded to X+ during a complete cycle  (of the for loop) through the dependencies in F. \\nThe closure concept is useful in understanding the meaning and implications of attributes or sets of attributes in a relation. For example, consider the following relation schema about classes held at a university in a given academic year.\\nCLASS ( Classid, Course#, Instr_name, Credit_hrs, Text, Publisher, \\nClassroom, Capacity).\\nLet F, the set of functional dependencies for the above relation include the \\nfollowing f.d.s:\\nFD1: Sectionid → Course#, Instr_name, Credit_hrs, Text, Publisher, \\nClassroom, Capacity;'),\n",

For example, FD1 states that each class has a unique Classid. FD3 states that when a given course is offered by a certain instructor, the text is fixed and the instructor teaches that class in a fixed room. Using the inference rules about the FDs and applying the definition of closure, we can define the following closures:\\n{ Classid } + = { Classid , Course#, Instr_name, Credit_hrs, Text, Publisher, \\nClassroom, Capacity } = CLASS\\n{ Course# } + = { Course#, Credit_hrs }\\n{ Course#, Instr_name } + = { Course#, Credit_hrs , Text, Publisher, \\nClassroom, Capacity }\\nNote that each closure above has an interpretation that is revealing about the attribute(s) on the left-hand side. For example, the closure of Course# has only Credit_hrs besides itself. It does not include Instr_name because different instruc-tors could teach the same course; it does not include Text because different instruc-tors may use different texts for the same course. Note also that the closure of {Course#, Instr_nam\\n} does not include Classid, which implies that it is not a candi-\\ndate key. This further implies that a course with given Course# could be offered by different instructors, which would make the courses distinct classes.\\n15.1.2 Equivalence of Sets of Functional Dependencies\\nIn this section, we discuss the equivalence of two sets of functional dependencies. First, we give some preliminary definitions.\\nDefinition. A set of functional dependencies F is said to cover  another set of \\nfunctional dependencies E if every FD in E i s  a l s o  i n  F\\n+; that is, if every \\ndependency in E can be inferred from F; alternatively, we can say that E is \\ncovered by  F.\\nDefinition. Two sets of functional dependencies E and F are equivalent  if  \\nE+ = F+. Therefore, equivalence means that every FD in E can be inferred from \\nF, and every FD in F can be inferred from E; that is, E is equivalent to F if both \\nthe conditions— E covers F and F  covers E—hold.\\nWe can determine whether F covers E by calculating X+ with respect to F  for each \\nFD X → Y in E , and then checking whether this X+ includes the attributes in Y. If \\nthis is the case for every  FD in E, then F covers E. We determine whether E and F are \\nequivalent by checking that E covers F and F covers E. It is left to the reader as an \\nexercise to show that the following two sets of FDs are equivalent:\\nF = {A → C, AC → D, E → AD, E → H} \\nand G = {A → CD, E → AH}'),\n",

In addition, this property is lost if any dependency from the set F is removed; F \\nmust have no redundancies in it, and the dependencies in F are in a standard form.\\nWe will use the concept of an extraneous attribute in a functional dependency for \\ndefining the minimum cover.\\nDefinition: An attribute in a functional dependency is considered an extraneous \\nattribute  if we can remove it without changing the closure of the set of depen-\\ndencies. Formally, given F, the set of functional dependencies, and a functional \\ndependency X → A in F, attribute Y is extraneous in X if Y ⊂ X, and F logically \\nimplies (F − (X  → A) ∪ { (X − Y)  → A } ).\\nWe can formally define a set of functional dependencies F to be minimal  if it satis-\\nfies the following conditions:\\n  1. Every dependency in F has a single attribute for its right-hand side.\\n  2. We cannot replace any dependency X → A in F with a dependency Y → A, \\nwhere Y is a proper subset of X, and still have a set of dependencies that is \\nequivalent to F.\\n  3. We cannot remove any dependency from F and still have a set of dependen-\\ncies that is equivalent to F.\\nWe can think of a minimal set of dependencies as being a set of dependencies in a \\nstandard  or canonical form  and with no redundancies.  Condition 1 just represents \\nevery dependency in a canonical form with a single attribute on the right-hand side, and it is a preparatory step before we can evaluate if conditions 2 and 3 are met.\\n4 \\nConditions 2 and 3 ensure that there are no redundancies in the dependencies either by having redundant attributes (referred to as extraneous attributes) on the left-hand side of a dependency (Condition 2) or by having a dependency that can be inferred from the remaining FDs in F (Condition 3).\\nDefinition. A minimal cover  of a set of functional dependencies E is a mini-\\nmal set of dependencies (in the standard canonical form\\n5 and without redun-\\ndancy) that is equivalent to E. We can always find at least one  minimal cover F \\nfor any set of dependencies E using Algorithm 15.2.\\n4This is a standard form to simplify the conditions and algorithms that ensure no redundancy exists in F. \\nBy using the inference rule IR4, we can convert a single dependency with multiple attributes on the right-hand side into a set of dependencies with single attributes on the right-hand side.\\n5It is possible to use the inference rule IR5 and combine the FDs with the same left-hand side into a \\nsingle FD in the minimum cover in a nonstandard form. The resulting set is still a minimum cover, as illustrated in the example.'),\n",

For each functional dependency X → A in F\\n for each attribute B that is an element of X\\n  if { { F − {X → A} } ∪ { (X − {B} ) → A} } is equivalent to F\\n   then replace X → A with ( X − {B} ) → A in F. \\n(*This constitutes removal of an extra neous attribute B contained in the left-\\nhand side X of a functional dependency X → A when possible *)\\n  4. For each remaining functional dependency X → A in F\\nif {F − {X → A} } is equivalent to F,\\nthen remove X → A from F.

We have to \\nfind the minimal cover of E.\\n ■All above dependencies are in canonical form (that is, they have only one \\nattribute on the right-hand side), so we have completed step 1 of Algo- rithm 15.2 and can proceed to step 2.

Hence B → A is redundant in E′ and \\ncan be eliminated.\\n ■Therefore, the minimal cover of E is F: {B → D, D → A}.\\nThe reader can verify that the original set F can be inferred from E; in other words, \\nthe two sets F and E are equivalent.\\nExample 2:  Let the given set of FDs be G: {A → BCDE , CD → E}.\\n ■Here, the given FDs are NOT in the canonical form. So we first convert \\nthem into:\\nE: {A → B, A→ C, A→ D, A→ E, CD → E}.\\n ■In step 2 of the algorithm, for CD → E, neither C nor D is extraneous on the \\nleft-hand side , since we cannot show that C → E or D → E from the given \\nFDs. Hence we cannot replace it with either.\\n ■In step 3, we want to see if any FD is redundant. Since A→ CD and \\nCD → E, by transitive rule (IR3), we get A→ E.

We then remove one attribute at a time \\nand check whether the remaining attributes still form a superkey.

In Section 15.2.1, we give examples to show that looking at an individual  \\nrelation to test whether it is in a higher normal form does not, on its own, guarantee a good design; rather, a set of relations  that together form the relational database \\nschema must possess certain additional properties to ensure a good design. In Sec-tions 15.2.2 and 15.2.3, we discuss two of these properties: the dependency preser-vation property and the nonadditive (or lossless) join property. Section 15.2.4 discusses binary decompositions, and Section 15.2.5 discusses successive nonaddi-tive join decompositions.\\n15.2.1  Relation Decomposition and Insufficiency  \\nof Normal Forms\\nThe relational database design algorithms that we present in Section 15.3 start from \\na single universal relation schema  R = {A1, A2, … , An} that includes all the attri-\\nbutes of the database. We implicitly make the universal relation assumption , \\nwhich states that every attribute name is unique. The set F of functional dependen-\\ncies that should hold on the attributes of R is specified by the database designers \\nand is made available to the design algorithms. Using the functional dependencies, \\nthe algorithms decompose the universal relation schema R into a set of relation \\nschemas D = {R1, R2, … , Rm} that will become the relational database schema; D is \\ncalled a decomposition  of R.\\nWe must make sure that each attribute in R will appear in at least one relation \\nschema Ri in the decomposition so that no attributes are lost; formally, we have\\nRRi\\nim\\n==\\n1U\\nThis is called the attribute preservation  condition of a decomposition.\\nAnother goal is to have each individual relation Ri in the decomposition D be in \\nBCNF or 3NF. However, this condition is not sufficient to guarantee a good data-base design on its own. We must consider the decomposition of the universal rela-tion as a whole, in addition to looking at the individual relations. To illustrate this point, consider the \\nEMP_LOCS(Ename, Plocation)  relation in Figure 14.5, which is in \\n3NF and also in BCNF. In fact, any relation schema with only two attributes is auto-matically in BCNF.\\n6 Although EMP_LOCS  is in BCNF, it still gives rise to spurious \\ntuples when joined with EMP_PROJ (Ssn, Pnumber, Hours, Pname, Plocation) , which is \\nnot in BCNF (see the partial result of the natural join in Figure 14.6). Hence,  \\nEMP_LOCS  represents a particularly bad relation schema because of its convoluted \\n6As an exercise, the reader should prove that this statement is true.'),\n",

Joining EMP_LOCS  with PROJECT(Pname, Pnumber, Plocation, \\nDnum)  in Figure 14.2—which is in BCNF—using Plocation  as a joining attribute also \\ngives rise to spurious tuples. This underscores the need for other criteria that, together with the conditions of 3NF or BCNF, prevent such bad designs. In the next three subsections we discuss such additional conditions that should hold on a decomposition D as a whole.\\n15.2.2  Dependency Preservation Property  \\nof a Decomposition\\nIt would be useful if each functional dependency X → Y specified in F either \\nappeared directly in one of the relation schemas Ri in the decomposition D or \\ncould be inferred from the dependencies that appear in some Ri. Informally, this \\nis the dependency preservation condition.  We want to preserve the dependencies \\nbecause each dependency in F represents a constraint on the database. If one of \\nthe dependencies is not represented in some individual relation Ri of the decom-\\nposition, we cannot enforce this constraint by dealing with an individual relation. \\nWe may have to join multiple relations so as to include all attributes involved in \\nthat dependency.\\nIt is not necessary that the exact dependencies specified in F appear themselves in \\nindividual relations of the decomposition D. It is sufficient that the union of the \\ndependencies that hold on the individual relations in D be equivalent to F. We now \\ndefine these concepts more formally.\\nDefinition. Given a set of dependencies F on R, the projection  of F on Ri, \\ndenoted by πRi(F) where Ri is a subset of R, is the set of dependencies X → Y in \\nF+ such that the attributes in X ∪ Y are all contained in Ri. Hence, the projection \\nof F on each relation schema Ri in the decomposition D is the set of functional \\ndependencies in F+, the closure of F, such that all the left- and right-hand-side \\nattributes of those dependencies are in Ri. We say that a decomposition  \\nD = {R1, R2, … , Rm} of R is dependency-preserving  with respect to F if the \\nunion of the projections of F on each Ri in D is equivalent to F; that is, \\n((πR1(F)) ∪ K ∪ (πRm(F)))+ = F+.\\nIf a decomposition is not dependency-preserving, some dependency is lost in \\nthe decomposition. To check that a lost dependency holds, we must take the JOIN of two or more relations in the decomposition to get a relation that includes all left- and right-hand-side attributes of the lost dependency, and then check that the dependency holds on the result of the JOIN—an option that is not practical.\\nAn example of a decomposition that does not preserve dependencies is shown in \\nFigure 14.13(a), in which the functional dependency FD2 is lost when \\nLOTS1A  is \\ndecomposed into {LOTS1AX, LOTS1AY} . The decompositions in Figure 14.12, how-\\never, are dependency-preserving. Similarly, for the example in Figure 14.14, no'),\n",

We now state a claim related to this property without providing any proof.\\nClaim 1. It is always possible to find a dependency-preserving decomposition \\nD with respect to F such that each relation R\\ni in D is in 3NF.\\n15.2.3  Nonadditive (Lossless) Join Property  \\nof a Decomposition\\nAnother property that a decomposition D should possess is the nonadditive join \\nproperty, which ensures that no spurious tuples are generated when a NATURAL \\nJOIN  operation is applied to the relations resulting from the decomposition. We \\nalready illustrated this problem in Section 14.1.4 with the example in Fig- ures 14.5 and 14.6. Because this is a property of a decomposition of relation  schemas,  the condition of no spurious tuples should hold on every legal relation \\nstate— that is, every relation state that satisfies the functional dependencies in F. \\nHence, the lossless join property is always defined with respect to a specific set F \\nof dependencies.\\nDefinition. Formally, a decomposition D = { R\\n1, R2, … , Rm} of R has the  \\nlossless (nonadditive) join property  with respect to the set of dependencies  \\nF on R if, for every  relation state r of R that satisfies F, the following holds,  \\nwhere * is the NATURAL JOIN  of all the relations in D: *(πR1(r), … , π Rm(r)) = r.\\nThe word loss in lossless  refers to loss of information , not to loss of tuples. If a \\ndecomposition does not have the lossless join property, we may get additional spu-rious tuples after the \\nPROJECT  (π) and NATURAL JOIN  (*) operations are applied; \\nthese additional tuples represent erroneous or invalid information. We prefer the \\nterm nonadditive join  because it describes the situation more accurately. Although \\nthe term lossless join  has been popular in the literature, we used the term nonaddi-\\ntive join  in describing the NJB property in Section 14.5.1. We will henceforth use the \\nterm nonadditive join , which is self-explanatory and unambiguous. The nonaddi-\\ntive join property ensures that no spurious tuples result after the application of \\nPROJECT  and JOIN  operations. We may, however, sometimes use the term lossy \\ndesign  to refer to a design that represents a loss of information. The decomposition \\nof EMP_PROJ(Ssn, Pnumber, Hours, Ename, Pname, Plocation)  in Figure 14.3 into  \\nEMP_LOCS(Ename, Plocation)  and EMP_PROJ1(Ssn, Pnumber, Hours, Pname, Plocation)  \\nin Figure 14.5 obviously does not have the nonadditive join property, as illustrated \\nby the partial result of NATURAL JOIN in Figure 14.6.

The first algorithm decomposes a universal relation into dependency- preserving 3NF relations that also possess the nonadditive join property. The second algorithm decomposes a universal relation schema into BCNF schemas that possess the nonadditive join property. It is not possible to design an algorithm to produce BCNF relations that satisfy both dependency preservation and nonadditive join decomposition\\n15.3.1  Dependency-Preserving and Nonadditive (Lossless)  \\nJoin Decomposition into 3NF Schemas\\nBy now we know that it is not possible to have all three of the following : (1) guaran-\\nteed nonlossy (nonadditive) design, (2) guaranteed dependency preservation, and (3) all relations in BCNF . As we have stressed repeatedly, the first condition is a \\nmust and cannot be compromised. The second condition is desirable, but not a must, and may have to be relaxed if we insist on achieving BCNF. The original lost FDs can be recovered by a JOIN operation over the results of decomposition. Now we give an algorithm where we achieve conditions 1 and 2 and only guarantee 3NF. Algorithm 15.4 yields a decomposition D of R that does the following:\\n ■Preserves dependencies\\n ■Has the nonadditive join property\\n ■Is such that each resulting relation schema in the decomposition is in 3NF\\nAlgorithm 15.4 Relational Synthesis into 3NF with Dependency Preservation \\nand Nonadditive Join Property\\nInput:  A universal relation R and a set of functional dependencies F on the \\nattributes of R.\\n  1.

For each left-hand-side X of a functional dependency that appears in G, create \\na relation schema in D with attributes { X ∪ {A1} ∪ {A2} … ∪ {Ak} }, where \\nX → A1, X → A2, … , X → Ak are the only dependencies in G with X as left-\\nhand side ( X is the key of this relation).\\n  3. If none of the relation schemas in D contains a key of R, then create one \\nmore relation schema in D that contains attributes that form a key of R. \\n(Algorithm 15.2(a) may be used to find a key.)\\n  4.

Algorithm 15.2(a) can be \\nused to identify a key K of R based on the set of given functional dependencies F. \\nNotice that the set of functional dependencies used to determine a key in Algo-rithm 15.2(a) could be either F or G, since they are equivalent.\\nExample 1 of Algorithm 15.4. Consider the following universal relation:\\nU\\n (Emp_ssn, Pno, Esal, Ephone, Dno, Pname, Plocation)\\nEmp_ssn , Esal, and Ephone  refer to the Social Security number, salary, and phone \\nnumber of the employee. Pno, Pname , and Plocation  refer to the number, name, and \\nlocation of the project. Dno is the department number.\\nThe following dependencies are present:\\nFD1: Emp_ssn  → {Esal , Ephone , Dno}\\nFD2: Pno → { Pname , Plocation}\\nFD3: Emp_ssn , Pno → {Esal, Ephone , Dno, Pname , Plocation}\\nBy virtue of FD3, the attribute set { Emp_ssn , Pno} represents a key of the universal \\nrelation. Hence F, the set of given FDs, includes { Emp_ssn  → Esal, Ephone , Dno; \\nPno → Pname , Plocation ; Emp_ssn , Pno → Esal, Ephone , Dno, Pname , Plocation }.\\nBy applying the minimal cover Algorithm 15.2, in step 3 we see that Pno is an extra-\\nneous attribute in Emp_ssn , Pno → Esal, Ephone , Dno. Moreover, Emp_ssn  is extrane-\\nous in Emp_ssn , Pno → Pname , Plocation . Hence the minimal cover consists of FD1 \\nand FD2 only (FD3 being completely redundant) as follows (if we group attributes \\nwith the same left-hand side into one FD):\\nMinimal cover G: {Emp_ssn  → Esal, Ephone, Dno;  Pno → Pname, Plocation}\\nThe second step of Algorithm 15.4 produces relations R1 and R2 as:\\nR1 (Emp_ssn, Esal, Ephone , Dno)\\nR2 (Pno, Pname , Plocation )\\nIn step 3, we generate a relation corresponding to the key { Emp_ssn , Pno} of U. \\nHence, the resulting design contains:\\nR1 (Emp_ssn, Esal, Ephone , Dno)\\nR2 (Pno, Pname , Plocation )\\nR3 (Emp_ssn , Pno)\\nThis design achieves both the desirable properties of dependency preservation and \\nnonadditive join.\\nExample 2 of Algorithm 15.4 (Case X).

If we apply the \\nminimal cover Algorithm 15.2 to F, (in step 2) we first represent the set F as\\nF: {P → L, P → C, P → A, LC  → A, LC  → P, A → C}\\nIn the set F, P → A can be inferred from P → LC and LC → A; hence P → A by tran-\\nsitivity and is therefore redundant. Thus, one possible minimal cover is\\nMinimal cover GX: {P → LC, LC  → AP, A  → C}\\nIn step 2 of Algorithm 15.4, we produce design X (before removing redundant rela-\\ntions) using the above minimal cover as\\nDesign X: R1 (P, L, C),  R2 (L, C, A, P), and  R3 (A, C)\\nIn step 4 of the algorithm, we find that R3 is subsumed by R2 (that is, R3 is always a \\nprojection of R2 and R1 is a projection of R2 as well). Hence both of those relations \\nare redundant. Thus the 3NF schema that achieves both of the desirable properties is (after removing redundant relations)\\nDesign X: R\\n2 (L, C, A, P).\\nor, in other words it is identical to the relation LOTS1A  (Property_id, Lot# , County , \\nArea) that we had determined to be in 3NF in Section 14.4.2.\\nExample 2 of Algorithm 15.4 (Case Y). Starting with LOTS1A  as the universal \\nrelation and with the same given set of functional dependencies, the second step of the minimal cover Algorithm 15.2 produces, as before,\\nF\\n: {P → C, P → A, P → L, LC  → A, LC  → P, A → C}\\nThe FD LC → A may be considered redundant because LC → P and P → A implies  \\nLC → A by transitivity.

We illustrated the application of this algorithm to the TEACH  relation \\nschema from Figure 14.14; it is decomposed into TEACH1(Instructor , Student ) \\nand TEACH2(Instructor , Course)  because the dependency FD2 Instructor  → Course  \\nviolates BCNF.\\nIn step 2 of Algorithm 15.5, it is necessary to determine whether a relation schema \\nQ is in BCNF or not. One method for doing this is to test, for each functional depen-\\ndency X → Y in Q, whether X+ fails to include all the attributes in Q, thereby deter-\\nmining whether or not X is a (super) key in Q. Another technique is based on an \\nobservation that whenever a relation schema Q has a BCNF violation, there exists a \\npair of attributes A and B in Q such that { Q − {A, B} } → A; by computing the clo-\\nsure { Q − {A, B} }+ for each pair of attributes { A, B} of Q and checking whether the \\nclosure includes A (or B), we can determine whether Q is in BCNF.\\nIt is important to note that the theory of nonadditive join decompositions is based \\non the assumption that no NULL values are allowed for the join attributes.  The next \\nsection discusses some of the problems that NULL s may cause in relational decom-\\npositions and provides a general discussion of the algorithms for relational design \\nby synthesis presented in this section.\\n15.4  About Nulls, Dangling Tuples, and \\nAlternative Relational Designs\\nIn this section, we discuss a few general issues related to problems that arise when \\nrelational design is not approached properly.\\n15.4.1 Problems with NULL Values and Dangling Tuples\\nWe must carefully consider the problems associated with NULL s when designing a \\nrelational database schema. There is no fully satisfactory relational design theory as \\nyet that includes NULL  values. One problem occurs when some tuples have NULL  \\nvalues for attributes that will be used to join individual relations in the decomposi-\\ntion. To illustrate this, consider the database shown in Figure 15.2(a), where two \\nrelations EMPLOYEE  and DEPARTMENT  are shown. The last two employee tuples—\\n‘Berger’ and ‘Benitez’—represent newly hired employees who have not yet been assigned to a department (assume that this does not violate any integrity con-straints). Now suppose that we want to retrieve a list of (\\nEname , Dname ) values for \\nall the employees. If we apply the NATURAL JOIN  operation on EMPLOYEE  and \\nDEPARTMENT  (Figure 15.2(b)), the two aforementioned tuples will not appear in \\nthe result. The OUTER JOIN  operation, discussed in Chapter 8, can deal with this \\nproblem. Recall that if we take the LEFT OUTER JOIN  of EMPLOYEE  with DEPARTMENT , \\ntuples in EMPLOYEE  that have NULL  for the join attribute will still appear in the \\nresult, joined with an imaginary  tuple in DEPARTMENT  that has NULL s for all its \\nattribute values. Figure 15.2(c) shows the result.\\nIn general, whenever a relational database schema is designed in which two or \\nmore relations are interrelated via foreign keys, particular care must be devoted to'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 554}, page_content='524 Chapter 15 Relational Database Design Algorithms and Further Dependencies\\nwatching for potential NULL  values in foreign keys. This can cause unexpected loss \\nof information in queries that involve joins on that foreign key. Moreover, if NULL s \\noccur in other attributes, such as Salary , their effect on built-in functions such as \\nSUM  and AVERAGE  must be carefully evaluated.\\nA related problem is that of dangling tuples , which may occur if we carry a decom-\\nposition too far. Suppose that we decompose the EMPLOYEE  relation in Fig- \\nure 15.2(a) further into EMPLOYEE_1  and EMPLOYEE_2 , shown in Figures 15.3(a) \\nand 15.3(b). If we apply the NATURAL JOIN  operation to EMPLOYEE_1  and EMPLOYEE_2 , \\nwe get the original EMPLOYEE  relation. However, we may use the alternative repre-\\nsentation, shown in Figure 15.3(c), where we do not include a tuple  in EMPLOYEE_3  \\nif the employee has not been assigned a department (instead of including a tuple with \\nNULL  for Dnum  as in EMPLOYEE_2 ). If we use EMPLOYEE_3  instead of \\nEMPLOYEE_2  and apply a NATURAL JOIN  on EMPLOYEE_1  and EMPLOYEE_3 , the \\ntuples for Berger and Benitez will not appear in the result; these are called dangling \\ntuples  in EMPLOYEE_1  because they are represented in only one of the two rela-\\ntions that represent employees, and hence they are lost if we apply an ( INNER ) \\nJOIN  operation.\\n15.4.2  Discussion of Normalization Algorithms  \\nand Alternative Relational Designs\\nOne of the problems with the normalization algorithms we described is that the \\ndatabase designer must first specify all the relevant functional dependencies among \\nthe database attributes. This is not a simple task for a large database with hundreds \\nof attributes. Failure to specify one or two important dependencies may result in an undesirable design. Another problem is that these algorithms are not deterministic  \\nin general. For example, the synthesis algorithms  (Algorithms 15.4 and 15.5) require \\nthe specification of a minimal cover G for the set of functional dependencies F. \\nBecause there may be, in general, many minimal covers corresponding to F, as we \\nillustrated in Example 2 of Algorithm 15.4 above, the algorithm can give different \\ndesigns depending on the particular minimal cover used. Some of these designs may not be desirable. The decomposition algorithm to achieve BCNF (Algo- rithm 15.5) depends on the order in which the functional dependencies are supplied \\nto the algorithm to check for BCNF violation. Again, it is possible that many different designs may arise. Some of the designs may be preferred, whereas others may be undesirable.\\nIt is not always possible to find a decomposition into relation schemas that pre-\\nserves dependencies and allows each relation schema in the decomposition to be in BCNF (instead of 3NF, as in Algorithm 15.4). We can check the 3NF relation schemas in the decomposition individually to see whether each satisfies BCNF.

A relation schema R is in 4 NF with respect to a set of dependencies F \\n(that includes functional dependencies and multivalued dependencies) if, for every \\nnontrivial  multivalued dependency X →→ Y in F+, X in F+, X is a superkey for R.\\nTo illustrate the importance of 4NF, Figure 15.4(a) shows the EMP  relation in Fig-\\nure 14.15 with an additional employee, ‘Brown’, who has three dependents (‘Jim’, ‘Joan’, and ‘Bob’) and works on four different projects (‘W’, ‘X’, ‘Y’, and ‘Z’). There are 16 tuples in \\nEMP  in Figure 15.4(a). If we decompose EMP  into EMP_PROJECTS  \\nand EMP_DEPENDENTS , as shown in Figure 15.4(b), we need to store a total of \\nonly 11 tuples in both relations. Not only would the decomposition save on stor-\\nage, but the update anomalies associated with multivalued dependencies would \\nalso be avoided. For example, if ‘Brown’ starts working on a new additional project \\n‘P’, we must insert three  tuples in EMP —one for each dependent.

If the update is handled incorrectly, the meaning of the relation may change. However, after normalization into 4NF, these update anomalies disappear. For example, to add the information that ‘Brown’ will be assigned to project ‘P’, only a single tuple need be inserted in the 4NF relation \\nEMP _PROJECTS .\\nThe EMP  relation in Figure 14.15(a) is not in 4NF because it represents two inde-\\npendent  1:N relationships—one between employees and the projects they work on \\nand the other between employees and their dependents.

It can be shown that this is a necessary and sufficient condition for decomposing a schema into two schemas that have the nonadditive join property, as given by Property NJB ′ that is a further generalization of Property NJB given \\nearlier in Section 14.5.1.

It arises when a relation is decomposable into a set of projected rela-tions that can be joined back to yield the original relation. After defining JD, we defined the fifth normal form based on it in Section 14.7. Fifth normal form has also been known as project join normal form or PJNF (Fagin, 1979). A practical problem with this and some additional dependencies (and related normal forms such as DKNF, which is defined in Section 15.6.3) is that they are difficult to discover.'),\n",

In the remaining part of this section, we introduce some other types of dependencies that have been identified. Among them, the inclusion dependencies and those based on arithmetic or similar functions are used frequently.\\n15.6.2 Inclusion Dependencies\\nInclusion dependencies were defined in order to formalize two types of interrela-tional constraints:\\n ■The foreign key (or referential integrity) constraint cannot be specified as a \\nfunctional or multivalued dependency because it relates attributes across relations.\\n ■The constraint between two relations that represent a class/subclass rela-\\ntionship (see Chapters 4 and 9) also has no formal definition in terms of the functional, multivalued, and join dependencies.\\nDefinition. An inclusion dependency  R.X < S.Y between two sets of attri-\\nbutes— X of relation schema R, and Y of relation schema S—specifies the con-\\nstraint that, at any specific time when r is a relation state of R and s is a relation \\nstate of S, we must have\\nπ\\nX(r(R)) ⊆ πY(s(S))\\nThe ⊆ (subset) relationship does not necessarily have to be a proper subset. Obviously, \\nthe sets of attributes on which the inclusion dependency is specified— X of R and Y of \\nS—must have the same number of attributes. In addition, the domains for each pair of \\ncorresponding attributes should be compatible. For example, if X = {A1, A2, … , An} \\nand Y = {B1, B2, … , Bn}, one possible correspondence is to have dom( Ai) compatible \\nwith dom( Bi) for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. In this case, we say that Ai corresponds to  Bi.\\nFor example, we can specify the following inclusion dependencies on the relational \\nschema in Figure 14.1:\\nDEPARTMENT.Dmgr_ssn < EMPLOYEE.Ssn\\nWORKS_ON.Ssn < EMPLOYEE.SsnEMPLOYEE.Dnumber < DEPARTMENT.DnumberPROJECT.Dnum < DEPARTMENT.DnumberWORKS_ON.Pnumber < PROJECT.PnumberDEPT_LOCATIONS.Dnumber < DEPARTMENT.Dnumber\\nAll the preceding inclusion dependencies represent referential integrity  \\nconstraints . We can also use inclusion dependencies to represent class/subclass \\nrelationships . For example, in the relational schema of Figure 9.6, we can specify \\nthe following inclusion dependencies:\\nEMPLOYEE.Ssn < PERSON.Ssn\\nALUMNUS.Ssn < PERSON.SsnSTUDENT.Ssn < PERSON.Ssn'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 562}, page_content='532 Chapter 15 Relational Database Design Algorithms and Further Dependencies\\nAs with other types of dependencies, there are inclusion dependency inference rules  \\n(IDIRs). The following are three examples:\\nIDIR1  (reflexivity): R.X < R.X.\\nIDIR2  (attribute correspondence): If R.X < S.Y, where X = {A1, A2, … , An} and \\nY = {B1, B2, … , Bn} and Ai corresponds to B i, then R.Ai < S.Bi for 1 ≤ i ≤ n.\\nIDIR3  (transitivity): If R.X < S.Y and S.Y < T.Z, then R.X < T.Z.\\nThe preceding inference rules were shown to be sound and complete for inclusion \\ndependencies. So far, no normal forms have been developed based on inclusion dependencies.\\n15.6.3  Functional Dependencies Based on Arithmetic  \\nFunctions and Procedures\\nSometimes some attributes in a relation may be related via some arithmetic func-\\ntion or a more complicated functional relationship. As long as a unique value of Y \\nis associated with every X, we can still consider that the FD X → Y exists. For exam-\\nple, in the relation\\nORDER_LINE (Order#, Item#, Quantity, Unit_price, Extended_price,  \\nDiscounted_price)\\neach tuple represents an item from an order with a particular quantity, and the \\nprice per unit for that item. In this relation, ( Quantity , Unit_price  ) → Extended_price  \\nby the formula\\nExtended_price = Unit_price  * Quantity\\nHence, there is a unique value for Extended_price  for every pair ( Quantity , Unit_price ), \\nand thus it conforms to the definition of functional dependency.\\nMoreover, there may be a procedure that takes into account the quantity discounts, \\nthe type of item, and so on and computes a discounted price for the total quantity ordered for that item. Therefore, we can say\\n(Item#, Quantity, Unit_price )  → Discounted_price , or\\n(Item#, Quantity, Extended_price)  → Discounted_price\\nTo check the above FDs, a more complex procedure COMPUTE_TOTAL_PRICE  may \\nhave to be called into play. Although the above kinds of FDs are technically present \\nin most relations, they are not given particular attention during normalization. They \\nmay be relevant during the loading of relations and during query processing because \\npopulating or retrieving the attribute on the right-hand side of the dependency requires the execution of a procedure such as the one mentioned above.\\n15.6.4 Domain-Key Normal Form\\nThere is no hard-and-fast rule about defining normal forms only up to 5NF.

The idea behind domain-key normal form  (DKNF ) is to specify (theoreti-\\ncally, at least) the ultimate normal form  that takes into account all possible types of \\ndependencies and constraints. A relation schema is said to be in DKNF  if all con-\\nstraints and dependencies that should hold on the valid relation states can be enforced simply by enforcing the domain constraints and key constraints on the relation. For a relation in DKNF, it becomes straightforward to enforce all database constraints by simply checking that each attribute value in a tuple is of the appro-priate domain and that every key constraint is enforced.\\nHowever, because of the difficulty of including complex constraints in a DKNF \\nrelation, its practical utility is limited, since it may be quite difficult to specify gen-eral integrity constraints. For example, consider a relation \\nCAR(Make, Vin#)  (where \\nVin#  is the vehicle identification number) and another relation MANUFACTURE(Vin#, \\nCountry)  (where Country  is the country of manufacture). A general constraint may be \\nof the following form: If the Make is either ‘Toyota’ or ‘Lexus’, then the first character \\nof the Vin# is a ‘J’ if the country of manufacture is ‘Japan’; if the Make is ‘Honda’ or \\n‘Acura’, the second character of the Vin# is a ‘J’ if the country of manufacture is \\n‘Japan’.  There is no simplified way to represent such constraints short of writing a \\nprocedure (or general assertions) to test them. The procedure COMPUTE_TOTAL_PRICE  \\nabove is an example of such procedures needed to enforce an appropriate integrity \\nconstraint.\\nFor these reasons, although the concept of DKNF is appealing and appears straight-\\nforward, it cannot be directly tested or implemented with any guarantees of consis-\\ntency or non-redundancy of design. Hence it is not used much in practice.\\n15.7 Summary\\nIn this chapter we presented a further set of topics related to dependencies, a dis-\\ncussion of decomposition, and several algorithms related to them as well as to the \\nprocess of designing 3NF, BCNF, and 4NF relations from a given set of functional \\ndependencies and multivalued dependencies. In Section 15.1 we presented infer-ence rules for functional dependencies (FDs), the notion of closure of an attribute, the notion of closure of a set of functional dependencies, equivalence among sets of functional dependencies, and algorithms for finding the closure of an attribute (Algorithm 15.1) and the minimal cover of a set of FDs (Algorithm 15.2). We then discussed two important properties of decompositions: the nonadditive join prop-erty and the dependency-preserving property. An algorithm to test for an n-way \\nnonadditive decomposition of a relation (Algorithm 15.3) was presented. A sim-pler test for checking for nonadditive binary decompositions (property NJB) has already been described in Section 14.5.1. We then discussed relational design by synthesis, based on a set of given functional dependencies. The relational synthesis \\nalgorithm  (Algorithm 15.4) creates 3NF relations from a universal relation \\nschema based on a given set of functional dependencies that has been specified by'),\n",

The relational decomposition algorithms  (such as Algo-\\nrithms 15.5 and 15.6) create BCNF (or 4NF) relations by successive nonadditive decomposition of unnormalized relations into two component relations at a time. We saw that it is possible to synthesize 3NF relation schemas that meet both of the above properties; however, in the case of BCNF, it is possible to aim only for the nonadditiveness of joins—dependency preservation cannot  be necessarily guaran-\\nteed. If the designer has to aim for one of these two, the nonadditive join condition is an absolute must. In Section 15.4 we showed how certain difficulties arise in a collection of relations due to null values that may exist in relations in spite of the relations being individually in 3NF or BCNF. Sometimes when decomposition is improperly carried too far, certain “dangling tuples” may result that do not par-ticipate in results of joins and hence may become invisible. We also showed how algorithms such as 15.4 for 3NF synthesis could lead to alternative designs based on the choice of minimum cover. We revisited multivalued dependencies (MVDs) in Section 15.5. MVDs arise from an improper combination of two or more inde-pendent multivalued attributes in the same relation, and MVDs result in a combi-national expansion of the tuples used to define fourth normal form (4NF). We discussed inference rules applicable to MVDs and discussed the importance of 4NF. Finally, in Section 15.6 we discussed inclusion dependencies, which are used to specify referential integrity and class/subclass constraints, and pointed out the need for arithmetic functions or more complex procedures to enforce certain functional dependency constraints. We concluded with a brief discussion of the domain-key normal form (DKNF).\\nReview Questions\\n 15.1.

The DBMS software can then retrieve, \\nupdate, and process this data as needed. Computer storage media form a storage \\nhierarchy  that includes two main categories:\\n ■Primary storage.  This category includes storage media that can be operated \\non directly by the computer’s central processing unit  (CPU), such as the \\ncomputer’s main memory and smaller but faster cache memories. Primary \\nstorage usually provides fast access to data but is of limited storage capacity. \\nAlthough main memory capacities have been growing rapidly in recent years, they are still more expensive and have less storage capacity than demanded by typical enterprise-level databases. The contents of main mem-ory are lost in case of power failure or a system crash.\\n ■Secondary storage.  The primary choice of storage medium for online stor-\\nage of enterprise databases has been magnetic disks. However, flash memo-ries are becoming a common medium of choice for storing moderate amounts of permanent data. When used as a substitute for a disk drive, such memory is called a solid-state drive  (SSD).\\n ■Tertiary storage.  Optical disks (CD-ROMs, DVDs, and other similar stor-\\nage media) and tapes are removable media used in today’s systems as offline \\nstorage for archiving databases and hence come under the category called \\ntertiary storage. These devices usually have a larger capacity, cost less, and \\nprovide slower access to data than do primary storage devices. Data in sec-\\nondary or tertiary storage cannot be processed directly by the CPU; first it must be copied into primary storage and then processed by the CPU.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 573}, page_content='16.1 Introduction  543\\nWe first give an overview of the various storage devices used for primary, second-\\nary, and tertiary storage in Section 16.1.1, and in Section 16.1.2 we discuss how databases are typically handled in the storage hierarchy.\\n16.1.1 Memory Hierarchies and Storage Devices1\\nIn a modern computer system, data resides and is transported throughout a hierar-chy of storage media. The highest-speed memory is the most expensive and is therefore available with the least capacity. The lowest-speed memory is offline tape storage, which is essentially available in indefinite storage capacity.\\nAt the primary storage level,  the memory hierarchy includes, at the most expensive \\nend, cache memory , which is a static RAM (random access memory). Cache mem-\\nory is typically used by the CPU to speed up execution of program instructions using techniques such as prefetching and pipelining. The next level of primary stor-age is DRAM (dynamic RAM), which provides the main work area for the CPU for keeping program instructions and data. It is popularly called main memory . The \\nadvantage of DRAM is its low cost, which continues to decrease; the drawback is its volatility\\n2 and lower speed compared with static RAM.\\nAt the secondary and tertiary storage level,  the hierarchy includes magnetic disks; \\nmass storage  in the form of CD-ROM (compact disk–read-only memory) and \\nDVD (digital video disk or digital versatile disk) devices; and finally tapes at the least expensive end of the hierarchy. The storage capacity  is measured in kilobytes \\n(Kbyte or 1,000 bytes), megabytes (MB or 1 million bytes), gigabytes (GB or 1 bil-lion bytes), and even terabytes (1,000 GB). The word petabyte  (1,000 terabytes or \\n10**15 bytes) is now becoming relevant in the context of very large repositories of data in physics, astronomy, earth sciences, and other scientific applications.\\nPrograms reside and execute in dynamic random-access memory ( DRAM ). Gen-\\nerally, large permanent databases reside on secondary storage (magnetic disks), and portions of the database are read into and written from buffers in main memory as needed. Nowadays, personal computers and workstations have large main memo-ries of hundreds of megabytes of RAM and DRAM, so it is becoming possible to load a large part of the database into main memory. Eight to sixteen GB of main memory is becoming commonplace on laptops, and servers with 256 GB capacity are not uncommon. In some cases, entire databases can be kept in main memory (with a backup copy on magnetic disk), which results in main memory databases ; \\nthese are particularly useful in real-time applications that require extremely fast response times. An example is telephone switching applications, which store data-bases that contain routing and line information in main memory.\\nFlash Memory. Between DRAM and magnetic disk storage, another form of \\nmemory, flash memory , is becoming common, particularly because it is nonvolatile. \\n2Volatile memory typically loses its contents in case of a power outage, whereas nonvolatile memory \\ndoes not.1The authors appreciate the valuable input of Dan Forsyth regarding the current status of storage \\nsystems in enterprises. The authors also wish to thank Satish Damle for his suggestions.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 574}, page_content='544 Chapter 16 Disk Storage, Basic File Structures, Hashing, and Modern Storage Architectures\\nFlash memories are high-density, high-performance memories using EEPROM \\n(electrically erasable programmable read-only memory) technology. The advantage of flash memory is the fast access speed; the disadvantage is that an entire block must be erased and written over simultaneously. Flash memories come in two types called NAND and NOR flash based on the type of logic circuits used. The NAND flash devices have a higher storage capacity for a given cost and are used as the data storage medium in appliances with capacities ranging from 8 GB to 64 GB for the popular cards that cost less than a dollar per GB. Flash devices are used in cameras, MP3/MP4 players, cell phones, PDAs (personal digital assistants), and so on. USB (universal serial bus) flash drives or USB sticks have become the most portable medium for carrying data between personal computers; they have a flash memory storage device integrated with a USB interface.\\nOptical Drives. The most popular form of optical removable storage is CDs (com-\\npact disks) and DVDs. CDs have a 700-MB capacity whereas DVDs have capacities ranging from 4.5 to 15 GB. CD-ROM(compact disk – read only memory) disks store data optically and are read by a laser. CD-ROMs contain prerecorded data that cannot be overwritten. The version of compact and digital video disks called CD-R (compact disk recordable) and DVD-R or DVD +R, which are also known as \\nWORM (write-once-read-many) disks, are a form of optical storage used for archiving data; they allow data to be written once and read any number of times without the possibility of erasing. They hold about half a gigabyte of data per disk \\nand last much longer than magnetic disks.\\n3 A higher capacity format for DVDs \\ncalled Blu-ray DVD can store 27 GB per layer, or 54 GB in a two-layer disk. Optical \\njukebox memories  use an array of CD-ROM platters, which are loaded onto drives \\non demand. Although optical jukeboxes have capacities in the hundreds of giga-\\nbytes, their retrieval times are in the hundreds of milliseconds, quite a bit slower than magnetic disks. This type of tertiary  storage  is continuing to decline because \\nof the rapid decrease in cost and the increase in capacities of magnetic disks. Most \\npersonal computer disk drives now read CD-ROM and DVD disks. Typically, \\ndrives are CD-R (compact disk recordable) that can create CD-ROMs and audio \\nCDs, as well as record on DVDs.\\nMagnetic Tapes. Finally, magnetic tapes  are used for archiving and backup stor-\\nage of data. Tape jukeboxes —which contain a bank of tapes that are catalogued \\nand can be automatically loaded onto tape drives—are becoming popular as  tertiary \\nstorage  to hold terabytes of data. For example, NASA’s EOS (Earth Observation \\n Satellite) system stores archived databases in this fashion.\\nMany large organizations are using terabyte-sized databases. The term very large \\ndatabase  can no longer be precisely defined because disk storage capacities are on \\n3Their rotational speeds are lower (around 400 rpm), giving higher latency delays and low transfer \\nrates (around 100 to 200 KB/second) for a 1X drive. nX drives (e.g., 16X ( n = 16) are supposed to \\ngive n times higher transfer rate by multiplying the rpm n times. The 1X DVD transfer rate is about \\n1.385 MB/s.'),\n",

Soon the term very large database  may be reserved \\nfor databases containing hundreds of terabytes or petabytes.\\nTo summarize, a hierarchy of storage devices and storage systems is available today \\nfor storage of data. Depending upon the intended use and application requirements, data is kept in one or more levels of this hierarchy. Table 16.1 summarizes the cur-rent state of these devices and systems and shows the range of capacities, average access times, bandwidths (transfer speeds), and costs on the open commodity mar-ket. Cost of storage is generally going down at all levels of this hierarchy.\\n16.1.2 Storage Organization of Databases\\nDatabases typically store large amounts of data that must persist over long periods of time, and hence the data is often referred to as persistent data . Parts of this data \\nare accessed and processed repeatedly during the storage period. This contrasts \\nwith the notion of transient data , which persists for only a limited time during \\nprogram execution. Most databases are stored permanently (or persistently ) on \\nmagnetic disk secondary storage, for the following reasons:\\n ■Generally, databases are too large to fit entirely in main memory.4\\n ■The circumstances that cause permanent loss of stored data arise less fre-\\nquently for disk secondary storage than for primary storage. Hence, we refer to disk—and other secondary storage devices—as nonvolatile storage , \\nwhereas main memory is often called volatile storage .\\n ■The cost of storage per unit of data is an order of magnitude less for disk \\nsecondary storage than for primary storage.Table 16.1 T ypes of Storage with Capacity, Access Time, Max Bandwidth (Transfer Speed), and Commodity Cost\\n \\nType \\nCapacity*Access  \\nTime \\nMax BandwidthCommodity \\nPrices (2014)**\\nMain Memory- RAM 4GB–1TB 30ns 35GB/sec $100–$20K\\nFlash Memory- SSD 64 GB–1TB 50μs 750MB/sec $50–$600Flash Memory- USB stick 4GB–512GB 100μs 50MB/sec $2–$200Magnetic Disk 400 GB–8TB 10ms 200MB/sec $70–$500Optical Storage 50GB–100GB 180ms 72MB/sec $100Magnetic Tape 2.5TB–8.5TB 10s–80s 40–250MB/sec $2.5K–$30KTape jukebox 25TB–2,100,000TB 10s–80s 250MB/sec–1.2PB/sec $3K–$1M+\\n*Capacities are based on commercially available popular units in 2014.\\n**Costs are based on commodity online marketplaces.\\n4This statement is being challenged by recent developments in main memory database systems.  \\nExamles of prominent commercial systems include HANA by SAP and TIMESTEN by Oracle.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 576}, page_content='546 Chapter 16 Disk Storage, Basic File Structures, Hashing, and Modern Storage Architectures\\nSome of the newer technologies—such as solid-state drive (SSD) disks are likely to \\nprovide viable alternatives to the use of magnetic disks. In the future, databases may therefore reside at different levels of the memory hierarchy from those described in Section 16.1.1. The levels may range from the highest speed main memory level storage to the tape jukebox low speed offline storage. However, it is anticipated that magnetic disks will continue to be the primary medium of choice for large data-bases for years to come. Hence, it is important to study and understand the proper-ties and characteristics of magnetic disks and the way data files can be organized on disk in order to design effective databases with acceptable performance.\\nMagnetic tapes are frequently used as a storage medium for backing up databases \\nbecause storage on tape costs much less than storage on disk. With some interven-tion by an operator—or an automatic loading device—tapes or optical removable disks must be loaded and read before the data becomes available for processing. In contrast, disks are online  devices that can be accessed directly at any time.\\nThe techniques used to store large amounts of structured data on disk are impor-\\ntant for database designers, the DBA, and implementers of a DBMS. Database designers and the DBA must know the advantages and disadvantages of each stor-age technique when they design, implement, and operate a database on a specific DBMS. Usually, the DBMS has several options available for organizing the data. The process of physical database design  involves choosing the particular data \\norganization techniques that best suit the given application requirements from among the options. DBMS system implementers must study data organization techniques so that they can implement them efficiently and thus provide the DBA and users of the DBMS with sufficient options.\\nTypical database applications need only a small portion of the database at a time for \\nprocessing. Whenever a certain portion of the data is needed, it must be located on disk, copied to main memory for processing, and then rewritten to the disk if the data is changed. The data stored on disk is organized as files  of records . Each record \\nis a collection of data values that can be interpreted as facts about entities, their attributes, and their relationships. Records should be stored on disk in a manner that makes it possible to locate them efficiently when they are needed. We will dis-cuss some of the techniques for making disk access more efficient in Section 17.2.2.\\nThere are several primary file organizations , which determine how the file \\nrecords are physically placed  on the disk, and hence how the records can be accessed.  \\nA heap file  (or unordered file ) places the records on disk in no particular order by \\nappending new records at the end of the file, whereas a sorted file  (or sequential \\nfile) keeps the records ordered by the value of a particular field (called the sort key ). \\nA hashed file  uses a hash function applied to a particular field (called the hash key ) \\nto determine a record’s placement on disk. Other primary file organizations, such as B-trees,  use tree structures. We discuss primary file organizations in Sec-\\ntions\\xa016.6 through 16.9. A secondary organization  or auxiliary access structure  \\nallows efficient access to file records based on alternate fields  than those that have \\nbeen used for the primary file organization. Most of these exist as indexes and will \\nbe discussed in Chapter 17.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 577}, page_content='16.2 Secondary Storage Devices  547\\n16.2 Secondary Storage Devices\\nIn this section, we describe some characteristics of magnetic disk and magnetic tape \\nstorage devices. Readers who have already studied these devices may simply browse through this section.\\n16.2.1 Hardware Description of Disk Devices\\nMagnetic disks are used for storing large amounts of data. The device that holds the disks is referred to as a hard disk drive , or HDD . The most basic unit of data on the \\ndisk is a single bit of information. By magnetizing an area on a disk in certain ways, \\none can make that area represent a bit value of either 0 (zero) or 1 (one). To code information, bits are grouped into bytes  (or characters ). Byte sizes are typically 4 to \\n8 bits, depending on the computer and the device; 8 bits is the most common. We assume that one character is stored in a single byte, and we use the terms byte and \\ncharacter  interchangeably. The capacity  of a disk is the number of bytes it can store, \\nwhich is usually very large. Small floppy disks were used with laptops and desk-tops for many years—they contained a single disk typically holding from 400 KB \\nto\\xa01.5 MB; they are almost completely out of circulation. Hard disks for personal computers currently hold from several hundred gigabytes up to a few terabytes; and large disk packs used with servers and mainframes have capacities of hundreds of gigabytes. Disk capacities continue to grow as technology improves.\\nWhatever their capacity, all disks are made of magnetic material shaped as a thin \\ncircular disk, as shown in Figure 16.1(a), and protected by a plastic or acrylic cover. A disk is single-sided  if it stores information on one of its surfaces only and double-\\nsided  if both surfaces are used. To increase storage capacity, disks are assembled \\ninto a disk pack , as shown in Figure 16.1(b), which may include many disks and \\ntherefore many surfaces. The two most common form factors are 3.5 and 2.5 inch diameter. Information is stored on a disk surface in concentric circles of small \\nwidth,\\n5 each having a distinct diameter. Each circle is called a track . In disk packs, \\ntracks with the same diameter on the various surfaces are called a cylinder  because \\nof the shape they would form if connected in space. The concept of a cylinder is important because data stored on one cylinder can be retrieved much faster than if it were distributed among different cylinders.\\nThe number of tracks on a disk ranges from a few thousand to 152,000 on the disk \\ndrives shown in Table 16.2, and the capacity of each track typically ranges from tens of kilobytes to 150 Kbytes. Because a track usually contains a large amount of infor-mation, it is divided into smaller blocks or sectors. The division of a track into  sectors  is hard-coded on the disk surface and cannot be changed.

A disk with hard-coded sectors often has the sectors subdi-\\nvided or combined into blocks during initialization. Blocks are separated by fixed-\\nsize interblock gaps , which include specially coded control information written \\nduring disk initialization. This information is used to determine which block on the track follows each interblock gap. Table 16.2 illustrates the specifications of typical disks used on large servers in industry. The 10K prefix on disk names refers to the rotational speeds in rpm (revolutions per minute.\\nThere is continuous improvement in the storage capacity and transfer rates associ-\\nated with disks; they are also progressively getting cheaper—currently costing only a fraction of a dollar per megabyte of disk storage. Costs are going down so rapidly that costs as low as $100/TB are already on the market.\\nA disk is a random access  addressable device. Transfer of data between main mem-\\nory and disk takes place in units of disk blocks. The hardware address  of a block—\\na combination of a cylinder number, track number (surface number within the cylinder on which the track is located), and block number (within the track)—is supplied to the disk I/O (input/output) hardware. In many modern disk drives, a single number called LBA (logical block address), which is a number between 0 and n (assuming the total capacity of the disk is n + 1 blocks), is mapped automatically \\nto the right block by the disk drive controller.

For a \\nread  command, the disk block is copied into the buffer; whereas for a write  com-\\nmand, the contents of the buffer are copied into the disk block. Sometimes several contiguous blocks, called a cluster , may be transferred as a unit. In this case, the \\nbuffer size is adjusted to match the number of bytes in the cluster.\\nThe actual hardware mechanism that reads or writes a block is the disk read/write \\nhead , which is part of a system called a disk drive . A disk or disk pack is mounted \\nin the disk drive, which includes a motor that rotates the disks. A read/write head includes an electronic component attached to a mechanical arm . Disk packs with \\nmultiple surfaces are controlled by several read/write heads—one for each surface, as shown in Figure 16.1(b). All arms are connected to an actuator  attached to \\nanother electrical motor, which moves the read/write heads in unison and positions them precisely over the cylinder of tracks specified in a block address.\\nDisk drives for hard disks rotate the disk pack continuously at a constant speed (typ-\\nically ranging between 5,400 and 15,000 rpm). Once the read/write head is posi-tioned on the right track and the block specified in the block address moves under the read/write head, the electronic component of the read/write head is activated to transfer the data. Some disk units have fixed read/write heads, with as many heads as there are tracks. These are called fixed-head  disks, whereas disk units with an actua-\\ntor are called movable-head disks . For fixed-head disks, a track or cylinder is \\nselected by electronically switching to the appropriate read/write head rather than by actual mechanical movement; consequently, it is much faster. However, the cost of the additional read/write heads is high, so fixed-head disks are not commonly used.\\nInterfacing Disk Drives to Computer Systems. A disk controller , typically \\nembedded in the disk drive, controls the disk drive and interfaces it to the computer system. One of the standard interfaces used for disk drives on PCs and workstations was called SCSI  (small computer system interface). Today to connect HDDs, CDs, and \\nDVDs to a computer, the interface of choice is SATA. SATA  stands for serial ATA, \\nwherein ATA represents attachment; so SATA becomes serial AT attachment. It has its origin in PC/AT attachment, which referred to the direct attachment to the 16-bit bus introduced by IBM. The AT referred to advanced technology but is not used in the expansion of SATA due to trademark issues. Another popular interface used today is called SAS (serial attached SCSI). SATA was introduced in 2002 and allows the disk \\ncontroller to be in the disk drive; only a simple circuit is required on the motherboard. SATA transfer speeds underwent an evolution from 2002 to 2008, going from 1.5\\xa0Gbps (gigabits per second) to 6 Gbps. SATA is now called NL-SAS for nearline SAS. The largest 3.5-inch SATA and SAS drives are 8TB, whereas 2.5-inch SAS drives are smaller and go up to 1.2TB. The 3.5-inch drives use 7,200 or 10,000 rpm speed whereas  2.5-inch drives use up to 15,000 rpm. In terms of IOPs (input/output operations) per second as a price to performance index, SAS is considered superior to SATA.\\nThe controller accepts high-level I/O commands and takes appropriate action to \\nposition the arm and causes the read/write action to take place. To transfer a disk block, given its address, the disk controller must first mechanically position the'),\n",

The time required to do this is called the seek \\ntime . Typical seek times are 5 to 10 msec on desktops and 3 to 8 msec on servers. \\nFollowing that, there is another delay—called the rotational delay  or latency —while \\nthe beginning of the desired block rotates into position under the read/write head. It depends on the rpm of the disk. For example, at 15,000 rpm, the time per rotation is 4 msec and the average rotational delay is the time per half revolution, or 2 msec. At 10,000 rpm the average rotational delay increases to 3 msec. Finally, some additional time is needed to transfer the data; this is called the block transfer time . Hence, the \\ntotal time needed to locate and transfer an arbitrary block, given its address, is the sum of the seek time, rotational delay, and block transfer time. The seek time and rotational delay are usually much larger than the block transfer time. To make the transfer of multiple blocks more efficient, it is common to transfer several consecu-tive blocks on the same track or cylinder. This eliminates the seek time and rota-tional delay for all but the first block and can result in a substantial saving of time when numerous contiguous blocks are transferred. Usually, the disk manufacturer provides a bulk transfer rate  for calculating the time required to transfer consecu-\\ntive blocks. Appendix B contains a discussion of these and other disk parameters.\\nThe time needed to locate and transfer a disk block is in the order of milliseconds, \\nusually ranging from 9 to 60 msec. For contiguous blocks, locating the first block takes from 9 to 60 msec, but transferring subsequent blocks may take only 0.4 to\\xa02\\xa0msec each. Many search techniques take advantage of consecutive retrieval of blocks when searching for data on a disk. In any case, a transfer time in the order of milliseconds is considered high compared with the time required to process data in main memory by current CPUs. Hence, locating data on disk is a major bottleneck  \\nin database applications. The file structures we discuss here and in Chapter 17 attempt to minimize the number of block transfers  needed to locate and transfer the \\nrequired data from disk to main memory. Placing “related information” on contig-uous blocks is the basic goal of any storage organization on disk.\\n16.2.2 Making Data Access More Efficient on Disk\\nIn this subsection, we list some of the commonly used techniques to make accessing data more efficient on HDDs.\\n  1. Buffering of data:  In order to deal with the incompatibility of speeds \\nbetween a CPU and the electromechanical device such as an HDD, which is inherently slower, buffering of data is done in memory so that new data can be held in a buffer while old data is processed by an application. We discuss the double buffering strategy followed by general issues of buffer manage-ment and buffer replacement strategies in Section 16.3.\\n  2. Proper organization of data on disk:  Given the structure and organization \\nof data on disk, it is advantageous to keep related data on contiguous blocks; \\nwhen multiple cylinders are needed by a relation, contiguous cylinders \\nshould be used. Doing so avoids unnecessary movement of the read/write \\narm and related seek times.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 583}, page_content='16.2 Secondary Storage Devices  553\\n  3. Reading data ahead of request:  To minimize seek times, whenever a block \\nis read into the buffer, blocks from the rest of the track can also be read even though they may not have been requested yet. This works well for applica-tions that are likely to need consecutive blocks; for random block reads this strategy is counterproductive.\\n  4. Proper scheduling of I/O requests:  If it is necessary to read several blocks \\nfrom disk, total access time can be minimized by scheduling them so that the arm moves only in one direction and picks up the blocks along its move-ment. One popular algorithm is called the elevator algorithm; this algorithm mimics the behavior of an elevator that schedules requests on multiple floors in a proper sequence. In this way, the arm can service requests along its out-ward and inward movements without much disruption.\\n  5. Use of log disks to temporarily hold writes:  A single disk may be assigned \\nto just one function called logging of writes. All blocks to be written can go to that disk sequentially, thus eliminating any seek time. This works much faster than doing the writes to a file at random locations, which requires a seek for each write. The log disk can order these writes in (cylinder, track) ordering to minimize arm movement when writing. Actually, the log disk can only be an area (extent) of a disk. Having the data file and the log file on the same disk is a cheaper solution but compromises performance. Although the idea of a log disk can improve write performance, it is not feasible for most real-life application data.\\n  6. Use of SSDs or flash memory for recovery purposes:  In applications \\nwhere updates occur with high frequency, updates can be lost from main \\nmemory if the system crashes. A preventive measure would be to increase \\nthe speed of updates/writes to disk. One possible approach involves writing \\nthe updates to a nonvolatile SSD buffer, which may be a flash memory or battery-operated DRAM, both of which operate at must faster speeds (see\\xa0Table\\xa016.1). The disk controller then updates the data file during its idle \\ntime and also when the buffer becomes full. During recovery from a crash, \\nunwritten SSD buffers must be written to the data file on HDD. For further \\ndiscussion of recovery and logs, consult Chapter 22.\\n16.2.3 SolidState Device (SSD) Storage\\nThis type of storage is sometimes known as flash storage because it is based on the flash memory technology, which we discussed in Section 16.1.1.\\nThe recent trend is to use flash memories as an intermediate layer between main \\nmemory and secondary rotating storage in the form of magnetic disks (HDDs). \\nSince they resemble disks in terms of the ability to store data in secondary storage \\nwithout the need for continuous power supply, they are called solid-state disks  or \\nsolid-state drives (SSDs) . We will discuss SSDs in general terms first and then \\ncomment on their use at the enterprise level, where they are sometimes referred to \\nas enterprise flash drives (EFDs),  a term first introduced by EMC Corporation.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 584}, page_content='554 Chapter 16 Disk Storage, Basic File Structures, Hashing, and Modern Storage Architectures\\nThe main component of an SSD is a controller and a set of interconnected flash \\nmemory cards. Use of NAND flash memory is most common. Using form factors compatible with 3.5 inch or 2.5 inch HDDs makes SSDs pluggable into slots already available for mounting HDDs on laptops and servers. For ultrabooks, tablets, and the like, card-based form factors such as mSATA and M.2 are being standardized. Interfaces like SATA express  have been created to keep up with advancements in \\nSSDs. Because there are no moving parts, the unit is more rugged, runs silently, is faster in terms of access time and provides higher transfer rates than HDD. As opposed to HDDs, where related data from the same relation must be placed on contiguous blocks, preferably on contiguous cylinders, there is no restriction on placement of data on an SSD since any address is directly addressable. As a result, the data is less likely to be fragmented; hence no reorganization is needed. Typi-cally, when a write to disk occurs on an HDD, the same block is overwritten with new data. In SDDs, the data is written to different NAND cells to attain wear-leveling , \\nwhich prolongs the life of the SSD. The main issue preventing a wide-scale adop-tion of SSDs today is their prohibitive cost (see Table 16.1), which tends to be about 70 to 80 cents per GB as opposed to about 15 to 20 cents per GB for HDDs.\\nIn addition to flash memory, DRAM-based SSDs are also available. They are cost-\\nlier than flash memory, but they offer faster access times of around 10 μs (microsec-onds) as opposed to 100 μs for flash. Their main drawback is that they need an internal battery or an adapter to supply power.\\nAs an example of an enterprise level SSD, we can consider CISCO’s UCS (Unified \\nComputing System\\n©) Invicta series SSDs. They have made it possible to deploy \\nSSDs at the data center level to unify workloads of all types, including databases and \\nvirtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), and to enable a cost-effective, energy-efficient, \\nand space-saving solution. CISCO’s claim is that Invicta SSDs offer a better price-\\nto-performance ratio to applications in a multitenant, multinetworked architecture because of the advantages of SSDs stated above. CISCO states that typically four times as many HDD drives may be needed to match an SSD-based RAID in perfor-mance.\\n6 The SSD configuration can have a capacity from 6 to 144 TB, with up to 1.2 \\nmillion I/O operations/second, and a bandwidth of up to 7.2 GB/sec with an aver-\\nage latency of 200 μs.7 Modern data centers are undergoing rapid transformation \\nand must provide real-time response using cloud-based architectures. In this envi-ronment, SSDs are likely to play a major role.\\n16.2.4 Magnetic Tape Storage Devices\\nDisks are random access  secondary storage devices because an arbitrary disk block \\nmay be accessed at random  once we specify its address.

Data is stored on reels of high-capacity magnetic tape, somewhat sim-\\nilar to audiotapes or videotapes. A tape drive is required to read the data from or write the data to a tape reel . Usually, each group of bits that forms a byte is stored \\nacross the tape, and the bytes themselves are stored consecutively on the tape.\\nA read/write head is used to read or write data on tape. Data records on tape are \\nalso stored in blocks—although the blocks may be substantially larger than those \\nfor disks, and interblock gaps are also quite large. With typical tape densities of \\n1,600 to 6,250 bytes per inch, a typical interblock gap\\n8 of 0.6 inch corresponds to \\n960 to 3,750 bytes of wasted storage space. It is customary to group many records together in one block for better space utilization.\\nThe main characteristic of a tape is its requirement that we access the data blocks in \\nsequential order . To get to a block in the middle of a reel of tape, the tape is mounted \\nand then scanned until the required block gets under the read/write head. For this reason, tape access can be slow and tapes are not used to store online data, except for some specialized applications. However, tapes serve a very important function—backing up  the database. One reason for backup is to keep copies of disk files in case \\nthe data is lost due to a disk crash, which can happen if the disk read/write head touches the disk surface because of mechanical malfunction. For this reason, disk files are copied periodically to tape. For many online critical applications, such as airline reservation systems, to avoid any downtime, mirrored systems are used to keep three sets of identical disks—two in online operation and one as backup. Here, offline disks become a backup device. The three are rotated so that they can be switched in case there is a failure on one of the live disk drives. Tapes can also be used to store excessively large database files. Database files that are seldom used or are outdated but required for historical recordkeeping can be archived  on tape. \\nOriginally, half-inch reel tape drives were used for data storage employing the so-called nine-track tapes. Later, smaller 8-mm magnetic tapes (similar to those used in camcorders) that can store up to 50 GB, as well as 4-mm helical scan data cartridges and writable CDs and DVDs, became popular media for backing up data files from PCs and workstations. They are also used for storing images and system libraries.\\nBacking up enterprise databases so that no transaction information is lost is a major \\nundertaking. Tape libraries were in vogue and featured slots for several hundred cartridges; these tape libraries used digital and superdigital linear tapes (DLTs and SDLTs), both of which have capacities in the hundreds of gigabytes and record data on linear tracks. These tape libraries are no longer in further development. The LTO (Linear Tape Open) consortium set up by IBM, HP, and Seagate released the latest LTO-6 standard in 2012 for tapes. It uses \\n1/2-inch-wide magnetic tapes like those \\nused in earlier tape drives but in a somewhat smaller, single-reel enclosed cartridge. \\nCurrent generation of libraries use LTO-6 drives, at 2.5-TB cartridge with 160 MB/s \\ntransfer rate. Average seek time is about 80 seconds. The T10000D drive of  \\nOracle/StorageTek handles 8.5 TB on a single cartridge with transfer rate upto 252\\xa0MB/s.\\n8Called interrecord gaps  in tape terminology.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 586}, page_content='556 Chapter 16 Disk Storage, Basic File Structures, Hashing, and Modern Storage Architectures\\nRobotic arms write on multiple cartridges in parallel using multiple tape drives and \\nautomatic labeling software to identify the backup cartridges. An example of a giant library is the SL8500 model of Sun Storage Technology. The SL8500 scales from 1,450 to just over 10,000 slots and from 1 to 64 tape drives within each library. It accepts both DLT/SDLT and LTO tapes. Up to 10 SL8500s can be connected within a single library complex for over 100,000 slots and up to 640 drives. With 100,000 slots, the SL8500 can store 2.1 exabytes (exabyte = 1,000 petabytes, or million TB = 10**18 bytes). We defer the discussion of disk storage technology called RAID, and of storage area networks, network-attached storage, and iSCSI storage systems, to the end of the chapter.\\n16.3 Buffering of Blocks\\nWhen several blocks need to be transferred from disk to main memory and all the block addresses are known, several buffers can be reserved in main memory to speed up the transfer. While one buffer is being read or written, the CPU can pro-cess data in the other buffer because an independent disk I/O processor (controller) exists that, once started, can proceed to transfer a data block between memory and disk independent of and in parallel to CPU processing.\\nFigure 16.3 illustrates how two processes can proceed in parallel. Processes A and B \\nare running concurrently  in an interleaved  fashion, whereas processes C and D are \\nrunning concurrently  in a parallel  fashion. When a single CPU controls multiple \\nprocesses, parallel execution is not possible. However, the processes can still run concurrently in an interleaved way. Buffering is most useful when processes can run concurrently in a parallel fashion, either because a separate disk I/O processor is available or because multiple CPU processors exist.\\nFigure 16.4 illustrates how reading and processing can proceed in parallel when the \\ntime required to process a disk block in memory is less than the time required to \\nInterleaved concurrency\\n of operations A and BParallel execution of\\n operations C and D\\nt1AA\\nBB\\nt2 t3 t4TimeFigure 16.3 \\nInterleaved concurrency versus parallel execution.'),\n",

The CPU can start processing a block once its \\ntransfer to main memory is completed; at the same time, the disk I/O processor can be reading and transferring the next block into a different buffer. This technique is called double buffering  and can also be used to read a continuous stream of blocks \\nfrom disk to memory. Double buffering permits continuous reading or writing of data on consecutive disk blocks, which eliminates the seek time and rotational delay for all but the first block transfer. Moreover, data is kept ready for processing, thus reducing the waiting time in the programs.\\n16.3.1 Buffer Management\\nBuffer management and Replacement Strategies. For most large database \\nfiles containing millions of pages, it is not possible to bring all of the data into main memory at the same time. We alluded to double buffering as a technique whereby we can gain efficiency in terms of performing the I/O operation between the disk and main memory into one buffer area concurrently with processing the data from another buffer. The actual management of buffers and decisions about what buffers to use to place a newly read page in the buffer is a more complex process. We use the term buffer  to refer to a part of main memory that is available to receive blocks \\nor pages of data from disk.\\n9 Buffer manager  is a software component of a DBMS \\nthat responds to requests for data and decides what buffer to use and what pages to replace in the buffer to accommodate the newly requested blocks. The buffer man-ager views the available main memory storage as a buffer pool , which has a collec-\\ntion of pages. The size of the shared buffer pool is typically a parameter for the DBMS controlled by DBAs. In this section, we briefly discuss the workings of the buffer manager and discuss a few replacement strategies.i + 1\\nProcess Bi + 2\\nFill A\\nTimei\\nProcess Ai + 1\\nFill BDisk Block:\\nI/O:\\nDisk Block:\\nPROCESSING:i\\nFill A\\ni + 2\\nProcess Ai + 3\\nFill A\\ni + 4\\nProcess Ai + 3\\nProcess Bi + 4\\nFill A\\nFigure 16.4 Use of two buffers, A and B, for reading from disk.\\n9We use the terms page and block interchangeably in the current context.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 588}, page_content='558 Chapter 16 Disk Storage, Basic File Structures, Hashing, and Modern Storage Architectures\\nThere are two kinds of buffer managers; the first kind controls the main memory \\ndirectly, as in most RDBMSs. The second kind allocates buffers in virtual memory, which allows the control to transfer to the operating system (OS). The OS in turn con-trols which buffers are actually in main memory and which ones are on disk under the control of OS. This second kind of buffer manager is common in main memory data-base systems and some object-oriented DBMSs. The overall goal of the buffer manager is twofold: (1) to maximize the probability that the requested page is found in main memory, and (2) in case of reading a new disk block from disk, to find a page to replace that will cause the least harm in the sense that it will not be required shortly again.\\nTo enable its operation, the buffer manager keeps two types of information on hand \\nabout each page in the buffer pool:\\n  1. A pin-count : the number of times that page has been requested, or the num-\\nber of current users of that page. If this count falls to zero, the page is consid-ered unpinned . Initially the pin-count for every page is set to zero. \\nIncrementing the pin-count is called pinning . In general, a pinned block \\nshould not be allowed to be written to disk.\\n  2. A dirty bit , which is initially set to zero for all pages but is set to 1 whenever \\nthat page is updated by any application program.\\nIn terms of storage management, the buffer manager has the following responsibil-\\nity: It must make sure that the number of buffers fits in main memory. If the requested amount of data exceeds available buffer space, the buffer manager must select what buffers must be emptied, as governed by the buffer replacement policy in force. If the buffer manager allocates space in virtual memory and all buffers in use exceed the actual main memory, then the common operating system problem of “thrashing” happens and pages get moved back and forth into the swap space on disk without performing useful work.\\nWhen a certain page is requested, the buffer manager takes following actions: it \\nchecks if the requested page is already in a buffer in the buffer pool; if so, it incre-ments its pin-count and releases the page. If the page is not in the buffer pool, the buffer manager does the following:\\na. It chooses a page for replacement, using the replacement policy, and incre-ments its pin-count.\\nb. If the dirty bit of the replacement page is on, the buffer manager writes that page to disk by replacing its old copy on disk. If the dirty bit is not on, this page \\nis not modified and the buffer manager is not required to write it back to disk.\\nc. It reads the requested page into the space just freed up.\\nd. The main memory address of the new page is passed to the requesting \\napplication.\\nIf there is no unpinned page available in the buffer pool and the requested page is \\nnot available in the buffer pool, the buffer manager may have to wait until a page \\ngets released. A transaction requesting this page may go into a wait state or may \\neven be aborted.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 589}, page_content='16.3 Buffering of Blocks  559\\n16.3.2 Buffer Replacement Strategies:\\nThe following are some popular replacement strategies that are similar to those \\nused elsewhere, such as in operating systems:\\n  1. Least recently used (LRU): The strategy here is to throw out that page that has not been used (read or written) for the longest time. This requires the buffer manager to maintain a table where it records the time every time a page in a buffer is accessed. Whereas this constitutes an overhead, the strat-egy works well because for a buffer that is not used for a long time, its chance of being accessed again is small.\\n  2. Clock policy: This is a round-robin variant of the LRU policy. Imagine the buffers are arranged like a circle similar to a clock. Each buffer has a flag with a 0 or 1 value. Buffers with a 0 are vulnerable and may be used for replacement and their contents read back to disk. Buffers with a 1 are not vulnerable. When a block is read into a buffer, the flag is set to 1. When the buffer is accessed, the flag is set to 1 also. The clock hand is positioned on a “current buffer.” When the buffer manager needs a buffer for a new block, it rotates the hand until it finds a buffer with a 0 and uses that to read and place the new block. (If the dirty bit is on for the page being replaced, that page will be written to disk, thus overwriting the old page at its address on disk.) If the clock hand passes buffers with 1s, it sets them to a zero. Thus, a block is replaced from its buffer only if it is not accessed until the hand com-pletes a rotation and returns to it and finds the block with the 0 that it set the last time.\\n  3. First-in-first-out (FIFO): Under this policy, when a buffer is required, the one that has been occupied the longest by a page is used for replacement. Under this policy, the manager notes the time each page gets loaded into a buffer; but it does not have to keep track of the time pages are accessed. Although FIFO needs less maintenance than LRU, it can work counter to desirable behavior. A block that remains in the buffer for a long time because it is needed continuously, such as a root block of an index, may be thrown out but may be immediately required to be brought back.\\nLRU and clock policies are not the best policies for database applications if they \\nrequire sequential scans of data and the file cannot fit into the buffer at one time. There are also situations when certain pages in buffers cannot be thrown out and written out to disk because certain other pinned pages point to those pages. Also, \\npolicies like FIFO can be modified to make sure that pinned blocks, such as root block of an index, are allowed to remain in the buffer. Modification of the clock policy also exists where important buffers can be set to higher values than 1 and \\ntherefore will not be subjected to replacement for several rotations of the hand. There are also situations when the DBMS has the ability to write certain blocks to disk even when the space occupied by those blocks is not needed. This is called force-writing  and occurs typically when log records have to be written to disk \\nahead of the modified pages in a transaction for recovery purposes. (See Chapter\\xa022.) There are some other replacement strategies such as MRU (most recently used)'),\n",

In this section, we define the concepts of records, record types, and files. Then we discuss techniques for placing file records on disk. Note that henceforth in this chapter we will be referring to the random access persistent secondary storage as “disk drive” or “disk.” The disk may be in different forms; for example, magnetic disks with rota-tional memory or solid-state disks with electronic access and no mechanical delays.\\n16.4.1 Records and Record Types\\nData is usually stored in the form of records . Each record consists of a collection of \\nrelated data values  or items , where each value is formed of one or more bytes and \\ncorresponds to a particular field  of the record. Records usually describe entities and \\ntheir attributes. For example, an EMPLOYEE  record represents an employee entity, \\nand each field value in the record specifies some attribute of that employee, such as \\nName , Birth_date , Salary , or Supervisor . A collection of field names and their corre-\\nsponding data types constitutes a record type  or record format  definition. A data \\ntype , associated with each field, specifies the types of values a field can take.\\nThe data type of a field is usually one of the standard data types used in program-\\nming. These include numeric (integer, long integer, or floating point), string of \\ncharacters (fixed-length or varying), Boolean (having 0 and 1 or TRUE  and FALSE  \\nvalues only), and sometimes specially coded date  and time  data types. The number \\nof bytes required for each data type is fixed for a given computer system. An integer \\nmay require 4 bytes, a long integer 8 bytes, a real number 4 bytes, a Boolean 1 byte, a date 10 bytes (assuming a format of YYYY-MM-DD), and a fixed-length string of k characters k bytes. Variable-length strings may require as many bytes as there are \\ncharacters in each field value. For example, an \\nEMPLOYEE  record type may be \\ndefined—using the C programming language notation—as the following structure:\\nstruct employee{\\n char name[30];\\n char ssn[9]; int salary; int job_code; char department[20];} ;\\nIn some database applications, the need may arise for storing data items that consist \\nof large unstructured objects, which represent images, digitized video or audio \\nstreams, or free text. These are referred to as BLOB s (binary large objects). A BLOB \\ndata item is typically stored separately from its record in a pool of disk blocks, and'),\n",

For storing free text, some DBMSs \\n(e.g., Oracle, DB2, etc.) provide a data type called CLOB (character large object); some DBMSs call this data type text.\\n16.4.2  Files, Fixed-Length Records,  \\nand Variable-Length Records\\nA file is a sequence  of records. In many cases, all records in a file are of the same \\nrecord type. If every record in the file has exactly the same size (in bytes), the file is said to be made up of fixed-length records . If different records in the file have dif-\\nferent sizes, the file is said to be made up of variable-length records . A file may \\nhave variable-length records for several reasons:\\n ■The file records are of the same record type, but one or more of the fields are \\nof varying size ( variable-length fields ). For example, the Name  field of \\nEMPLOYEE  can be a variable-length field.\\n ■The file records are of the same record type, but one or more of the fields may \\nhave multiple values for individual records; such a field is called a repeating \\nfield  and a group of values for the field is often called a repeating group .\\n ■The file records are of the same record type, but one or more of the fields are \\noptional ; that is, they may have values for some but not all of the file records \\n(optional fields ).\\n ■The file contains records of different record types  and hence of varying size \\n(mixed file ). This would occur if related records of different types were clustered  \\n(placed together) on disk blocks; for example, the GRADE_REPORT  records of \\na particular student may be placed following that STUDENT ’s record.\\nThe fixed-length EMPLOYEE  records in Figure 16.5(a) have a record size of 71 bytes. \\nEvery record has the same fields, and field lengths are fixed, so the system can iden-\\ntify the starting byte position of each field relative to the starting position of the \\nrecord. This facilitates locating field values by programs that access such files. Notice that it is possible to represent a file that logically should have variable-length records as a fixed-length records file. For example, in the case of optional fields, we could have every field  included in every file record  but store a special \\nNULL  value if \\nno value exists for that field. For a repeating field, we could allocate as many spaces \\nin each record as the maximum possible number of occurrences  of the field. In either \\ncase, space is wasted when certain records do not have values for all the physical spaces provided in each record. Now we consider other options for formatting records of a file of variable-length records.\\nFor variable-length fields,  each record has a value for each field, but we do not know \\nthe exact length of some field values. To determine the bytes within a particular record that represent each field, we can use special separator  characters (such as ? \\nor % or $)—which do not appear in any field value—to terminate variable-length fields, as shown in Figure 16.5(b), or we can store the length in bytes of the field in the record, preceding the field value.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 592}, page_content='562 Chapter 16 Disk Storage, Basic File Structures, Hashing, and Modern Storage Architectures\\nA file of records with optional fields  can be formatted in different ways. If the total \\nnumber of fields for the record type is large, but the number of fields that actually appear in a typical record is small, we can include in each record a sequence of <field-name, field-value> pairs rather than just the field values. Three types of sepa-rator characters are used in Figure 16.5(c), although we could use the same separa-tor character for the first two purposes—separating the field name from the field value and separating one field from the next field. A more practical option is to assign a short field type  code—say, an integer number—to each field and include in \\neach record a sequence of <field-type, field-value> pairs rather than <field-name, field-value> pairs.\\nA repeating field  needs one separator character to separate the repeating values of \\nthe field and another separator character to indicate termination of the field. Finally, for a file that includes records of different types,  each record is preceded by a record Name = Smith, John Ssn = 123456789 DEPARTMENT = ComputerSmith, JohnName1(a)\\n(b)\\n(c)11 22 1 2 5 2 9Name Ssn Salary Job_code Department Hire_date\\n31 40 44 48 68\\nSsn Salary Job_code Department\\nSeparator Characters 123456789 XXXX XXXX Computer\\nSeparator Characters\\nSeparates field name\\n from field value\\nSeparates fields\\nTerminates record=\\nFigure 16.5 \\nThree record storage formats.

Understandably, programs that process files of variable-length \\nrecords—which are usually part of the file system and hence hidden from the typi-cal programmers—need to be more complex than those for fixed-length records, where the starting position and size of each field are known and fixed.\\n10\\n16.4.3  Record Blocking and Spanned  \\nversus Unspanned Records\\nThe records of a file must be allocated to disk blocks because a block is the unit of data \\ntransfer  between disk and memory. When the block size is larger than the record size, \\neach block will contain numerous records, although some files may have unusually large records that cannot fit in one block. Suppose that the block size is B bytes. For a \\nfile of fixed-length records of size R bytes, with B ≥ R, we can fit bfr = ⎣B/R⎦ records \\nper block, where the ⎣(x)⎦ (floor function ) rounds down  the number x to an integer. \\nThe value bfr is called the blocking factor  for the file. In general, R may not divide B \\nexactly, so we have some unused space in each block equal to\\nB − (bfr * R) bytes\\nTo utilize this unused space, we can store part of a record on one block and the rest \\non another. A pointer  at the end of the first block points to the block containing the \\nremainder of the record in case it is not the next consecutive block on disk. This organization is called spanned  because records can span more than one block. \\nWhenever a record is larger than a block, we must  use a spanned organization. If \\nrecords are not allowed to cross block boundaries, the organization is called unspanned . This is used with fixed-length records having B > R because it makes \\neach record start at a known location in the block, simplifying record processing. For variable-length records, either a spanned or an unspanned organization can be used. If the average record is large, it is advantageous to use spanning to reduce the lost space in each block. Figure 16.6 illustrates spanned versus unspanned organization.\\nFor variable-length records using spanned organization, each block may store a dif-\\nferent number of records. In this case, the blocking factor bfr represents the average  \\n10Other schemes are also possible for representing variable-length records.Record 1 Block i Record 2 Record 3 Record 4 P\\nRecord 4 (rest) Block i + 1 Record 5 Record 6 Record 7 PRecord 1 Block i\\n(b)(a) Record 2 Record 3\\nRecord 4 Block i + 1 Record 5 Record 6Figure 16.6 \\nTypes of record organization.

We can use bfr to calculate the number of \\nblocks b needed for a file of r records:\\nb = ⎡(r/bfr)⎤ blocks\\nwhere the ⎡(x)⎤ (ceiling function ) rounds the value x up to the next integer.\\n16.4.4 Allocating File Blocks on Disk\\nThere are several standard techniques for allocating the blocks of a file on disk. In \\ncontiguous allocation , the file blocks are allocated to consecutive disk blocks. This \\nmakes reading the whole file very fast using double buffering, but it makes expand ing \\nthe file difficult. In linked allocation , each file block contains a pointer to the next file \\nblock. This makes it easy to expand the file but makes it slow to read the whole file. A combination of the two allocates clusters  of consecutive disk blocks, and the clusters \\nare linked. Clusters are sometimes called file segments  or extents . Another possibil-\\nity is to use indexed allocation , where one or more index blocks  contain pointers to \\nthe actual file blocks. It is also common to use combinations of these techniques.\\n16.4.5 File Headers\\nA file header  or file descriptor  contains information about a file that is needed by \\nthe system programs that access the file records. The header includes information \\nto determine the disk addresses of the file blocks as well as to record format descrip-\\ntions, which may include field lengths and the order of fields within a record for \\nfixed-length unspanned records and field type codes, separator characters, and record type codes for variable-length records.\\nTo search for a record on disk, one or more blocks are copied into main memory \\nbuffers. Programs then search for the desired record or records within the buffers, using the information in the file header. If the address of the block that contains the desired record is not known, the search programs must do a linear search  through \\nthe file blocks. Each file block is copied into a buffer and searched until the record is located or all the file blocks have been searched unsuccessfully. This can be very time-consuming for a large file. The goal of a good file organization is to avoid lin-ear search or full scan of the file and to locate the block that contains a desired record with a minimal number of block transfers.\\n16.5 Operations on Files\\nOperations on files are usually grouped into retrieval operations  and update \\n operations . The former do not change any data in the file, but only locate certain \\nrecords so that their field values can be examined and processed. The latter change \\nthe file by insertion or deletion of records or by modification of field values. In \\neither case, we may have to select  one or more records for retrieval, deletion, or \\nmodification based on a selection condition  (or filtering condition ), which specifies \\ncriteria that the desired record or records must satisfy.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 595}, page_content='16.5 Operations on Files  565\\nConsider an EMPLOYEE  file with fields Name , Ssn, Salary , Job_code , and Department . \\nA simple selection condition  may involve an equality comparison on some field \\nvalue—for example, ( Ssn = ‘123456789’) or ( Department  = ‘Research’). More com-\\nplex conditions can involve other types of comparison operators, such as > or ≥ ; an \\nexample is ( Salary  ≥ 30000). The general case is to have an arbitrary Boolean expres-\\nsion on the fields of the file as the selection condition.\\nSearch operations on files are generally based on simple selection conditions. A \\ncomplex condition must be decomposed by the DBMS (or the programmer) to extract a simple condition that can be used to locate the records on disk. Each located record is then checked to determine whether it satisfies the full selection condition. For example, we may extract the simple condition (\\nDepartment  = \\n‘Research’) from the complex condition (( Salary  ≥ 30000) AND  (Department  = \\n‘Research’)); each record satisfying ( Department  = ‘Research’) is located and then \\ntested to see if it also satisfies ( Salary  ≥ 30000).\\nWhen several file records satisfy a search condition, the first record—with respect \\nto the physical sequence of file records—is initially located and designated the \\n current record . Subsequent search operations commence from this record and \\nlocate the next  record in the file that satisfies the condition.\\nActual operations for locating and accessing file records vary from system to sys-\\ntem. In the following list, we present a set of representative operations. Typically, \\nhigh-level programs, such as DBMS software programs, access records by using \\nthese commands, so we sometimes refer to program variables  in the following \\ndescriptions:\\n ■Open.  Prepares the file for reading or writing. Allocates appropriate buffers \\n(typically at least two) to hold file blocks from disk, and retrieves the file \\nheader. Sets the file pointer to the beginning of the file.\\n ■Reset.  Sets the file pointer of an open file to the beginning of the file.\\n ■Find (or Locate).  Searches for the first record that satisfies a search condi-\\ntion. Transfers the block containing that record into a main memory buffer \\n(if it is not already there). The file pointer points to the record in the buffer \\nand it becomes the current record.  Sometimes, different verbs are used to \\nindicate whether the located record is to be retrieved or updated.\\n ■Read (or Get).  Copies the current record from the buffer to a program vari-\\nable in the user program. This command may also advance the current record pointer to the next record in the file, which may necessitate reading the next file block from disk.\\n ■FindNext.  Searches for the next record in the file that satisfies the search \\ncondition. Transfers the block containing that record into a main memory \\nbuffer (if it is not already there). The record is located in the buffer and \\nbecomes the current record. Various forms of FindNext (for example, \\n FindNext record within a current parent record, FindNext record of a given \\ntype, or FindNext record where a complex condition is met) are available in legacy DBMSs based on the hierarchical and network models.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 596}, page_content='566 Chapter 16 Disk Storage, Basic File Structures, Hashing, and Modern Storage Architectures\\n ■Delete.  Deletes the current record and (eventually) updates the file on disk \\nto reflect the deletion.\\n ■Modify.  Modifies some field values for the current record and (eventually) \\nupdates the file on disk to reflect the modification.\\n ■Insert.  Inserts a new record in the file by locating the block where the record \\nis to be inserted, transferring that block into a main memory buffer (if it is not already there), writing the record into the buffer, and (eventually) writ-ing the buffer to disk to reflect the insertion.\\n ■Close.  Completes the file access by releasing the buffers and performing any \\nother needed cleanup operations.\\nThe preceding (except for Open and Close) are called record-at-a-time  operations \\nbecause each operation applies to a single record. It is possible to streamline the \\noperations Find, FindNext, and Read into a single operation, Scan, whose descrip-\\ntion is as follows:\\n ■Scan.  If the file has just been opened or reset, Scan  returns the first record; \\notherwise it returns the next record. If a condition is specified with the oper-ation, the returned record is the first or next record satisfying the condition.\\nIn database systems, additional set-at-a-time  higher-level operations may be \\napplied to a file. Examples of these are as follows:\\n ■FindAll.  Locates all the records in the file that satisfy a search condition.\\n ■Find (or Locate) n. Searches for the first record that satisfies a search condi-\\ntion and then continues to locate the next n − 1 records satisfying the same \\ncondition. Transfers the blocks containing the n records to the main mem-\\nory buffer (if not already there).\\n ■FindOrdered.  Retrieves all the records in the file in some specified order.\\n ■Reorganize.  Starts the reorganization process. As we shall see, some file \\norganizations require periodic reorganization. An example is to reorder the file records by sorting them on a specified field.\\nAt this point, it is worthwhile to note the difference between the terms file organiza-\\ntion and access method.  A file organization  refers to the organization of the data of \\na file into records, blocks, and access structures; this includes the way records and blocks are placed on the storage medium and interlinked. An access method , on \\nthe other hand, provides a group of operations—such as those listed earlier—that can be applied to a file. In general, it is possible to apply several access methods to a file organized using a certain organization. Some access methods, though, can be \\napplied only to files organized in certain ways. For example, we cannot apply an \\nindexed access method to a file without an index (see Chapter 17).\\nUsually, we expect to use some search conditions more than others. Some files may \\nbe static , meaning that update operations are rarely performed; other, more \\ndynamic  files may change frequently, so update operations are constantly applied \\nto them. If a file is not updatable by the end user, it is regarded as a read-only file.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 597}, page_content='16.6 Files of Unordered Records (Heap Files)  567\\nMost data warehouses (see Chapter 29) predominantly contain read-only files. A \\nsuccessful file organization should perform as efficiently as possible the operations we expect to apply frequently  to the file. For example, consider the \\nEMPLOYEE  file, \\nas shown in Figure 16.5(a), which stores the records for current employees in a company. We expect to insert records (when employees are hired), delete records (when employees leave the company), and modify records (for example, when an employee’s salary or job is changed). Deleting or modifying a record requires a selection condition to identify a particular record or set of records. Retrieving one or more records also requires a selection condition.\\nIf users expect mainly to apply a search condition based on \\nSsn, the designer must \\nchoose a file organization that facilitates locating a record given its Ssn value. This \\nmay involve physically ordering the records by Ssn value or defining an index on \\nSsn (see Chapter 17). Suppose that a second application uses the file to generate \\nemployees’ paychecks and requires that paychecks are grouped by department. For this application, it is best to order employee records by department and then by name within each department. The clustering of records into blocks and the orga-nization of blocks on cylinders would now be different than before. However, this arrangement conflicts with ordering the records by \\nSsn values. If both applications \\nare important, the designer should choose an organization that allows both opera-\\ntions to be done efficiently. Unfortunately, in many cases a single organization does \\nnot allow all needed operations on a file to be implemented efficiently. Since a file \\ncan be stored only once using one particular organization, the DBAs are often faced with making a difficult design choice about the file organization. They make it based on the expected importance and mix of retrieval and update operations.\\nIn the following sections and in Chapter 17, we discuss methods for organizing \\nrecords of a file on disk. Several general techniques, such as ordering, hashing, and indexing, are used to create access methods. Additionally, various general tech-niques for handling insertions and deletions work with many file organizations.\\n16.6 Files of Unordered Records (Heap Files)\\nIn this simplest and most basic type of organization, records are placed in the file in the order in which they are inserted, so new records are inserted at the end of the file. Such an organization is called a heap  or pile file .\\n11 This organization is often \\nused with additional access paths, such as the secondary indexes discussed in Chap-ter 17. It is also used to collect and store data records for future use.\\nInserting a new record is very efficient.  The last disk block of the file is copied into a \\nbuffer, the new record is added, and the block is then rewritten  back to disk. The \\naddress of the last file block is kept in the file header. However, searching for a record using any search condition involves a linear search  through the file block by \\nblock—an expensive procedure. If only one record satisfies the search condition, then, on the average, a program will read into memory and search half the file \\n11Sometimes this organization is called a sequential file .'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 598}, page_content='568 Chapter 16 Disk Storage, Basic File Structures, Hashing, and Modern Storage Architectures\\nblocks before it finds the record. For a file of b blocks, this requires searching ( b/2) \\nblocks, on average. If no records or several records satisfy the search condition, the program must read and search all b blocks in the file.\\nTo delete a record, a program must first find its block, copy the block into a buffer, \\ndelete the record from the buffer, and finally rewrite the block  back to the disk. \\nThis leaves unused space in the disk block. Deleting a large number of records in \\nthis way results in wasted storage space. Another technique used for record deletion \\nis to have an extra byte or bit, called a deletion marker , stored with each record. A \\nrecord is deleted by setting the deletion marker to a certain value. A different value for the marker indicates a valid (not deleted) record. Search programs consider only valid records in a block when conducting their search. Both of these deletion techniques require periodic reorganization  of the file to reclaim the unused space \\nof deleted records. During reorganization, the file blocks are accessed consecu-tively, and records are packed by removing deleted records. After such a reorgani-zation, the blocks are filled to capacity once more. Another possibility is to use the space of deleted records when inserting new records, although this requires extra bookkeeping to keep track of empty locations.\\nWe can use either spanned or unspanned organization for an unordered file, and it \\nmay be used with either fixed-length or variable-length records. Modifying a vari-able-length record may require deleting the old record and inserting a modified record because the modified record may not fit in its old space on disk.\\nTo read all records in order of the values of some field, we create a sorted copy of \\nthe file. Sorting is an expensive operation for a large disk file, and special techniques for external sorting  are used (see Chapter 18).\\nFor a file of unordered fixed-length records  using unspanned blocks  and contiguous \\nallocation,  it is straightforward to access any record by its position  in the file. If the \\nfile records are numbered 0, 1, 2, … , r − 1 and the records in each block are num-\\nbered 0, 1, …, bfr − 1, where bfr is the blocking factor, then the ith record of the file \\nis located in block ⎣(i/bfr )⎦ and is the ( i mod bfr)th record in that block. Such a file \\nis often called a relative  or direct file  because records can easily be accessed directly \\nby their relative positions. Accessing a record by its position does not help locate a record based on a search condition; however, it facilitates the construction of access paths on the file, such as the indexes discussed in Chapter 17.\\n16.7 Files of Ordered Records (Sorted Files)\\nWe can physically order the records of a file on disk based on the values of one of their fields—called the ordering field . This leads to an ordered  or sequential  file.\\n12 \\nIf the ordering field is also a key field  of the file—a field guaranteed to have a unique \\nvalue in each record—then the field is called the ordering key  for the file. Figure 16.7 \\n12The term sequential file  has also been used to refer to unordered files, although it is more appropriate \\nfor ordered files.'),\n",

First, reading the \\nrecords in order of the ordering key values becomes extremely efficient because no sorting is required. The search condition may be of the type < key = value>, or a range condition such as < value1 < key < value2>. Second, finding the next record from the current one in order of the ordering key usually requires no additional block accesses because the next record is in the same block as the current one (unless the current record is the last one in the block). Third, using a search condi-tion based on the value of an ordering key field results in faster access when the binary search technique is used, which constitutes an improvement over linear searches, although it is not often used for disk files. Ordered files are blocked and stored on contiguous cylinders to minimize the seek time.\\nA binary search  for disk files can be done on the blocks rather than on the records. \\nSuppose that the file has b blocks numbered 1, 2, …, b; the records are ordered by \\nascending value of their ordering key field; and we are searching for a record whose ordering key field value is K. Assuming that disk addresses of the file blocks are \\navailable in the file header, the binary search can be described by Algorithm 16.1. A binary search usually accesses log\\n2(b) blocks, whether the record is found or not—an \\nimprovement over linear searches, where, on the average, ( b/2) blocks are accessed \\nwhen the record is found and b blocks are accessed when the record is not found.\\nAlgorithm 16.1.

To access the records in order based on a non-\\nordering field, it is necessary to create another sorted copy—in a different order—of the file.\\nInserting and deleting records are expensive operations for an ordered file because \\nthe records must remain physically ordered. To insert a record, we must find its correct position in the file, based on its ordering field value, and then make space in the file to insert the record in that position. For a large file this can be very time-consuming because, on the average, half the records of the file must be moved to make space for the new record. This means that half the file blocks must be read and rewritten after records are moved among them. For record deletion, the prob-lem is less severe if deletion markers and periodic reorganization are used.\\nOne option for making insertion more efficient is to keep some unused space in each \\nblock for new records. However, once this space is used up, the original problem resurfaces. Another frequently used method is to create a temporary unordered  file \\ncalled an overflow  or transaction  file. With this technique, the actual ordered file is \\ncalled the main  or master  file. New records are inserted at the end of the overflow \\nfile rather than in their correct position in the main file. Periodically, the overflow file is sorted and merged with the master file during file reorganization. Insertion becomes very efficient, but at the cost of increased complexity in the search algo-rithm. One option is to keep the highest value of the key in each block in a separate field after taking into account the keys that have overflown from that block. Other-wise, the overflow file must be searched using a linear search if, after the binary search, the record is not found in the main file. For applications that do not require the most up-to-date information, overflow records can be ignored during a search.\\nModifying a field value of a record depends on two factors: the search condition to \\nlocate the record and the field to be modified. If the search condition involves the ordering key field, we can locate the record using a binary search; otherwise we must do a linear search. A nonordering field can be modified by changing the record and rewriting it in the same physical location on disk—assuming fixed-length records. Modifying the ordering field means that the record can change its position in the file. This requires deletion of the old record followed by insertion of the modified record.\\nReading the file records in order of the ordering field is efficient if we ignore the \\nrecords in overflow, since the blocks can be read consecutively using double buffer-ing. To include the records in overflow, we must merge them in their correct posi-tions; in this case, first we can reorganize the file, and then read its blocks sequentially. To reorganize the file, first we sort the records in the overflow file, and then merge them with the master file. The records marked for deletion are removed during the reorganization.\\nTable 16.3 summarizes the average access time in block accesses to find a specific \\nrecord in a file with b blocks.\\nOrdered files are rarely used in database applications unless an additional access \\npath, called a primary index , is used; this results in an indexed-sequential file .'),\n",

(We dis-\\ncuss indexes in Chapter 17.) If the ordering attribute is not a key, the file is called a clustered file .\\n16.8 Hashing Techniques\\nAnother type of primary file organization is based on hashing, which provides very \\nfast access to records under certain search conditions. This organization is usually called a hash file .\\n13 The search condition must be an equality condition on a single \\nfield, called the hash field . In most cases, the hash field is also a key field of the file, \\nin which case it is called the hash key . The idea behind hashing is to provide a func-\\ntion h, called a hash function  or randomizing function , which is applied to the \\nhash field value of a record and yields the address  of the disk block in which the \\nrecord is stored. A search for the record within the block can be carried out in a main memory buffer. For most records, we need only a single-block access to retrieve that record.\\nHashing is also used as an internal search structure within a program whenever \\na group of records is accessed exclusively by using the value of one field. We describe the use of hashing for internal files in Section 16.8.1; then we show how it is modified to store external files on disk in Section 16.8.2. In Sec-\\ntion\\xa016.8.3 we discuss techniques for extending hashing to dynamically growing \\nfiles.\\n16.8.1 Internal Hashing\\nFor internal files, hashing is typically implemented as a hash table  through the use \\nof an array of records. Suppose that the array index range is from 0 to M – 1, as \\nshown in Figure 16.8(a); then we have M slots  whose addresses correspond to the \\narray indexes. We choose a hash function that transforms the hash field value into an integer between 0 and M − 1. One common hash function is the h(K) = K mod  \\nM function, which returns the remainder of an integer hash field value K after divi-\\nsion by M; this value is then used for the record address.Table 16.3  Average Access Times for a File of b Blocks under Basic File Organizations\\n \\nType of Organization \\nAccess/Search MethodAverage Blocks to Access  \\na Specific Record\\nHeap (unordered) Sequential scan (linear search) b/2\\nOrdered Sequential scan b/2\\nOrdered Binary search log 2 b\\n13A hash file has also been called a direct file .'),\n",

One technique, called folding , involves apply-\\ning an arithmetic function such as addition  or a logical function such as exclusive or  \\nto different portions of the hash field value to calculate the hash address (for exam-\\nple, with an address space from 0 to 999 to store 1,000 keys, a 6-digit key 235469 \\nmay be folded and stored at the address: (235+964) mod 1000 = 199). Another tech-\\nnique involves picking some digits of the hash field value—for instance, the third, \\nfifth, and eighth digits—to form the hash address (for example, storing 1,000 \\nemployees with Social Security numbers of 10 digits into a hash file with 1,000 posi-\\ntions would give the Social Security number 301-67-8923 a hash value of 172 by this \\nhash function).14 The problem with most hashing functions is that they do not \\nguarantee that distinct values will hash to distinct addresses, because the hash field \\nspace —the number of possible values a hash field can take—is usually much larger \\nthan the address space —the number of available addresses for records. The hash-\\ning function maps the hash field space to the address space.\\nA collision  occurs when the hash field value of a record that is being inserted hashes \\nto an address that already contains a different record. In this situation, we must \\ninsert the new record in some other position, since its hash address is occupied. The \\nprocess of finding another position is called collision resolution . There are numer-\\nous methods for collision resolution, including the following:\\n ■Open addressing.  Proceeding from the occupied position specified by the \\nhash address, the program checks the subsequent positions in order until an unused (empty) position is found. Algorithm 16.2(b) may be used for this purpose.\\n ■Chaining.  For this method, various overflow locations are kept, usually by \\nextending the array with a number of overflow positions. Additionally, a pointer field is added to each record location. A collision is resolved by plac-ing the new record in an unused overflow location and setting the pointer of the occupied hash address location to the address of that overflow location. \\n14 A detailed discussion of hashing functions is outside the scope of our presentation.'),\n",

The program applies a second hash function if the first \\nresults in a collision. If another collision results, the program uses open addressing or applies a third hash function and then uses open addressing if necessary. Note that the series of hash functions are used in the same order for retrieval.\\nEach collision resolution method requires its own algorithms for insertion, retrieval, \\nand deletion of records. The algorithms for chaining are the simplest. Deletion algorithms for open addressing are rather tricky. Data structures textbooks discuss internal hashing algorithms in more detail.\\nThe goal of a good hashing function is twofold: first, to distribute the records uni-\\nformly over the address space so as to minimize collisions, thus making it possible to locate a record with a given key in a single access. The second, somewhat con-flicting, goal is to achieve the above yet occupy the buckets fully, thus not leaving many unused locations. Simulation and analysis studies have shown that it is usu-ally best to keep a hash file between 70 and 90% full so that the number of collisions remains low and we do not waste too much space. Hence, if we expect to have r \\nrecords to store in the table, we should choose M locations for the address space \\nsuch that ( r/M) is between 0.7 and 0.9. It may also be useful to choose a prime num-\\nber for M, since it has been demonstrated that this distributes the hash addresses \\nbetter over the address space when the mod hashing function is used modulo a prime number. Other hash functions may require M to be a power of 2.\\n16.8.2 External Hashing for Disk Files\\nHashing for disk files is called external hashing . To suit the characteristics of disk \\nstorage, the target address space is made of buckets , each of which holds multiple \\nrecords. A bucket is either one disk block or a cluster of contiguous disk blocks. \\nThe hashing function maps a key into a relative bucket number rather than assigning an absolute block address to the bucket. A table maintained in the file header converts the bucket number into the corresponding disk block address, as illustrated in Figure 16.9.\\nThe collision problem is less severe with buckets, because as many records as will fit \\nin a bucket can hash to the same bucket without causing problems. However, we must make provisions for the case where a bucket is filled to capacity and a new record being inserted hashes to that bucket. We can use a variation of chaining in which a pointer is maintained in each bucket to a linked list of overflow records for the bucket, as shown in Figure 16.10. The pointers in the linked list should be record pointers , which include both a block address and a relative record position \\nwithin the block.\\nHashing provides the fastest possible access for retrieving an arbitrary record given \\nthe value of its hash field. Although most good hash functions do not maintain'),\n",

A simple example of an order-preserving hash function is to take the leftmost three digits of an invoice number field that yields a bucket address as the hash address and keep the records sorted by invoice number within each bucket. Another example is to use an integer hash key directly as an index to a relative file, if the hash key values fill up a particular interval; for example, if employee numbers in a com-pany are assigned as 1, 2, 3, … up to the total number of employees, we can use the identity hash function (i.e., Relative Address = Key) that maintains order. Unfortu-nately, this only works if sequence keys are generated in order by some application.\\nThe hashing scheme described so far is called static hashing  because a fixed num-\\nber of buckets M is allocated. The function does key-to-address mapping, whereby \\nwe are fixing the address space. This can be a serious drawback for dynamic files. Suppose that we allocate M buckets for the address space and let m be the maxi-\\nmum number of records that can fit in one bucket; then at most ( m * M) records \\nwill fit in the allocated space. If the number of records turns out to be substantially fewer than ( m * M), we are left with a lot of unused space. On the other hand, if the \\nnumber of records increases to substantially more than ( m * M), numerous colli-\\nsions will result and retrieval will be slowed down because of the long lists of over-flow records. In either case, we may have to change the number of blocks M \\nallocated and then use a new hashing function (based on the new value of M) to \\nredistribute the records. These reorganizations can be quite time-consuming for large files. Newer dynamic file organizations based on hashing allow the number of buckets to vary dynamically with only localized reorganization (see Section 16.8.3).\\nWhen using external hashing, searching for a record given a value of some field \\nother than the hash field is as expensive as in the case of an unordered file. Record deletion can be implemented by removing the record from its bucket. If the bucket has an overflow chain, we can move one of the overflow records into the bucket to replace the deleted record. If the record to be deleted is already in overflow, we sim-ply remove it from the linked list. Notice that removing an overflow record implies that we should keep track of empty positions in overflow. This is done easily by maintaining a linked list of unused overflow locations.\\nModifying a specific record’s field value depends on two factors: the search condi-\\ntion to locate that specific record and the field to be modified. If the search condi-tion is an equality comparison on the hash field, we can locate the record efficiently by using the hashing function; otherwise, we must do a linear search. A nonhash field can be modified by changing the record and rewriting it in the same bucket. Modifying the hash field means that the record can move to another bucket, which requires deletion of the old record followed by insertion of the modified record.\\n16.8.3 Hashing Techniques That Allow Dynamic File Expansion\\nA major drawback of the static  hashing scheme just discussed is that the hash \\naddress space is fixed. Hence, it is difficult to expand or shrink the file dynamically. The schemes described in this section attempt to remedy this situation. The first'),\n",

The main difference is that the access structure is based on the values that result after application of the hash function to the search field. In indexing, the access structure is based on the values of the search field itself. The second technique, called linear hashing, does not require additional access structures. Another scheme, called dynamic hashing , uses \\nan access structure based on binary tree data structures.\\nThese hashing schemes take advantage of the fact that the result of applying a hash-\\ning function is a nonnegative integer and hence can be represented as a binary number. The access structure is built on the binary representation  of the hashing \\nfunction result, which is a string of bits. We call this the hash value  of a record. \\nRecords are distributed among buckets based on the values of the leading bits  in \\ntheir hash values.\\nExtendible Hashing. In extendible hashing, proposed by Fagin (1979), a type of \\ndirectory—an array of 2\\nd bucket addresses—is maintained, where d is called the \\nglobal depth  of the directory. The integer value corresponding to the first (high-\\norder) d bits of a hash value is used as an index to the array to determine a directory \\nentry, and the address in that entry determines the bucket in which the correspond-\\ning records are stored. However, there does not have to be a distinct bucket for each \\nof the 2d directory locations. Several directory locations with the same first d′ bits \\nfor their hash values may contain the same bucket address if all the records that \\nhash to these locations fit in a single bucket. A local depth  d′—stored with each \\nbucket—specifies the number of bits on which the bucket contents are based. Fig-\\nure 16.11 shows a directory with global depth d = 3.\\nThe value of d can be increased or decreased by one at a time, thus doubling or \\nhalving the number of entries in the directory array. Doubling is needed if a bucket, whose local depth d′ is equal to the global depth d, overflows. Halving occurs if \\nd > d′ for all the buckets after some deletions occur. Most record retrievals require \\ntwo block accesses—one to the directory and the other to the bucket.\\nTo illustrate bucket splitting, suppose that a new inserted record causes overflow in \\nthe bucket whose hash values start with 01—the third bucket in Figure 16.11. The records will be distributed between two buckets: the first contains all records whose hash values start with 010, and the second all those whose hash values start with\\xa0011. Now the two directory locations for 010 and 011 point to the two new distinct buckets. Before the split, they pointed to the same bucket. The local depth d′ of the \\ntwo new buckets is 3, which is one more than the local depth of the old bucket.\\nIf a bucket that overflows and is split used to have a local depth d′ equal to the \\nglobal depth d of the directory, then the size of the directory must now be doubled \\nso that we can use an extra bit to distinguish the two new buckets. For example, if the bucket for records whose hash values start with 111 in Figure 16.11 overflows, the two new buckets need a directory with global depth d = 4, because the two \\nbuckets are now labeled 1110 and 1111, and hence their local depths are both 4.

The space overhead for the directory table is negligible. The \\nmaximum directory size is 2k, where k is the number of bits in the hash value. \\nAnother advantage is that splitting causes minor reorganization in most cases, since only the records in one bucket are redistributed to the two new buckets. The only time reorganization is more expensive is when the directory has to be doubled (or halved). A disadvantage is that the directory must be searched before accessing the buckets themselves, resulting in two block accesses instead of one in static hashing. This performance penalty is considered minor and thus the scheme is considered quite desirable for dynamic files.\\nDynamic Hashing. A precursor to extendible hashing was dynamic hashing pro-\\nposed by Larson (1978), in which the addresses of the buckets were either the n \\nhigh-order bits or n − 1 high-order bits, depending on the total number of keys \\nbelonging to the respective bucket. The eventual storage of records in buckets for \\ndynamic hashing is somewhat similar to extendible hashing. The major difference is in the organization of the directory. Whereas extendible hashing uses the notion of global depth (high-order d bits) for the flat directory and then combines adjacent \\ncollapsible buckets into a bucket of local depth d − 1, dynamic hashing maintains a \\ntree-structured directory with two types of nodes:\\n ■Internal nodes that have two pointers—the left pointer corresponding to the \\n0 bit (in the hashed address) and a right pointer corresponding to the 1 bit.\\n ■Leaf nodes—these hold a pointer to the actual bucket with records.\\nAn example of the dynamic hashing appears in Figure 16.12. Four buckets are \\nshown (“000”, “001”, “110”, and “111”) with high-order 3-bit addresses (corre-sponding to the global depth of 3), and two buckets (“01” and “10”) are shown with high-order 2-bit addresses (corresponding to the local depth of 2). The latter two are the result of collapsing the “010” and “011” into “01” and collapsing “100” and “101” into “10”. Note that the directory nodes are used implicitly to deter-mine the “global” and “local” depths of buckets in dynamic hashing. The search for a record given the hashed address involves traversing the directory tree, which leads to the bucket holding that record. It is left to the reader to develop algo-rithms for insertion, deletion, and searching of records for the dynamic hashing scheme.\\nLinear Hashing. The idea behind linear hashing, proposed by Litwin (1980), is to \\nallow a hash file to expand and shrink its number of buckets dynamically without  \\nneeding a directory. Suppose that the file starts with M buckets numbered 0, 1, … , \\nM − 1 and uses the mod hash function h(K) = K mod M; this hash function is called \\nthe initial hash function  h\\ni. Overflow because of collisions is still needed and can \\nbe handled by maintaining individual overflow chains for each bucket. However, \\nwhen a collision leads to an overflow record in any file bucket, the first bucket in the \\nfile—bucket 0—is split into two buckets: the original bucket 0 and a new bucket M \\nat the end of the file. The records originally in bucket 0 are distributed between the \\ntwo buckets based on a different hashing function hi+1(K) = K mod 2 M. A key prop-\\nerty of the two hash functions hi and hi+1 is that any records that hashed to bucket 0'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 611}, page_content='16.8 Hashing Techniques  581\\nbased on hi will hash to either bucket 0 or bucket M based on hi+1; this is necessary \\nfor linear hashing to work.\\nAs further collisions lead to overflow records, additional buckets are split in the \\nlinear  order 1, 2, 3, … . If enough overflows occur, all the original file buckets 0, 1, \\n… , M − 1 will have been split, so the file now has 2 M instead of M buckets, and all \\nbuckets use the hash function hi+1. Hence, the records in overflow are eventually \\nredistributed into regular buckets, using the function hi+1 via a delayed split  of their \\nbuckets. There is no directory; only a value n—which is initially set to 0 and is \\nincremented by 1 whenever a split occurs—is needed to determine which buckets have been split. To retrieve a record with hash key value K, first apply the function \\nh\\ni to K; if hi(K) < n, then apply the function hi+1 on K because the bucket is already \\nsplit. Initially, n = 0, indicating that the function hi applies to all buckets; n grows \\nlinearly as buckets are split.Data File Buckets\\nBucket for records\\nwhose hash values\\nstart with 000\\nBucket for records\\nwhose hash values\\nstart with 001\\nBucket for records\\nwhose hash valuesstart with 01\\nBucket for records\\nwhose hash values\\nstart with 10\\nBucket for records\\nwhose hash values\\nstart with 110\\nBucket for records\\nwhose hash values\\nstart with 111Directory\\n0\\n1\\n010\\n1\\n0\\n10\\n1internal directory node\\nleaf directory node\\nFigure 16.12 \\nStructure of the dynamic hashing scheme.'),\n",

At this point, \\nn is reset to 0 (zero), and any new collisions that cause overflow lead to the use of a \\nnew hashing function hi+2(K) = K mod 4 M. In general, a sequence of hashing func-\\ntions hi+j(K) = K mod (2jM) is used, where j = 0, 1, 2, … ; a new hashing function \\nhi+j+1 is needed whenever all the buckets 0, 1, …, (2jM) − 1 have been split and n is \\nreset to 0. The search for a record with hash key value K is given by Algorithm 16.3.\\nSplitting can be controlled by monitoring the file load factor instead of by splitting \\nwhenever an overflow occurs. In general, the file load factor  l can be defined as \\nl = r/(bfr * N), where r is the current number of file records, bfr is the maximum \\nnumber of records that can fit in a bucket, and N is the current number of file buck-\\nets. Buckets that have been split can also be recombined if the load factor of the file falls below a certain threshold. Blocks are combined linearly, and N is decremented \\nappropriately. The file load can be used to trigger both splits and combinations; in this manner the file load can be kept within a desired range. Splits can be triggered when the load exceeds a certain threshold—say, 0.9—and combinations can be trig-gered when the load falls below another threshold—say, 0.7. The main advantages of linear hashing are that it maintains the load factor fairly constantly while the file grows and shrinks, and it does not require a directory.\\n15\\nAlgorithm 16.3.

Relationships among records in various files can be represented by connecting fields .\\n16 For example, a \\n15For details of insertion and deletion into Linear hashed files, refer to Litwin (1980) and Salzberg (1988).\\n16The concept of foreign keys in the relational data model (Chapter 3) and references among objects in \\nobject-oriented models (Chapter 11) are examples of connecting fields.'),\n",

This Major_dept  field refers  to \\na DEPARTMENT  entity, which should be represented by a record of its own in the \\nDEPARTMENT  file. If we want to retrieve field values from two related records, we \\nmust retrieve one of the records first. Then we can use its connecting field value to retrieve the related record in the other file. Hence, relationships are implemented by logical field references  among the records in distinct files.\\nFile organizations in object DBMSs, as well as legacy systems such as hierarchical \\nand network DBMSs, often implement relationships among records as physical \\nrelationships  realized by physical contiguity (or clustering) of related records or by \\nphysical pointers. These file organizations typically assign an area  of the disk to \\nhold records of more than one type so that records of different types can be \\n physically clustered  on disk. If a particular relationship is expected to be used \\n frequently, implementing the relationship physically can increase the system’s  efficiency at retrieving related records. For example, if the query to retrieve a \\nDEPARTMENT  record and all records for STUDENT s majoring in that department is \\nfrequent, it would be desirable to place each DEPARTMENT  record and its cluster of \\nSTUDENT  records contiguously on disk in a mixed file. The concept of physical \\nclustering  of object types is used in object DBMSs to store related objects together \\nin a mixed file. In data warehouses (see Chapter 29), the input data comes from a \\nvariety of sources and undergoes an integration initially to collect the required data \\ninto an operational data store (ODS) . An ODS typically contains files where \\nrecords of multiple types are kept together. It is passed on to a data warehouse after ETL  (extract, transform and load) processing operations are performed on it.\\nTo distinguish the records in a mixed file, each record has—in addition to its field \\nvalues—a record type  field, which specifies the type of record. This is typically the \\nfirst field in each record and is used by the system software to determine the type of \\nrecord it is about to process. Using the catalog information, the DBMS can deter-\\nmine the fields of that record type and their sizes, in order to interpret the data \\nvalues in the record.\\n16.9.2  B-Trees and Other Data Structures  \\nas Primary Organization\\nOther data structures can be used for primary file organizations. For example, if \\nboth the record size and the number of records in a file are small, some DBMSs offer the option of a B-tree data structure as the primary file organization. We will describe B-trees in Section 17.3.1, when we discuss the use of the B-tree data structure for indexing. In general, any data structure that can be adapted to the characteristics of disk devices can be used as a primary file organization for record placement on disk. Recently, column-based storage of data has been pro-posed as a primary method for storage of relations in relational databases. We will briefly introduce it in Chapter 17 as a possible alternative storage scheme for relational databases.'),\n",

To match this growth, it is natural to expect that secondary storage technology must also take steps to keep up with pro-cessor technology in performance and reliability.\\nA major advance in secondary storage technology is represented by the develop-\\nment of RAID , which originally stood for redundant arrays of inexpensive disks . \\nMore recently, the I in RAID is said to stand for independent . The RAID idea \\nreceived a very positive industry endorsement and has been developed into an elab-orate set of alternative RAID architectures (RAID levels 0 through 6). We highlight the main features of the technology in this section.\\nThe main goal of RAID is to even out the widely different rates of performance \\nimprovement of disks against those in memory and microprocessors.\\n17 Although \\nRAM capacities have quadrupled every two to three years, disk access times  are \\nimproving at less than 10% per year, and disk transfer rates  are improving at roughly \\n20% per year. Disk capacities  are indeed improving at more than 50% per year, but \\nthe speed and access time improvements are of a much smaller magnitude.\\nA second qualitative disparity exists between the ability of special microprocessors \\nthat cater to new applications involving video, audio, image, and spatial data pro-cessing (see Chapters 26 for details of these applications), with corresponding lack of fast access to large, shared data sets.\\nThe natural solution is a large array of small independent disks acting as a single \\nhigher performance logical disk. A concept called data striping is used, which utilizes parallelism  to improve disk performance. Data striping  distributes data transpar-\\nently over multiple disks to make them appear as a single large, fast disk. Figure 16.13 shows a file distributed or striped  over four disks. In bit-level striping , a byte is \\nsplit and individual bits are stored on independent disks. Figure 16.13(a) illustrates bit-striping across four disks where the bits (0, 4) are assigned to disk 0, bits (1, 5) to disk 1, and so on. With this striping, every disk participates in every read or write operation; the number of accesses per second would remain the same as on a single disk, but the amount of data read in a given time would increase fourfold. Thus, striping improves overall I/O performance by providing high overall transfer rates. Block-level striping  stripes blocks across disks. It treats the array of disks as if it is \\none disk. Blocks are logically numbered from 0 in sequence. Disks in an m-disk array \\nare numbered 0 to m – 1. With striping, block j goes to disk (j mod m). Figure \\n16.13(b) illustrates block striping with four disks ( m = 4). Data striping also accom-\\nplishes load balancing among disks. Moreover, by storing redundant information on \\n17This was predicted by Gordon Bell to be about 40% every year between 1974 and 1984 and is now \\nsupposed to exceed 50% per year.'),\n",

Section 16.10.3 discusses RAID organizations and levels.\\n16.10.1 Improving Reliability with RAID\\nFor an array of n disks, the likelihood of failure is n times as much as that for one \\ndisk. Hence, if the MTBF (mean time between failures) of a disk drive is assumed to be 200,000 hours or about 22.8 years (for the disk drive in Table 16.1 called Seagate Enterprise Performance 10K HDD, it is 1.4 million hours), the MTBF for a bank of 100 disk drives becomes only 2,000 hours or 83.3 days (for a bank of 1,000 Seagate Enterprise Performance 10K HDD disks it would be 1,400 hours or 58.33 days). Keeping a single copy of data in such an array of disks will cause a significant loss of reliability. An obvious solution is to employ redundancy of data so that disk failures can be tolerated. The disadvantages are many: additional I/O operations for write, extra computation to maintain redundancy and to do recovery from errors, and additional disk capacity to store redundant information.\\nOne technique for introducing redundancy is called mirroring  or shadowing . \\nData is written redundantly to two identical physical disks that are treated as one logical disk. When data is read, it can be retrieved from the disk with shorter queuing, seek, and rotational delays. If a disk fails, the other disk is used until the first is repaired. Suppose the mean time to repair is 24 hours; then the mean time to data loss of a mirrored disk system using 100 disks with MTBF of 200,000 \\nhours each is (200,000)\\n2/(2 * 24) = 8.33 * 108 hours, which is 95,028 years.18 Disk \\nmirroring also doubles the rate at which read requests are handled, since a read can go to either disk. The transfer rate of each read, however, remains the same as that for a single disk.(a) Disk 0A0 | A4\\nB0 | B4\\nDisk 1A1 | A5\\nB1 | B5\\nDisk 2A2 | A6\\nB2 | B6\\nDisk 3A3 | A7\\nB3 | B7\\nDisk 0A1\\nDisk 1A2\\nDisk 2A3\\nDisk 3A4A0 | A1 | A2 | A3 | A4 | A5 | A6 | A7\\nB0 | B1 | B2 | B3 | B4 | B5 | B6 | B7\\nData\\nBlock A1File A:\\n(b)Block A2Block A3Block A4Figure 16.13 \\nStriping of data across multiple disks.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 616}, page_content='586 Chapter 16 Disk Storage, Basic File Structures, Hashing, and Modern Storage Architectures\\nAnother solution to the problem of reliability is to store extra information that is not \\nnormally needed but that can be used to reconstruct the lost information in case of disk failure. The incorporation of redundancy must consider two problems: select-ing a technique for computing the redundant information, and selecting a method of distributing the redundant information across the disk array. The first problem is addressed by using error-correcting codes involving parity bits, or specialized codes such as Hamming codes. Under the parity scheme, a redundant disk may be consid-ered as having the sum of all the data in the other disks. When a disk fails, the miss-ing information can be constructed by a process similar to subtraction.\\nFor the second problem, the two major approaches are either to store the redun-\\ndant information on a small number of disks or to distribute it uniformly across all disks. The latter results in better load balancing. The different levels of RAID choose a combination of these options to implement redundancy and improve reliability.\\n16.10.2 Improving Performance with RAID\\nThe disk arrays employ the technique of data striping to achieve higher transfer rates. Note that data can be read or written only one block at a time, so a typical transfer contains 512 to 8,192 bytes. Disk striping may be applied at a finer granu-larity by breaking up a byte of data into bits and spreading the bits to different disks. Thus, bit-level data striping  consists of splitting a byte of data and writing \\nbit j to the jth disk. With 8-bit bytes, eight physical disks may be considered as one \\nlogical disk with an eightfold increase in the data transfer rate. Each disk partici-\\npates in each I/O request and the total amount of data read per request is eight \\ntimes as much. Bit-level striping can be generalized to a number of disks that is \\neither a multiple or a factor of eight. Thus, in a four-disk array, bit n goes to the disk \\nwhich is ( n mod 4). Figure 16.13(a) shows bit-level striping of data.\\nThe granularity of data interleaving can be higher than a bit; for example, blocks of \\na file can be striped across disks, giving rise to block-level striping . Figure 16.13(b) \\nshows block-level data striping assuming the data file contains four blocks. With block-level striping, multiple independent requests that access single blocks (small requests) can be serviced in parallel by separate disks, thus decreasing the queuing time of I/O requests. Requests that access multiple blocks (large requests) can be parallelized, thus reducing their response time. In general, the more the number of disks in an array, the larger the potential performance benefit. However, assuming independent failures, the disk array of 100 disks collectively has 1/100th the reli-ability of a single disk. Thus, redundancy via error-correcting codes and disk mir-roring is necessary to provide reliability along with high performance.\\n16.10.3 RAID Organizations and Levels\\nDifferent RAID organizations were defined based on different combinations of the two factors of granularity of data interleaving (striping) and pattern used to com-pute redundant information. In the initial proposal, levels 1 through 5 of RAID were proposed, and two additional levels—0 and 6—were added later.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 617}, page_content='16.10 Parallelizing Disk Access Using RAID Technology  587\\nRAID level 0 uses data striping, has no redundant data, and hence has the best write \\nperformance since updates do not have to be duplicated. It splits data evenly across two or more disks. However, its read performance is not as good as RAID level 1, which uses mirrored disks. In the latter, performance improvement is possible by scheduling a read request to the disk with shortest expected seek and rotational delay. RAID level 2 uses memory-style redundancy by using Hamming codes, which contain parity bits for distinct overlapping subsets of components. Thus, in one particular version of this level, three redundant disks suffice for four original disks, whereas with mirroring—as in level 1—four would be required. Level 2 includes both error detection and correction, although detection is generally not required because broken disks identify themselves.\\nRAID level 3 uses a single parity disk relying on the disk controller to figure out \\nwhich disk has failed. Levels 4 and 5 use block-level data striping, with level 5 dis-tributing data and parity information across all disks. Figure 16.14(b) shows an illustration of RAID level 5, where parity is shown with subscript p. If one disk fails, the missing data is calculated based on the parity available from the remaining disks. Finally, RAID level 6 applies the so-called P + Q redundancy scheme using \\nReed-Soloman codes to protect against up to two disk failures by using just two redundant disks.\\nRebuilding in case of disk failure is easiest for RAID level 1. Other levels require \\nthe reconstruction of a failed disk by reading multiple disks. Level 1 is used for critical applications such as storing logs of transactions. Levels 3 and 5 are pre-ferred for large volume storage, with level 3 providing higher transfer rates. Most popular use of RAID technology currently uses level 0 (with striping), level 1 (with mirroring), and level 5 with an extra drive for parity. A combination of multiple RAID levels are also used—for example, 0 + 1 combines striping and mirroring \\nDisk 0 Disk 1\\nA1\\nB1\\nC1\\nDpA2\\nB2\\nCp\\nD1A3\\nBp\\nC2\\nD2Ap\\nB3\\nC3\\nD3(a)\\n(b)File A\\nFile B\\nFile C\\nFile DFile A\\nFile B\\nFile C\\nFile D\\nFigure 16.14 \\nSome popular levels of RAID. \\n(a) RAID level 1: Mirroring of \\ndata on two disks.

Other nonstandard RAID levels include: RAID 1.5, \\nRAID 7, RAID-DP, RAID S or Parity RAID, Matrix RAID, RAID-K, RAID-Z, RAIDn, Linux MD RAID 10, IBM ServeRAID 1E, and unRAID. A discussion of these nonstandard levels is beyond the scope of this text. Designers of a RAID setup for a given application mix have to confront many design decisions such as the level of RAID, the number of disks, the choice of parity schemes, and grouping of disks for block-level striping. Detailed performance studies on small reads and writes (referring to I/O requests for one striping unit) and large reads and writes (referring to I/O requests for one stripe unit from each disk in an error-correction group) have been performed.\\n16.11 Modern Storage Architectures\\nIn this section, we describe some recent developments in storage systems that are \\nbecoming an integral part of most enterprise’s information system architectures. We already mentioned the SATA and SAS interface, which has almost replaced the previously popular SCSI (small computer system interface) in laptops and small servers. The Fibre Channel (FC) interface is the predominant choice for storage networks in data centers. We review some of the modern storage architectures next.\\n16.11.1 Storage Area Networks\\nWith the rapid growth of electronic commerce, enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems that integrate application data across organizations, and data warehouses that keep historical aggregate information (see Chapter 29), the demand for storage has gone up substantially. For today’s Internet-driven organizations, it has become necessary to move from a static fixed data center-oriented operation to a more flex-ible and dynamic infrastructure for the organizations’ information processing requirements. The total cost of managing all data is growing so rapidly that in many instances the cost of managing server-attached storage exceeds the cost of the server itself. Furthermore, the procurement cost of storage is only a small fraction—typi-cally, only 10 to 15% of the overall cost of storage management. Many users of RAID systems cannot use the capacity effectively because it has to be attached in a fixed manner to one or more servers. Therefore, most large organizations have moved to a concept called storage area networks (SANs) . In a SAN, online storage \\nperipherals are configured as nodes on a high-speed network and can be attached and detached from servers in a very flexible manner.\\nSeveral companies have emerged as SAN providers and supply their own proprie-\\ntary topologies. They allow storage systems to be placed at longer distances from the servers and provide different performance and connectivity options. Existing storage management applications can be ported into SAN configurations using Fibre Channel networks that encapsulate the legacy SCSI protocol. As a result, the SAN-attached devices appear as SCSI devices.\\nCurrent architectural alternatives for SAN include the following: point-to-point \\nconnections between servers and storage systems via Fiber Channel; use of a Fiber'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 619}, page_content='16.11 Modern Storage Architectures  589\\nChannel switch to connect multiple RAID systems, tape libraries, and so on to serv-\\ners; and the use of Fiber Channel hubs and switches to connect servers and storage systems in different configurations. Organizations can slowly move up from sim-pler topologies to more complex ones by adding servers and storage devices as needed. We do not provide further details here because they vary among SAN ven-dors. The main advantages claimed include:\\n ■Flexible many-to-many connectivity among servers and storage devices \\nusing Fiber Channel hubs and switches\\n ■Up to 10 km separation between a server and a storage system using appro-\\npriate fiber optic cables\\n ■Better isolation capabilities allowing nondisruptive addition of new periph-\\nerals and servers\\n ■High-speed data replication across multiple storage systems. Typical tech-\\nnologies use synchronous replication for local and asynchronous replication for disaster recovery (DR) solutions.\\nSANs are growing very rapidly but are still faced with many problems, such as com-\\nbining storage options from multiple vendors and dealing with evolving standards \\nof storage management software and hardware. Most major companies are evaluat-\\ning SANs as a viable option for database storage.\\n16.11.2 Network-Attached Storage\\nWith the phenomenal growth in digital data, particularly generated from multi-media and other enterprise applications, the need for high-performance storage \\nsolutions at low cost has become extremely important. Network-attached storage  \\n(NAS) devices are among the storage devices being used for this purpose. These devices are, in fact, servers that do not provide any of the common server services, but simply allow the addition of storage for file sharing . NAS devices allow vast \\namounts of hard-disk storage space to be added to a network and can make that space available to multiple servers without shutting them down for maintenance and upgrades. NAS devices can reside anywhere on a local area network (LAN) and may be combined in different configurations. A single hardware device, often called the NAS box  or NAS head , acts as the interface between the NAS system and net-\\nwork clients. These NAS devices require no monitor, keyboard, or mouse. One or more disk or tape drives can be attached to many NAS systems to increase total capacity. Clients connect to the NAS head rather than to the individual storage devices. A NAS can store any data that appears in the form of files, such as e-mail boxes, Web content, remote system backups, and so on. In that sense, NAS devices \\nare being deployed as a replacement for traditional file servers.\\nNAS systems strive for reliable operation and easy administration. They include \\nbuilt-in features such as secure authentication, or the automatic sending of e-mail alerts in case of error on the device. The NAS devices (or appliances , as some ven-\\ndors refer to them) are being offered with a high degree of scalability, reliability,'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 620}, page_content='590 Chapter 16 Disk Storage, Basic File Structures, Hashing, and Modern Storage Architectures\\nflexibility, and performance. Such devices typically support RAID levels 0, 1, and 5. \\nTraditional storage area networks (SANs) differ from NAS in several ways. Specifi-cally, SANs often utilize Fibre Channel rather than Ethernet, and a SAN often incorporates multiple network devices or endpoints  on a self-contained or private  \\nLAN, whereas NAS relies on individual devices connected directly to the existing public LAN. Whereas Windows, UNIX, and NetWare file servers each demand specific protocol support on the client side, NAS systems claim greater operating system independence of clients. In summary, NAS provides a file system interface with support for networked files using protocols such as common internet file sys-tem (CIFS) or network file system (NFS).\\n16.11.3 iSCSI and Other Network-Based Storage Protocols\\nA new protocol called iSCSI  (Internet SCSI) has been proposed recently. It is a \\nblock-storage protocol like SAN. It allows clients (called initiators ) to send SCSI \\ncommands to SCSI storage devices on remote channels. The main advantage of iSCSI is that it does not require the special cabling needed by Fibre Channel and it can run over longer distances using existing network infrastructure. By carrying SCSI commands over IP networks, iSCSI facilitates data transfers over intranets and manages storage over long distances. It can transfer data over local area net-works (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), or the Internet.\\niSCSI works as follows. When a DBMS needs to access data, the operating system \\ngenerates the appropriate SCSI commands and data request, which then go through \\nencapsulation and, if necessary, encryption procedures. A packet header is added \\nbefore the resulting IP packets are transmitted over an Ethernet connection. When \\na packet is received, it is decrypted (if it was encrypted before transmission) and disassembled, separating the SCSI commands and request. The SCSI commands go via the SCSI controller to the SCSI storage device. Because iSCSI is bidirectional, the protocol can also be used to return data in response to the original request. Cisco and IBM have marketed switches and routers based on this technology.\\n iSCSI storage  has mainly impacted small- and medium-sized businesses because \\nof its combination of simplicity, low cost, and the functionality of iSCSI devices. It allows them not to learn the ins and outs of Fibre Channel (FC) technology and instead benefit from their familiarity with the IP protocol and Ethernet hardware. iSCSI implementations in the data centers of very large enterprise businesses are slow in development due to their prior investment in Fibre Channel–based SANs.\\niSCSI is one of two main approaches to storage data transmission over IP networks. \\nThe other method, Fibre Channel over IP (FCIP) , translates Fibre Channel control \\ncodes and data into IP packets for transmission between geographically distant Fibre Channel storage area networks. This protocol, known also as Fibre Channel \\ntunneling  or storage tunneling , can only be used in conjunction with Fibre Channel \\ntechnology, whereas iSCSI can run over existing Ethernet networks.\\nThe latest idea to enter the enterprise IP storage race is Fibre Channel over \\n Ethernet (FCoE) , which can be thought of as iSCSI without the IP. It uses many'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 621}, page_content='16.11 Modern Storage Architectures  591\\nelements of SCSI and FC (just like iSCSI), but it does not include TCP/IP compo-\\nnents. FCoE has been successfully productized by CISCO (termed “Data Center Ethernet”) and Brocade. It takes advantage of a reliable ethernet technology that uses buffering and end-to-end flow control to avoid dropped packets. This prom-ises excellent performance, especially on 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10GbE), and is  relatively easy for vendors to add to their products.\\n16.11.4 Automated Storage Tiering\\nAnother trend in storage is automated storage tiering (AST), which automati-cally moves data between different storage types such as SATA, SAS, and solid-state drives (SSDs) depending on the need. The storage administrator can set up a tiering policy in which less frequently used data is moved to slower and cheaper SATA drives and more frequently used data is moved up to solid-state drives (see Table \\xa016.1 for the various tiers of storage ordered by increasing speed of access). This automated tiering can improve database performance tremendously.\\nEMC has an implementation of this technology called FAST (fully automated stor-\\nage tiering) that does continuous monitoring of data activity and takes actions to move the data to the appropriate tier based on the policy.\\n16.11.5 Object-Based Storage\\nDuring the last few years, there have been major developments in terms of rapid growth of the cloud concept, distributed architectures for databases and for analyt-ics, and development of data-intensive applications on the Web (see Chapters 23, 24, and 25). These developments have caused fundamental changes in enterprise storage infrastructure. The hardware-oriented file-based systems are evolving into new open-ended architectures for storage. The latest among these is object-based storage. Under this scheme, data is managed in the form of objects rather than files made of blocks. Objects carry metadata that contains properties that can be used for managing those objects. Each object carries a unique global identifier that is used to locate it. Object storage has its origins in research projects at CMU (Gibson et al., 1996) on scaling up of network attached storage and in the Oceanstore system at UC Berkeley (Kubiatowicz et al., 2000), which attempted to build a global infra-structure over all forms of trusted and untrusted servers for continuous access to persistent data. There is no need to do lower level storage operations in terms of capacity management or making decisions like what type of RAID architecture should be used for fault protection.\\nObject storage also allows additional flexibility in terms of interfaces—it gives con-\\ntrol to applications that can control the objects directly and also allows the objects to be addressable across a wide namespace spanning multiple devices. Replication and distribution of objects is also supported. In general, object storage is ideally suited for scalable storage of massive amounts of unstructured data such as Web pages, images, and audio/video clips and files. Object-based storage device com-mands (OSDs) were proposed as part of SCSI protocol a long time ago but did not'),\n",

Currently, Facebook uses an object storage system to store pho-tos at the level of over 350 Petabytes of storage; Spotify uses an object storage sys-tem for storing songs; and Dropbox uses it for its storage infrastructure. Object storage is the choice of many cloud offerings, such as Amazon’s AWS (Amazon Web Service) S3, and Microsoft’s Azure, which stores files, relations, messages, and so on as objects. Other examples of products include Hitachi’s HCP, EMC’s Atmos, and Scality’s RING. Openstack Swift is an open source project that allows one to use HTTP GET and PUT to retrieve and store objects—that’s basically the whole API. Openstack Swift uses very cheap hardware, is fully fault resistant, automati-cally takes advantage of geographic redundancy, and scales to very large numbers of objects. Since object storage forces locking to occur at the object level, it is not clear how suitable it is for concurrent transaction processing in high-throughput \\ntransaction-oriented systems. Therefore, it is still not considered viable for main-stream enterprise-level database applications.\\n16.12  Summary\\nWe began this chapter by discussing the characteristics of memory hierarchies and then concentrated on secondary storage devices. In particular, we focused on mag-netic disks because they are still the preferred medium to store online database files. Table 16.1 presented a perspective on the memory hierarchies and their current capacities, access speeds, transfer rates, and costs.\\nData on disk is stored in blocks; accessing a disk block is expensive because of the \\nseek time, rotational delay, and block transfer time. To reduce the average block \\naccess time, double buffering can be used when accessing consecutive disk blocks. (Other disk parameters are discussed in Appendix B.) We introduced the various interface technologies in use today for disk drives and optical devices. We presented \\na list of strategies employed to improve access of data from disks. We also intro-\\nduced solid-state drives, which are rapidly becoming popular, and optical drives, \\nwhich are mainly used as tertiary storage. We discussed the working of the buffer manager, which is responsible for handling data requests and we presented various buffer replacement policies. We presented different ways of storing file records on disk. File records are grouped into disk blocks and can be fixed length or variable length, spanned or unspanned, and of the same record type or mixed types. We dis-cussed the file header, which describes the record formats and keeps track of the disk addresses of the file blocks. Information in the file header is used by system software accessing the file records.\\nThen we presented a set of typical commands for accessing individual file records \\nand discussed the concept of the current record of a file. We discussed how com-plex record search conditions are transformed into simple search conditions that are used to locate records in the file.\\nThree primary file organizations were then discussed: unordered, ordered, and \\nhashed. Unordered files require a linear search to locate records, but record'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 623}, page_content='Review Questions  593\\ninsertion is very simple. We discussed the deletion problem and the use of dele-\\ntion markers.\\nOrdered files shorten the time required to read records in order of the ordering \\nfield. The time required to search for an arbitrary record, given the value of its ordering key field, is also reduced if a binary search is used. However, maintaining the records in order makes insertion very expensive; thus the technique of using an unordered overflow file to reduce the cost of record insertion was discussed. Over-flow records are merged with the master file periodically, and deleted records are physically dropped during file reorganization.\\nHashing provides very fast access to an arbitrary record of a file, given the value of \\nits hash key. The most suitable method for external hashing is the bucket technique, with one or more contiguous blocks corresponding to each bucket. Collisions caus-ing bucket overflow are handled by open addressing, chaining, or multiple hashing. Access on any nonhash field is slow, and so is ordered access of the records on any field. We discussed three hashing techniques for files that grow and shrink in the number of records dynamically: extendible, dynamic, and linear hashing. The first two use the higher-order bits of the hash address to organize a directory. Linear hashing is geared to keep the load factor of the file within a given range and adds new buckets linearly.\\nWe briefly discussed other possibilities for primary file storage and organization, \\nsuch as B-trees, and files of mixed records, which implement relationships among records of different types physically as part of the storage structure. We reviewed the recent advances in disk technology represented by RAID (redundant arrays of inexpensive (or independent) disks), which has become a standard technique in large enterprises to provide better reliability and fault tolerance features in storage. Finally, we reviewed some modern trends in enterprise storage systems: storage area networks (SANs), network-attached storage (NAS), iSCSI and other network based protocols, automatic storage tiering, and finally object-based storage, which is playing a major role in storage architecture of data centers offering cloud-based services.\\nReview Questions\\n 16.1.

We will describe additional auxiliary access structures  called indexes , which are used to \\nspeed up the retrieval of records in response to certain search conditions. The index structures are additional files on disk that provide secondary access paths , which \\nprovide alternative ways to access the records without affecting the physical place-ment of records in the primary data file on disk. They enable efficient access to records based on the indexing fields  that are used to construct the index. Basically, \\nany field  of the file can be used to create an index, and multiple indexes  on different \\nfields—as well as indexes on multiple fields —can be constructed on the same file. A \\nvariety of indexes are possible; each of them uses a particular data structure to speed up the search. To find a record or records in the data file based on a search condi-tion on an indexing field, the index is searched, which leads to pointers to one or more disk blocks in the data file where the required records are located. The most prevalent types of indexes are based on ordered files (single-level indexes) and use tree data structures (multilevel indexes, B\\n+-trees) to organize the index. Indexes can \\nalso be constructed based on hashing or other search data structures. We also dis-cuss indexes that are vectors of bits called bitmap indexes .\\nWe describe different types of single-level ordered indexes—primary, secondary, \\nand clustering—in Section 17.1. By viewing a single-level index as an ordered file, one can develop additional indexes for it, giving rise to the concept of multilevel indexes. A popular indexing scheme called ISAM (indexed sequential access \\nmethod)  is based on this idea. We discuss multilevel tree-structured indexes in Sec-\\ntion 17.2. In Section 17.3, we describe B-trees and B\\n+-trees, which are data struc-\\ntures that are commonly used in DBMSs to implement dynamically changing chapter 17'),\n",

B+-trees have become a commonly accepted default structure \\nfor generating indexes on demand in most relational DBMSs. Section 17.4 is devoted to alternative ways to access data based on a combination of multiple keys. In Sec-tion 17.5, we discuss hash indexes and introduce the concept of logical indexes, which give an additional level of indirection from physical indexes and allow the physical index to be flexible and extensible in its organization. In Section 17.6, we discuss multikey indexing and bitmap indexes used for searching on one or more keys. Section 17.7 covers physical design and Section 7.8 summarizes the chapter.\\n17.1 Types of Single-Level Ordered Indexes\\nThe idea behind an ordered index is similar to that behind the index used in a text-book, which lists important terms at the end of the book in alphabetical order along with a list of page numbers where the term appears in the book. We can search the book index for a certain term in the textbook to find a list of addresses— page num-\\nbers in this case—and use these addresses to locate the specified pages first and then search  for the term on each specified page. The alternative, if no other guidance is \\ngiven, would be to sift slowly through the whole textbook word by word to find the term we are interested in; this corresponds to doing a linear search , which scans the \\nwhole file. Of course, most books do have additional information, such as chapter \\nand section titles, which help us find a term without having to search through the \\nwhole book. However, the index is the only exact indication of the pages where each \\nterm occurs in the book.\\nFor a file with a given record structure consisting of several fields (or attributes), an \\nindex access structure is usually defined on a single field of a file, called an indexing \\nfield  (or indexing attribute ).\\n1 The index typically stores each value of the index field \\nalong with a list of pointers to all disk blocks that contain records with that field value. The values in the index are ordered  so that we can do a binary search  on the \\nindex. If both the data file and the index file are ordered, and since the index file is typically much smaller than the data file, searching the index using a binary search is a better option. Tree-structured multilevel indexes (see Section 17.2) implement an extension of the binary search idea that reduces the search space by two-way partitioning at each search step to an n-ary partitioning approach that divides the \\nsearch space in the file n-ways at each stage.\\nThere are several types of ordered indexes. A primary index  is specified on the \\nordering key field  of an ordered file  of records. Recall from Section 16.7 that an \\nordering key field is used to physically order  the file records on disk, and every \\nrecord has a unique value  for that field. If the ordering field is not a key field—that \\nis, if numerous records in the file can have the same value for the ordering field—another type of index, called a clustering index , can be used. The data file is called \\na clustered file  in this latter case. Notice that a file can have at most one physical \\nordering field, so it can have at most one primary index or one clustering index, but \\n1We use the terms field and attribute  interchangeably in this chapter.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 633}, page_content='17.1 Types of Single-Level Ordered Indexes  603\\nnot both . A third type of index, called a secondary index , can be specified on any \\nnonordering  field of a file. A data file can have several secondary indexes in addition \\nto its primary access method. We discuss these types of single-level indexes in the next three subsections.\\n17.1.1 Primary Indexes\\nA primary index  is an ordered file whose records are of fixed length with two \\nfields, and it acts like an access structure to efficiently search for and access the data records in a data file. The first field is of the same data type as the ordering key field—called the primary key —of the data file, and the second field is a \\npointer to a disk block (a block address). There is one index entry  (or index \\nrecord ) in the index file for each block  in the data file. Each index entry has the \\nvalue of the primary key field for the first record in a block and a pointer to that \\nblock as its two field values. We will refer to the two field values of index entry i as \\n<K(i), P(i)>. In the rest of this chapter, we refer to different types of index entries  \\n< K (i), X > as follows:\\n ■X may be the physical address of a block (or page) in the file, as in the case of \\nP(i) above.\\n ■X may be the record address made up of a block address and a record id (or \\noffset) within the block.\\n ■X may be a logical address of the block or of the record within the file and is \\na relative number that would be mapped to a physical address (see further explanation in Section 17.6.1).\\nTo create a primary index on the ordered file shown in Figure 16.7, we use the \\nName  \\nfield as primary key, because that is the ordering key field of the file (assuming that each value of \\nName  is unique). Each entry in the index has a Name  value and a \\npointer. The first three index entries are as follows:\\n<K(1) = (Aaron, Ed), P(1) = address of block 1>\\n<K(2) = (Adams, John), P(2) = address of block 2>\\n<K(3) = (Alexander, Ed), P(3) = address of block 3>\\nFigure 17.1 illustrates this primary index. The total number of entries in the index is \\nthe same as the number of disk blocks  in the ordered data file. The first record in \\neach block of the data file is called the anchor record  of the block, or simply the \\nblock anchor .2\\nIndexes can also be characterized as dense or sparse. A dense index  has an index \\nentry for every search key value  (and hence every record) in the data file. A sparse  \\n(or nondense ) index , on the other hand, has index entries for only some of the \\nsearch values. A sparse index has fewer entries than the number of records in the file. Thus, a primary index is a nondense (sparse) index, since it includes an \\n2We can use a scheme similar to the one described here, with the last record in each block (rather than \\nthe first) as the block anchor. This slightly improves the efficiency of the search algorithm.'),\n",

First, there are fewer index entries  than there are records in the \\ndata file. Second, each index entry is typically smaller in size  than a data record \\nbecause it has only two fields, both of which tend to be short in size; consequently, more index entries than data records can fit in one block. Therefore, a binary search on the index file requires fewer block accesses than a binary search on the data file. Referring to Table 16.3, note that the binary search for an ordered data file required log\\n2b block accesses. But if the primary index file contains only bi blocks, then to \\nlocate a record with a search key value requires a binary search of that index and access to the block containing that record: a total of log\\n2bi + 1 accesses.\\nA record whose primary key value is K lies in the block whose address is P(i), where \\nK(i) ≤ K < K(i + 1). The ith block in the data file contains all such records because of \\nthe physical ordering of the file records on the primary key field. To retrieve a record, given the value K of its primary key field, we do a binary search on the index \\nfile to find the appropriate index entry i, and then retrieve the data file block whose \\naddress is P(i).\\n4 Example 1 illustrates the saving in block accesses that is attainable \\nwhen a primary index is used to search for a record.\\nExample 1. Suppose that we have an ordered file with r = 300,000 records stored on \\na disk with block size B = 4,096 bytes.5 File records are of fixed size and are unspanned, \\nwith record length R = 100 bytes. The blocking factor for the file would be \\nbfr = ⎣(B/R)⎦ = ⎣(4,096/100) ⎦ = 40 records per block. The number of blocks needed \\nfor the file is b = ⎡(r/bfr)⎤ = ⎡(300,000/40) ⎤ = 7,500 blocks. A binary search on the data \\nfile would need approximately ⎡log2 b⎤= ⎡(log 2 7,500) ⎤ = 13 block accesses.\\nNow suppose that the ordering key field of the file is V = 9 bytes long, a block pointer \\nis P = 6 bytes long, and we have constructed a primary index for the file. The size of \\neach index entry is Ri = (9 + 6) = 15 bytes, so the blocking factor for the index is  \\nbfri = ⎣(B/Ri)⎦ = ⎣(4,096/15) ⎦ = 273 entries per block. The total number of index \\nentries ri is equal to the number of blocks in the data file, which is 7,500. The number \\nof index blocks is hence bi = ⎡(ri/bfri)⎤ = ⎡(7,500/273) ⎤ = 28 blocks. To perform a \\nbinary search on the index file would need ⎡(log 2 bi)⎤ = ⎡(log 2 28)⎤ = 5 block accesses. \\nTo search for a record using the index, we need one additional block access to the data file for a total of 5 + 1 = 6 block accesses—an improvement over binary search on the data file, which required 13 disk block accesses. Note that the index with 7,500 entries of 15 bytes each is rather small (112,500 or 112.5 Kbytes) and would typically be kept in main memory thus requiring negligible time to search with binary search. In that case we simply make one block access to retrieve the record.\\n3The sparse primary index has been called clustered (primary) index in some books and articles.\\n4Notice that the above formula would not be correct if the data file were ordered on a nonkey field ; in that \\ncase the same index value in the block anchor could be repeated in the last records of the previous block.\\n5Most DBMS vendors, including Oracle, are using 4K or 4,096 bytes as a standard block/page size.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 636}, page_content='606 Chapter 17 Indexing Structures for Files and Physical Database Design\\nA major problem with a primary index—as with any ordered file—is insertion and \\ndeletion of records. With a primary index, the problem is compounded because if we attempt to insert a record in its correct position in the data file, we must not only move records to make space for the new record but also change some index entries, since moving records will change the anchor records  of some blocks. Using \\nan unordered overflow file, as discussed in Section 16.7, can reduce this problem. Another possibility is to use a linked list of overflow records for each block in the data file. This is similar to the method of dealing with overflow records described with hashing in Section 16.8.2. Records within each block and its overflow linked list can be sorted to improve retrieval time. Record deletion is handled using dele-tion markers.\\n17.1.2 Clustering Indexes\\nIf file records are physically ordered on a nonkey field—which does not  have a dis-\\ntinct value for each record—that field is called the clustering field  and the data file \\nis called a clustered file.  We can create a different type of index, called a clustering \\nindex , to speed up retrieval of all the records that have the same value for the clus-\\ntering field. This differs from a primary index, which requires that the ordering field of the data file have a distinct value  for each record.\\nA clustering index is also an ordered file with two fields; the first field is of the \\nsame type as the clustering field of the data file, and the second field is a disk block pointer. There is one entry in the clustering index for each distinct value  of the \\nclustering field, and it contains the value and a pointer to the first block  in the data \\nfile that has a record with that value for its clustering field. Figure 17.2 shows an example. Notice that record insertion and deletion still cause problems because the data records are physically ordered. To alleviate the problem of insertion, it is common to reserve a whole block (or a cluster of contiguous blocks) for each value  \\nof the clustering field; all records with that value are placed in the block (or block cluster). This makes insertion and deletion relatively straightforward. Figure 17.3 shows this scheme.\\nA clustering index is another example of a nondense  index because it has an entry \\nfor every distinct value  of the indexing field, which is a nonkey by definition and \\nhence has duplicate values rather than a unique value for every record in the file.\\nExample 2. Suppose that we consider the same ordered file with r = 300,000 \\nrecords stored on a disk with block size B = 4,096 bytes. Imagine that it is ordered by \\nthe attribute Zipcode and there are 1,000 zip codes in the file (with an average 300 records per zip code, assuming even distri bution across zip codes.) The index in this \\ncase has 1,000 index entries of 11 bytes each (5-byte Zipcode and 6-byte block \\npointer) with a blocking factor bfr\\ni = ⎣(B/Ri)⎦ = ⎣(4,096/11) ⎦ = 372 index entries per \\nblock. The number of index blocks is hence bi = ⎡(ri/bfri)⎤ = ⎡(1,000/372) ⎤ = 3 blocks. \\nTo perform a binary search on the index file would need ⎡(log 2 bi)⎤ = ⎡(log 2 3)⎤ = 2 \\nblock accesses. Again, this index would typically be loaded in main memory (occu-\\npies 11,000 or 11 Kbytes) and takes negligible time to search in memory. One block \\naccess to the data file would lead to the first record with a given zip code.'),\n",

The data file records could be ordered, unor-dered, or hashed. The secondary index may be created on a field that is a candidate key and has a unique value in every record, or on a nonkey field with duplicate values. The index is again an ordered file with two fields. The first field is of the same data type as some nonordering field  of the data file that is an indexing field . \\nThe second field is either a block  pointer or a record  pointer. Many  secondary \\nindexes (and hence, indexing fields) can be created for the same file—each repre-sents an additional means of accessing that file based on some specific field.\\nFirst we consider a secondary index access structure on a key (unique) field that has a \\ndistinct value  for every record. Such a field is sometimes called a secondary  key; in the \\nrelational model, this would correspond to any \\nUNIQUE  key attribute or to the primary \\nkey attribute of a table. In this case there is one index entry for each record  in the data \\nfile, which contains the value of the field for the record and a pointer either to the block in which the record is stored or to the record itself. Hence, such an index is dense .\\nAgain we refer to the two field values of index entry i as < K(i), P(i)>. The entries are \\nordered  by value of K(i), so we can perform a binary search. Because the records of \\nthe data file are not physically ordered by values of the secondary key field, we cannot  \\nuse block anchors. That is why an index entry is created for each record in the data file, rather than for each block, as in the case of a primary index. Figure 17.4 illustrates a secondary index in which the pointers P(i) in the index entries are block pointers,  \\nnot record pointers. Once the appropriate disk block is transferred to a main memory buffer, a search for the desired record within the block can be carried out.\\nA secondary index usually needs more storage space and longer search time than \\ndoes a primary index, because of its larger number of entries. However, the improve-\\nment  in search time for an arbitrary record is much greater for a secondary index \\nthan for a primary index, since we would have to do a linear search  on the data file \\nif the secondary index did not exist. For a primary index, we could still use a binary search on the main file, even if the index did not exist. Example 3 illustrates the improvement in number of blocks accessed.\\nExample 3. Consider the file of Example 1 with r = 300,000 fixed-length records \\nof size R = 100 bytes stored on a disk with block size B = 4,096 bytes. The file has \\nb = 7,500 blocks, as calculated in Example 1. Suppose we want to search for a record \\nwith a specific value for the secondary key—a nonordering key field of the file that is \\nV = 9 bytes long. Without the secondary index, to do a linear search on the file would \\nrequire b/2 = 7,500/2 = 3,750 block accesses on the average. Suppose that we con-\\nstruct a secondary index on that nonordering key  field of the file. As in Example 1, a \\nblock pointer is P = 6 bytes long, so each index entry is R\\ni = (9 + 6) = 15 bytes, and the \\nblocking factor for the index is bfri = ⎣(B/Ri)⎦ = ⎣(4,096/15) ⎦ = 273 index entries per \\nblock. In a dense secondary index such as this, the total number of index entries ri is \\nequal to the number of records  in the data file, which is 300,000. The number of blocks \\nneeded for the index is hence bi = ⎡(ri/bfri)⎤ = ⎡(300,000/273) ⎤ = 1,099 blocks.'),\n",

To search for a record using th e index, we need an additional block access \\nto the data file for a total of 11 + 1 = 12 block accesses—a vast improvement over the 3,750 block accesses needed on the average fo r a linear search, but slightly worse \\nthan the 6 block accesses required for the primary index. This difference arose because the primary index was nondense and hence shorter, with only 28 blocks in length as opposed to the 1,099 blocks dense index here.\\nWe can also create a secondary index on a nonkey, nonordering field  of a file. In this \\ncase, numerous records in the data file can have the same value for the indexing field. There are several options for implementing such an index:\\n ■Option 1 is to include duplicate index entries with the same K(i) value—one \\nfor each record. This would be a dense index.\\n ■Option 2 is to have variable-length records for the index entries, with a \\nrepeating field for the pointer. We keep a list of pointers < P(i, 1), … , P(i, k)> \\nin the index entry for K(i)—one pointer to each block that contains a record \\nwhose indexing field value equals K(i). In either option 1 or option 2, the \\nbinary search algorithm on the index must be modified appropriately to account for a variable number of index entries per index key value.\\n ■Option 3, which is more commonly used, is to keep the index entries them-\\nselves at a fixed length and have a single entry for each index field value , but \\nto create an extra level of indirection  to handle the multiple pointers. In this \\nnondense scheme, the pointer P(i) in index entry < K(i), P(i)> points to a \\ndisk block, which contains a set of record pointers ; each record pointer in \\nthat disk block points to one of the data file records with value K(i) for the \\nindexing field. If some value K(i) occurs in too many records, so that their \\nrecord pointers cannot fit in a single disk block, a cluster or linked list of blocks is used. This technique is illustrated in Figure 17.5. Retrieval via the index requires one or more additional block accesses because of the extra level, but the algorithms for searching the index and (more importantly) for inserting of new records in the data file are straightforward. The binary search algorithm is directly applicable to the index file since it is ordered. For range retrievals such as retrieving records where V\\n1 ≤ K ≤ V2, block \\npointers may be used in the pool of pointers for each value instead of the record pointers. Then a union operation can be used on the pools of block pointers corresponding to the entries from V\\n1 to V2 in the index to eliminate \\nduplicates and the resulting blocks can be accessed. In addition, retrievals on complex selection conditions may be handled by referring to the record pointers from multiple non-key secondary indexes, without having to retrieve many unnecessary records from the data file (see Exercise 17.24).\\nNotice that a secondary index provides a logical ordering  on the records by the \\nindexing field. If we access the records in order of the entries in the secondary index, we get them in order of the indexing field. The primary and clustering indexes assume that the field used for physical ordering  of records in the file is the \\nsame as the indexing field.'),\n",

A \\nbinary search is applied to the index to locate pointers to a disk block or to a record (or records) in the file having a specific index field value. A binary search requires approximately (log\\n2 bi) block accesses for an index with bi blocks because each step \\nof the algorithm reduces the part of the index file that we continue to search by a factor of 2. This is why we take the log function to the base 2. The idea behind a multilevel index  is to reduce the part of the index that we continue to search by \\nbfr\\ni, the blocking factor for the index, which is larger than 2. Hence, the search \\nspace is reduced much faster. The value bfri is called the fan-out  of the multilevel \\nindex, and we will refer to it by the symbol fo. Whereas we divide the record search \\nspace  into two halves at each step during a binary search, we divide it n-ways \\n(where n = the fan-out) at each search step using the multilevel index. Searching a \\nmultilevel index requires approximately (log fo bi) block accesses, which is a sub-\\nstantially smaller number than for a binary search if the fan-out is larger than 2. In most cases, the fan-out is much larger than 2. Given a blocksize of 4,096, which is most common in today’s DBMSs, the fan-out depends on how many (key + block pointer) entries fit within a block. With a 4-byte block pointer (which would accommodate 2\\n32 − 1 = 4.2 *109 blocks) and a 9-byte key such as SSN, the fan-out \\ncomes to 315.\\nA multilevel index considers the index file, which we will now refer to as the first  \\n(or base ) level  of a multilevel index, as an ordered file  with a distinct value  for each Table 17.1 T ypes of Indexes Based on the Properties of the Indexing Field\\nIndex Field Used for Physical \\nOrdering of the FileIndex Field Not Used for Physical \\nOrdering of the File\\nIndexing field is key Primary index Secondary index (Key)\\nIndexing field is nonkey Clustering index Secondary index (NonKey)\\nTable 17.2 Properties of Index T ypes\\n \\nType of IndexNumber of (First-Level)  \\nIndex EntriesDense or Nondense \\n(Sparse)Block Anchoring \\non the Data File\\nPrimary Number of blocks in data file Nondense Y es\\nClustering Number of distinct index field \\nvaluesNondense Y es/noa\\nSecondary (key) Number of records in data file Dense No\\nSecondary (nonkey) Number of recordsb or number \\nof distinct index field valuescDense or Nondense No\\naY es if every distinct value of the ordering ﬁeld starts a new block; no otherwise.\\nbFor option 1.\\ncFor options 2 and 3.'),\n",

Therefore, by considering the first-level index file as a sorted data file, we can \\ncreate a primary index for the first level; this index to the first level is called the  \\nsecond level  of the multilevel index. Because the second level is a primary index, we \\ncan use block anchors so that the second level has one entry for each block  of the \\nfirst level. The blocking factor bfri for the second level—and for all subsequent \\nlevels—is the same as that for the first-level index because all index entries are the same size; each has one field value and one block address. If the first level has r\\n1 \\nentries, and the blocking factor—which is also the fan-out—for the index is  bfr\\ni = fo, then the first level needs ⎡(r1/fo)⎤ blocks, which is therefore the number of \\nentries r2 needed at the second level of the index.\\nWe can repeat this process for the second level. The third level , which is a primary \\nindex for the second level, has an entry for each second-level block, so the number of third-level entries is r\\n3 = ⎡(r2/fo)⎤. Notice that we require a second level only if the \\nfirst level needs more than one block of disk storage, and, similarly, we require a third level only if the second level needs more than one block. We can repeat the preceding process until all the entries of some index level t fit in a single block. This \\nblock at the tth level is called the top index level.\\n6 Each level reduces the number of \\nentries at the previous level by a factor of fo—the index fan-out—so we can use the \\nformula 1 ≤ ( r1/((fo)t)) to calculate t. Hence, a multilevel index with r1 first-level \\nentries will have approximately t levels, where t = ⎡(log fo(r1))⎤. When searching the \\nindex, a single disk block is retrieved at each level. Hence, t disk blocks are accessed \\nfor an index search, where t is the number of index levels .\\nThe multilevel scheme described here can be used on any type of index—whether it \\nis primary, clustering, or secondary—as long as the first-level index has distinct val-\\nues for K(i) and fixed-length entries.  Figure 17.6 shows a multilevel index built over \\na primary index. Example 3 illustrates the improvement in number of blocks \\naccessed when a multilevel index is used to search for a record.\\nExample 4. Suppose that the dense secondary index of Example 3 is converted \\ninto a multilevel index. We calculated the index blocking factor bfri = 273 index \\nentries per block, which is also the fan-out fo for the multilevel index; the number of \\nfirst-level blocks b1 = 1,099 blocks was also calculated. The number of second-level \\nblocks will be b2 = ⎡(b1/fo)⎤ = ⎡(1,099/273) ⎤ = 5 blocks, and the number of third-\\nlevel blocks will be b3 = ⎡(b2/fo)⎤ = ⎡(5/273) ⎤ = 1 block. Hence, the third level is the \\ntop level of the index, and t = 3. To access a record by searching the multilevel index, \\nwe must access one block at each level plus one block from the data file, so we need t + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4 block accesses. Compare this to Example 3, where 12 block accesses \\nwere needed when a single-level index and binary search were used.\\nNotice that we could also have a multilevel primary index, which would be non-\\ndense. Exercise 17.18(c) illustrates this case, where we must  access the data block \\nfrom the file before we can determine whether the record being searched for is in the file. For a dense index, this can be determined by accessing the first index level \\n6The numbering scheme for index levels used here is the reverse of the way levels are commonly defined \\nfor tree data structures. In tree data structures, t is referred to as level 0 (zero), t − 1 is level 1, and so on.'),\n",

Such an organization is called an indexed sequential file  and was used in a large number of early IBM systems. IBM’s \\nISAM  organization incorporates a two-level index that is closely related to the organi-\\nzation of the disk in terms of cylinders and tracks (see Section 16.2.1). The first level is \\na cylinder index, which has the key value of an anchor record for each cylinder of a disk pack occupied by the file and a pointer to the track index for the cylinder. The track index has the key value of an anchor record for each track in the cylinder and a pointer to the track. The track can then be searched sequentially for the desired record or block. Insertion is handled by some form of overflow file that is merged periodi-cally with the data file. The index is re-created during file reorganization.\\nAlgorithm 17.1 outlines the search procedure for a record in a data file that uses a \\nnondense multilevel primary index with t levels.

We briefly introduce the terminology used in discussing tree data \\nstructures. A tree is formed of nodes . Each node in the tree, except for a special \\nnode called the root , has one parent  node and zero or more child  nodes. The root \\nnode has no parent. A node that does not have any child nodes is called a leaf node; \\na nonleaf node is called an internal  node. The level  of a node is always one more \\nthan the level of its parent, with the level of the root node being zero.7 A subtree  of \\na node consists of that node and all its descendant  nodes—its child nodes, the child \\nnodes of its child nodes, and so on. A precise recursive definition of a subtree is that it consists of a node n and the subtrees of all the child nodes of n. Figure 17.7 illus-\\ntrates a tree data structure.

In the DBMSs prevalent in the market today, the common \\nstructure used for indexing is B+-trees.\\n17.3.1 Search Trees and B-Trees\\nA search tree  is a special type of tree that is used to guide the search for a record, \\ngiven the value of one of the record’s fields. The multilevel indexes discussed in Sec-tion 17.2 can be thought of as a variation of a search tree; each node in the multi-level index can have as many as fo pointers and fo key values, where fo is the index \\nfan-out. The index field values in each node guide us to the next node, until we reach the data file block that contains the required records. By following a pointer, we restrict our search at each level to a subtree of the search tree and ignore all nodes not in this subtree.\\nSearch Trees. A search tree is slightly different from a multilevel index. A \\nsearch tree of order  p is a tree such that each node contains at most p  − 1 search \\nvalues and p pointers in the order < P\\n1, K1, P2, K2, … , Pq−1, Kq−1, Pq>, where q ≤ p. \\nEach Pi is a pointer to a child node (or a NULL  pointer), and each Ki is a search \\nvalue from some ordered set of values. All search values are assumed to be \\nunique.8 Figure 17.8 illustrates a node in a search tree. Two constraints must hold \\nat all times on the search tree:\\n  1. Within each node, K1 < K2 < … < Kq−1.\\n  2. For all values X in the subtree pointed at by Pi, we have Ki−1 < X < Ki for \\n1 < i < q; X < Ki for i = 1; and Ki−1 < X for i = q (see Figure 17.8).\\nWhenever we search for a value X, we follow the appropriate pointer Pi according \\nto the formulas in condition 2 above. Figure 17.9 illustrates a search tree of order  p = 3 and integer search values. Notice that some of the pointers P\\ni in a node may be \\nNULL  pointers.\\nWe can use a search tree as a mechanism to search for records stored in a disk file. \\nThe values in the tree can be the values of one of the fields of the file, called the \\n8This restriction can be relaxed.

Each key value in the tree is associated with a pointer to the record in the \\ndata file having that value. Alternatively, the pointer could be to the disk block con-\\ntaining that record. The search tree itself can be stored on disk by assigning each \\ntree node to a disk block. When a new record is inserted in the file, we must update \\nthe search tree by inserting an entry in the tree containing the search field value of \\nthe new record and a pointer to the new record.\\nAlgorithms are necessary for inserting and deleting search values into and from the \\nsearch tree while maintaining the preceding two constraints. In general, these algo-\\nrithms do not guarantee that a search tree is balanced , meaning that all of its leaf \\nnodes are at the same level.9 The tree in Figure 17.7 is not balanced because it has \\nleaf nodes at levels 1, 2, and 3. The goals for balancing a search tree are as follows:\\n ■To guarantee that nodes are evenly distributed, so that the depth of the tree \\nis minimized for the given set of keys and that the tree does not get skewed with some nodes being at very deep levels\\n ■To make the search speed uniform, so that the average time to find any ran-\\ndom key is roughly the same\\nMinimizing the number of levels in the tree is one goal, another implicit goal is to \\nmake sure that the index tree does not need too much restructuring as records are inserted into and deleted from the main file. Thus we want the nodes to be as full as possible and do not want any nodes to be empty if there are too many deletions. Record deletion may leave some nodes in the tree nearly empty, thus wasting stor-age space and increasing the number of levels. The B-tree addresses both of these problems by specifying additional constraints on the search tree.\\nB-Trees. The B-tree has additional constraints that ensure that the tree is always \\nbalanced and that the space wasted by deletion, if any, never becomes excessive. The algorithms for insertion and deletion, though, become more complex in order to maintain these constraints. Nonetheless, most insertions and deletions are sim-ple processes; they become complicated only under special circumstances—namely, whenever we attempt an insertion into a node that is already full or a deletion from 5\\n3Tree node pointer\\nNull tree pointer\\n69\\n78 1 2 1Figure 17.9 \\nA search tree of order p = 3.\\n9The definition of balanced  is different for binary trees.

More formally, a B-tree of order  p, when \\nused as an access structure on a key field  to search for records in a data file, can be \\ndefined as follows:\\n  1. Each internal node in the B-tree (Figure 17.10(a)) is of the form\\n<P1, <K1, Pr1>, P2, <K2, Pr2>, … , < Kq–1, Prq–1>, Pq>\\nwhere q ≤ p. Each Pi is a tree pointer —a pointer to another node in the \\nB-tree. Each Pri is a data pointer10—a pointer to the record whose search \\nkey field value is equal to Ki (or to the data file block containing that record).\\n  2. Within each node, K1 < K2 < … < Kq−1.\\n  3. For all search key field values X in the subtree pointed at by Pi (the ith sub-\\ntree, see Figure 17.10(a)), we have:\\nKi−1 < X < Ki for 1 < i < q; X < Ki for i = 1; and Ki−1 < X for i = q\\n  4. Each node has at most p tree pointers.\\n  5. Each node, except the root and leaf nodes, has at least ⎡(p/2)⎤ tree pointers. \\nThe root node has at least two tree pointers unless it is the only node in \\nthe tree.\\n  6. A node with q tree pointers, q ≤ p, has q − 1 search key field values (and \\nhence has q − 1 data pointers).\\n  7. All leaf nodes are at the same level. Leaf nodes have the same structure as \\ninternal nodes except that all of their tree pointers P i are NULL .\\nFigure 17.10(b) illustrates a B-tree of order p = 3. Notice that all search values K in \\nthe B-tree are unique because we assumed that the tree is used as an access structure on a key field. If we use a B-tree on a nonkey field , we must change the definition of \\nthe file pointers Pr\\ni to point to a block—or a cluster of blocks—that contain the \\npointers to the file records. This extra level of indirection is similar to option 3, dis-\\ncussed in Section 17.1.3, for secondary indexes.\\nA B-tree starts with a single root node (which is also a leaf node) at level 0 (zero). \\nOnce the root node is full with p − 1 search key values and we attempt to insert \\nanother entry in the tree, the root node splits into two nodes at level 1. Only the middle value is kept in the root node, and the rest of the values are split evenly between the other two nodes. When a nonroot node is full and a new entry is inserted into it, that node is split into two nodes at the same level, and the middle entry is moved to the parent node along with two pointers to the new split nodes. If the parent node is full, it is also split. Splitting can propagate all the way to the root node, creating a new level if the root is split. We do not discuss algorithms for B-trees in detail in this text,\\n11 but we outline search and insertion procedures for \\nB+-trees in the next section.\\n10A data pointer is either a block address or a record address; the latter is essentially a block address \\nand a record offset within the block.\\n11For details on insertion and deletion algorithms for B-trees, consult Ramakrishnan and Gehrke (2003).'),\n",

It has been shown by analysis and simulation that, after numerous random insertions and deletions on a B-tree, the nodes are approximately 69% full when the number of values in the tree stabilizes. This is also true of B\\n+-trees. If this happens, node splitting and combining will \\noccur only rarely, so insertion and deletion become quite efficient.

Hence, for the given block size (512 bytes), record/data pointer size (7 bytes), tree/block pointer size (6 bytes), and search key field size (9bytes), a two-level B-tree of order 23 with 69% occupancy holds 3,840 + 240 + 15 = 4,095 entries on the aver-age; a three-level B-tree holds 65,535 entries on the average.\\nB-trees are sometimes used as primary file organizations . In this case, whole \\nrecords  are stored within the B-tree nodes rather than just the <search key, record \\npointer> entries. This works well for files with a relatively small number of records  \\nand a small record size.  Otherwise, the fan-out and the number of levels become too \\ngreat to permit efficient access.\\nIn summary, B-trees provide a multilevel access structure that is a balanced tree \\nstructure in which each node is at least half full. Each node in a B-tree of order p can \\nhave at most p − 1 search values.\\n17.3.2 B+-Trees\\nMost implementations of a dynamic multilevel index use a variation of the B-tree data \\nstructure called a B+-tree . In a B-tree, every value of the search field appears once at \\nsome level in the tree, along with a data pointer. In a B+-tree, data pointers are stored \\nonly at the leaf nodes  of the tree; hence, the structure of leaf nodes differs from the \\nstructure of internal nodes. The leaf nodes have an entry for every  value of the search \\nfield, along with a data pointer to the record (or to the block that contains this record) if the search field is a key field. For a nonkey search field, the pointer points to a block containing pointers to the data file records, creating an extra level of indirection.\\nThe leaf nodes of the B\\n+-tree are usually linked to provide ordered access on the \\nsearch field to the records. These leaf nodes are similar to the first (base) level of an index. Internal nodes of the B\\n+-tree correspond to the other levels of a multilevel \\nindex. Some search field values from the leaf nodes are repeated  in the internal \\nnodes of the B+-tree to guide the search. The structure of the internal nodes  of a  \\nB+-tree of order p (Figure 17.11(a)) is as follows:\\n  1.

By starting at the \\nleftmost leaf node, it is possible to traverse leaf nodes as a linked list, using the Pnext \\npointers. This provides ordered access to the data records on the indexing field. A P\\nprevious  pointer can also be included. For a B+-tree on a nonkey field, an extra level \\nof indirection is needed similar to the one shown in Figure 17.5, so the Pr pointers \\nare block pointers to blocks that contain a set of record pointers to the actual records in the data file, as discussed in option 3 of Section 17.1.3.\\nBecause entries in the internal nodes  of a B\\n+-tree include search values and tree \\npointers without any data pointers, more entries can be packed into an internal node of a B\\n+-tree than for a similar B-tree. Thus, for the same block (node) size, the \\norder p will be larger for the B+-tree than for the B-tree, as we illustrate in Example 6. \\nThis can lead to fewer B+-tree levels, improving search time. Because the structures \\nfor internal and for leaf nodes of a B+-tree are different, the order p can be different. \\nWe will use p to denote the order for internal nodes  and pleaf to denote the order \\nfor leaf nodes , which we define as being the maximum number of data pointers in \\na leaf node.\\nExample 6. To calculate the order p of a B+-tree, suppose that the search key field \\nis V = 9 bytes long, the block size is B = 512 bytes, a record pointer is Pr = 7 bytes, \\nand a block pointer/tree pointer is P = 6 bytes. An internal node of the B+-tree can \\nhave up to p tree pointers and p − 1 search field values; these must fit into a single \\nblock. Hence, we have:\\n(p * P) + (( p − 1) * V) ≤ B\\n(p * 6) + (( p − 1) * 9) ≤ 512\\n(15 * p) ≤ 512\\nWe can choose p to be the largest value satisfying the above inequality, which gives \\np = 34. This is larger than the value of 23 for the B-tree (it is left to the reader to \\ncompute the order of the B-tree assuming same size pointers), resulting in a larger fan-out and more entries in each internal node of a B\\n+-tree than in the correspond-\\ning B-tree. The leaf nodes of the B+-tree will have the same number of values and \\npointers, except that the pointers are data pointers and a next pointer.

Compare this to the 65,535 entries for the corresponding B-tree in Example 5.

Deletion may cause underflow  by reducing the number of \\nentries in the leaf node to below the minimum required. In this case, we try to find a sibling leaf node—a leaf node directly to the left or to the right of the node with underflow—and redistribute the entries among the node and its sibling  so that \\nboth are at least half full; otherwise, the node is merged with its siblings and the number of leaf nodes is reduced. A common method is to try to redistribute  \\nentries with the left sibling; if this is not possible, an attempt to redistribute with the right sibling is made. If this is also not possible, the three nodes are merged into two leaf nodes. In such a case, underflow may propagate to internal  nodes \\nbecause one fewer tree pointer and search value are needed. This can propagate and reduce the tree levels.\\nNotice that implementing the insertion and deletion algorithms may require par-\\nent and sibling pointers for each node, or the use of a stack as in Algorithm 17.3.

In many retrieval and update requests, multiple attributes are involved. If a certain combination of attri-butes is used frequently, it is advantageous to set up an access structure to provide efficient access by a key value that is a combination of those attributes.\\nFor example, consider an \\nEMPLOYEE  file containing attributes Dno (department \\nnumber), Age, Street , City, Zip_code , Salary  and Skill_code , with the key of Ssn (Social \\nSecurity number). Consider the query: List the employees in department number 4 \\nwhose age is 59 . Note that both Dno and Age are nonkey attributes, which means \\nthat a search value for either of these will point to multiple records. The following alternative search strategies may be considered:\\n  1. Assuming Dno has an index, but Age does not, access the records having \\nDno = 4 using the index, and then select from among them those records \\nthat satisfy Age = 59.\\n  2. Alternately, if Age is indexed but Dno is not, access the records having  \\nAge = 59 using the index, and then select from among them those records that \\nsatisfy Dno = 4.\\n  3. If indexes have been created on both Dno and Age, both indexes may be \\nused; each gives a set of records or a set of pointers (to blocks or records). An intersection of these sets of records or pointers yields those records or point-ers that satisfy both conditions.\\nAll of these alternatives eventually give the correct result. However, if the set of \\nrecords that meet each condition (\\nDno = 4 or Age = 59) individually are large, yet \\nonly a few records satisfy the combined condition, then none of the above is an effi-cient technique for the given search request. Note also that queries such as “find the minimum or maximum age among all employees” can be answered just by using the index on Age, without going to the data file. Finding the maximum or minimum age within Dno = 4, however, would not be answerable just by processing the index alone. Also, listing the departments in which employees with Age = 59 work will also not be possible by processing just the indexes. A number of possibilities exist that would treat the combination <\\nDno, Age> or < Age, Dno> as a search key made up of \\nmultiple attributes. We briefly outline these techniques in the following sections. We will refer to keys containing multiple attributes as composite keys .\\n17.4.1 Ordered Index on Multiple Attributes\\nAll the discussion in this chapter so far still applies if we create an index on a search \\nkey field that is a combination of < Dno, Age>. The search key is a pair of values  \\n<4, 59> in the above example. In general, if an index is created on attributes  \\n<A1, A2, … , An>, the search key values are tuples with n values: < v1, v2, … , vn>.\\nA lexicographic ordering of these tuple values establishes an order on this compos-\\nite search key. For our example, all of the department keys for department number'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 662}, page_content='632 Chapter 17 Indexing Structures for Files and Physical Database Design\\n3 precede those for department number 4. Thus <3, n> precedes <4, m> for any \\nvalues of m and n. The ascending key order for keys with Dno = 4 would be <4, 18>, \\n<4, 19>, <4, 20>, and so on. Lexicographic ordering works similarly to ordering of character strings. An index on a composite key of n attributes works similarly to \\nany index discussed in this chapter so far.\\n17.4.2 Partitioned Hashing\\nPartitioned hashing is an extension of static external hashing (Section 16.8.2) that allows access on multiple keys. It is suitable only for equality comparisons; range queries are not supported. In partitioned hashing, for a key consisting of n compo-\\nnents, the hash function is designed to produce a result with n separate hash \\naddresses. The bucket address is a concatenation of these n addresses. It is then pos-\\nsible to search for the required composite search key by looking up the appropriate buckets that match the parts of the address in which we are interested.\\nFor example, consider the composite search key <\\nDno, Age>. If Dno and Age are \\nhashed into a 3-bit and 5-bit address respectively, we get an 8-bit bucket address. \\nSuppose that Dno = 4 has a hash address ‘100’ and Age = 59 has hash address ‘10101’. \\nThen to search for the combined search value, Dno = 4 and Age = 59, one goes to \\nbucket address 100 10101; just to search for all employees with Age = 59, all buckets \\n(eight of them) will be searched whose addresses are ‘000 10101’, ‘001 10101’, … \\nand so on. An advantage of partitioned hashing is that it can be easily extended to \\nany number of attributes. The bucket addresses can be designed so that high-order \\nbits in the addresses correspond to more frequently accessed attributes. Addition-ally, no separate access structure needs to be maintained for the individual attri-butes. The main drawback of partitioned hashing is that it cannot handle range \\nqueries on any of the component attributes. Additionally, most hash functions do \\nnot maintain records in order by the key being hashed. Hence, accessing records in \\nlexicographic order by a combination of attributes such as <\\nDno, Age> used as a key \\nwould not be straightforward or efficient.\\n17.4.3 Grid Files\\nAnother alternative is to organize the EMPLOYEE  file as a grid file. If we want to \\naccess a file on two keys, say Dno and Age as in our example, we can construct a grid \\narray with one linear scale (or dimension) for each of the search attributes. Fig-\\nure 17.14 shows a grid array for the EMPLOYEE  file with one linear scale for Dno and \\nanother for the Age attribute. The scales are made in a way as to achieve a uniform \\ndistribution of that attribute. Thus, in our example, we show that the linear scale for \\nDno has Dno = 1, 2 combined as one value 0 on the scale, whereas Dno = 5 corre-\\nsponds to the value 2 on that scale. Similarly, Age is divided into its scale of 0 to 5 by \\ngrouping ages so as to distribute the employees uniformly by age. The grid array \\nshown for this file has a total of 36 cells. Each cell points to some bucket address \\nwhere the records corresponding to that cell are stored. Figure 17.14 also shows the \\nassignment of cells to buckets (only partially).'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 663}, page_content='17.5 Other Types of Indexes  633\\nThus our request for Dno = 4 and Age = 59 maps into the cell (1, 5) corresponding \\nto the grid array. The records for this combination will be found in the correspond-ing bucket. This method is particularly useful for range queries that would map into a set of cells corresponding to a group of values along the linear scales. If a range query corresponds to a match on the some of the grid cells, it can be processed by accessing exactly the buckets for those grid cells. For example, a query for \\nDno ≤ 5 \\nand Age > 40 refers to the data in the top bucket shown in Figure 17.14.\\nThe grid file concept can be applied to any number of search keys. For example, for \\nn search keys, the grid array would have n dimensions. The grid array thus allows a \\npartitioning of the file along the dimensions of the search key attributes and provides an access by combinations of values along those dimensions. Grid files perform well in terms of reduction in time for multiple key access. However, they represent a space overhead in terms of the grid array structure. Moreover, with dynamic files, a frequent reorganization of the file adds to the maintenance cost.\\n14\\n17.5 Other Types of Indexes\\n17.5.1 Hash Indexes\\nIt is also possible to create access structures similar to indexes that are based on hashing . The hash index  is a secondary structure to access the file by using hashing \\non a search key other than the one used for the primary data file organization. The \\nindex entries are of the type < K, Pr> or < K, P>, where Pr is a pointer to the record \\ncontaining the key, or P is a pointer to the block containing the record for that key. \\nThe index file with these index entries can be organized as a dynamically expand-\\nable hash file, using one of the techniques described in Section 16.8.3; searching for \\nan entry uses the hash search algorithm on K.

Figure 17.15 illus-\\ntrates a hash index on the Emp_id  field for a file that has been stored as a sequential \\nfile ordered by Name . The Emp_id  is hashed to a bucket number by using a hashing \\nfunction: the sum of the digits of Emp_id  modulo 10. For example, to find Emp_id  \\n51024, the hash function results in bucket number 2; that bucket is accessed first. It contains the index entry < 51024, Pr >; the pointer Pr leads us to the actual record \\nin the file. In a practical application, there may be thousands of buckets; the bucket number, which may be several bits long, would be subjected to the directory schemes discussed in the context of dynamic hashing in Section 16.8.3. Other search structures can also be used as indexes.\\n17.5.2 Bitmap Indexes\\nThe bitmap index  is another popular data structure that facilitates querying on \\nmultiple keys. Bitmap indexing is used for relations that contain a large number of rows. It creates an index for one or more columns, and each value or value range in Bucket 0Emp_id\\n. . . . . . . . . .\\n12676 Marcus M . .\\n. . . . . . . . . .\\n13646 Hanson M . .\\n. . . . . . . . . .21124 Dunhill M . .. . . . . . . . . .23402 Clarke F . .. . . . . . . . . .\\n34723 Ferragamo F . .\\n. . . . . . . . . .41301 Zara F . .. . . . . . . . . . 51024 Bass M . .. . . . . . . . . .\\n62104 England M . .\\n. . . . . . . . . .71221 Abercombe F . .. . . . . . . . . .81165 Gucci F . .. . . . . . . . . .13646\\n21124. . . . .Lastname Sex    . . . . .\\nBucket 1\\n2340281165. . . . .\\nBucket 2\\n5102412676. . . . .\\nBucket 3\\n6210471221. . . . .\\nBucket 9\\n3472341301. . . . .Figure 17.15 \\nHash-based indexing.'),\n",

Typically, a bitmap index is created for those columns \\nthat contain a fairly small number of unique values. To build a bitmap index on a \\nset of records in a relation, the records must be numbered from 0 to n with an id (a \\nrecord id or a row id) that can be mapped to a physical address made of a block number and a record offset within the block.\\nA bitmap index is built on one particular value  of a particular field (the column in \\na relation) and is just an array of bits. Thus, for a given field, there is one separate bitmap index (or a vector) maintained corresponding to each unique value in the database. Consider a bitmap index for the column C and a value V for that column. \\nFor a relation with n rows, it contains n bits. The ith bit is set to 1 if the row i has the \\nvalue V for column C; otherwise it is set to a 0. If C contains the valueset < v\\n1, v2, … , \\nvm> with m distinct values, then m bitmap indexes would be created for that col-\\numn. Figure 17.16 shows the relation EMPLOYEE  with columns Emp_id , Lname , Sex, \\nZipcode , and Salary_grade  (with just eight rows for illustration) and a bitmap index \\nfor the Sex and Zipcode  columns. As an example, if the bitmap for Sex = F, the bits \\nfor Row_ids  1, 3, 4, and 7 are set to 1, and the rest of the bits are set to 0, the bitmap \\nindexes could have the following query applications:\\n ■For the query C1 = V1, the corresponding bitmap for value V1 returns the \\nRow_id s containing the rows that qualify.\\n ■For the query C1= V1 and C2 = V2 (a multikey search request), the two cor-\\nresponding bitmaps are retrieved and intersected (logically AND-ed) to \\nyield the set of Row_id s that qualify. In general, k bitvectors can be inter-\\nsected to deal with k equality conditions. Complex AND-OR conditions can \\nalso be supported using bitmap indexing.\\n /box4For the query C1 = V1 or C2 = V2 or C3 = V3 (a multikey search request), \\nthe three corresponding bitmaps for three different attributes are retrieved \\nand unioned (logically OR-ed) to yield the set of Row id s that qualify.EMPLOYEE\\nRow_id Emp_id Lname Sex Zipcode Salary_grade\\n0 51024 Bass M 94040 ..\\n1 23402 Clarke F 30022 ..\\n2 62104 England M 19046 ..\\n3 34723 Ferragamo F 30022 ..\\n4 81165 Gucci F 19046 ..\\n5 13646 Hanson M 19046 ..\\n6 12676 Marcus M 30022 ..\\n7 41301 Zara F 94040 ..\\nBitmap index for Sex\\n        M          F\\n10100110 01011001\\nBitmap index for Zipcode\\nZipcode 1 9046 Zipcode 30022 Zipcode 94040\\n    00101100     01010010     10000001Figure 17.16 \\nBitmap indexes for Sex and Zipcode.'),\n",

To find employees with Sex = F and Zipcode  = 30022, we \\nintersect the bitmaps “01011001” and “01010010” yielding Row_id s 1 and 3. \\nEmployees who do not live in Zipcode = 94040 are obtained by complementing the bitvector “10000001” and yields Row_ids 1 through 6. In general, if we assume uniform distribution of values for a given column, and if one column has 5 distinct values and another has 10 distinct values, the join condition on these two can be considered to have a selectivity of 1/50 (= 1/5 * 1/10). Hence, only about 2% of the records would actually have to be retrieved. If a column has only a few values, like the \\nSex column in Figure 17.16, retrieval of the Sex = M condition on average \\nwould retrieve 50% of the rows; in such cases, it is better to do a complete scan rather than use bitmap indexing.\\nIn general, bitmap indexes are efficient in terms of the storage space that they need. \\nIf we consider a file of 1 million rows (records) with record size of 100 bytes per \\nrow, each bitmap index would take up only one bit per row and hence would use 1 \\nmillion bits or 125 Kbytes. Suppose this relation is for 1 million residents of a state, \\nand they are spread over 200 ZIP Codes; the 200 bitmaps over \\nZipcodes  contribute \\n200 bits (or 25 bytes) worth of space per row; hence, the 200 bitmaps occupy only \\n25% as much space as the data file. They allow an exact retrieval of all residents who \\nlive in a given ZIP Code by yielding their Row_id s.\\nWhen records are deleted, renumbering rows and shifting bits in bitmaps becomes \\nexpensive. Another bitmap, called the existence bitmap , can be used to avoid this \\nexpense. This bitmap has a 0 bit for the rows that have been deleted but are still physically present and a 1 bit for rows that actually exist. Whenever a row is inserted in the relation, an entry must be made in all the bitmaps of all the columns that have a bitmap index; rows typically are appended to the relation or may replace deleted rows to minimize the impact on the reorganization of the bitmaps. This process still constitutes an indexing overhead.\\nLarge bitvectors are handled by treating them as a series of 32-bit or 64-bit vectors, \\nand corresponding AND, OR, and NOT operators are used from the instruction set to deal with 32- or 64-bit input vectors in a single instruction. This makes bitvector operations computationally very efficient.\\nBitmaps for B\\n+-Tree Leaf Nodes. Bitmaps can be used on the leaf nodes of  \\nB+-tree indexes as well as to point to the set of records that contain each specific value \\nof the indexed field in the leaf node. When the B+-tree is built on a nonkey search \\nfield, the leaf record must contain a list of record pointers alongside each value of \\nthe indexed attribute. For values that occur very frequently, that is, in a large per-\\ncentage of the relation, a bitmap index may be stored instead of the pointers. As an'),\n",

If the record pointer takes up 4 \\nbytes (32 bits), then the n/10 record pointers would take up 4 * n/10 or 0.4 n bytes. \\nSince 0.4 n is more than 3 times larger than 0.125 n, it is better to store the bitmap \\nindex rather than the record pointers. Hence for search values that occur more fre-quently than a certain ratio (in this case that would be 1/32), it is beneficial to use bitmaps as a compressed storage mechanism for representing the record pointers in B\\n+-trees that index a nonkey field.\\n17.5.3 Function-Based Indexing\\nIn this section, we discuss a new type of indexing, called function-based indexing , \\nthat has been introduced in the Oracle relational DBMS as well as in some other commercial products.\\n15\\nThe idea behind function-based indexing is to create an index such that the value that results from applying some function on a field or a collection of fields becomes \\nthe key to the index. The following examples show how to create and use function-\\nbased indexes.\\nExample 1. The following statement creates a function-based index on the \\nEMPLOYEE  table based on an uppercase representation of the Lname  column, which \\ncan be entered in many ways but is always queried by its uppercase representation.\\nCREATE INDEX upper_ix ON Employee (UPPER(Lname));\\nThis statement will create an index based on the function UPPER(Lname) , which returns \\nthe last name in uppercase letters; for example, UPPER(\\'Smith\\')  will return ‘SMITH’ .\\nFunction-based indexes ensure that Oracle Database system will use the index \\nrather than perform a full table scan, even when a function is used in the search predicate of a query. For example, the following query will use the index:\\nSELECT First_name, Lname\\nFROM EmployeeWHERE UPPER(Lname)= \"SMITH\".\\nWithout the function-based index, an Oracle Database might perform a full table \\nscan, since a B+-tree index is searched only by using the column value directly; the \\nuse of any function on a column prevents such an index from being used.\\nExample 2. In this example, the EMPLOYEE  table is supposed to contain two \\nfields— salary  and commission_pct  (commission percentage)—and an index is being \\ncreated on the sum of salary  and commission based on the commission_pct .\\nCREATE INDEX income_ix\\nON Employee(Salary + (Salary*Commission_pct));\\n15Rafi Ahmed contributed most of this section.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 668}, page_content='638 Chapter 17 Indexing Structures for Files and Physical Database Design\\nThe following query uses the income_ix  index even though the fields salary  and \\ncommission_pct  are occurring in the reverse order in the query when compared to \\nthe index definition.\\nSELECT First_name, Lname\\nFROM EmployeeWHERE ((Salary*Commission_pct) + Salary ) > 15000;\\nExample 3. This is a more advanced example of using function-based indexing \\nto define conditional uniqueness. The following statement creates a unique func-tion-based index on the \\nORDERS  table that prevents a customer from taking \\nadvantage of a promotion id (“blowout sale”) more than once. It creates a compos-ite index on the \\nCustomer_id  and Promotion_id  fields together, and it allows only one \\nentry in the index for a given Customer_id  with the Promotion_id  of “2” by declaring \\nit as a unique index.\\nCREATE UNIQUE INDEX promo_ix ON Orders\\n(CASE WHEN Promotion_id = 2 THEN Customer_id ELSE NULL END,CASE WHEN Promotion_id = 2 THEN Promotion_id ELSE NULL END);\\nNote that by using the CASE  statement, the objective is to remove from the index any \\nrows where Promotion_id  is not equal to 2. Oracle Database does not store in the  \\nB+-tree index any rows where all the keys are NULL . Therefore, in this example, we \\nmap both Customer_id  and Promotion_id  to NULL  unless Promotion_id  is equal to 2. The \\nresult is that the index constraint is violated only if Promotion_id is equal to 2, for \\ntwo (attempted insertions of) rows with the same Customer_id  value.\\n17.6 Some General Issues Concerning Indexing\\n17.6.1 Logical versus Physical Indexes\\nIn the earlier discussion, we have assumed that the index entries < K, Pr> (or < K, P>) \\nalways include a physical pointer Pr (or P) that specifies the physical record address \\non disk as a block number and offset. This is sometimes called a physical index , and \\nit has the disadvantage that the pointer must be changed if the record is moved to another disk location. For example, suppose that a primary file organization is based on linear hashing or extendible hashing; then, each time a bucket is split, \\nsome records are allocated to new buckets and hence have new physical addresses. If there was a secondary index on the file, the pointers to those records would have to be found and updated, which is a difficult task.\\nTo remedy this situation, we can use a structure called a logical index , whose index \\nentries are of the form < K, K\\np>. Each entry has one value K for the secondary index-\\ning field matched with the value Kp of the field used for the primary file organiza-\\ntion. By searching the secondary index on the value of K, a program can locate the \\ncorresponding value of Kp and use this to access the record through the primary file \\norganization, using a primary index if available. Logical indexes thus introduce an'),\n",

They are \\nused when physical record addresses are expected to change frequently. The cost of this indirection is the extra search based on the primary file organization.\\n17.6.2 Index Creation\\nMany RDBMSs have a similar type of command for creating an index, although it is not part of the SQL standard. The general form of this command is:\\nCREATE  [ UNIQUE  ] INDEX  <index name >\\nON <table name > ( < column name > [ < order > ] { , < column name > [ < order > ] } )\\n[ CLUSTER  ] ;\\nThe keywords UNIQUE  and CLUSTER  are optional. The keyword CLUSTER  is used \\nwhen the index to be created should also sort the data file records on the indexing attribute. Thus, specifying \\nCLUSTER  on a key (unique) attribute would create some \\nvariation of a primary index, whereas specifying CLUSTER  on a nonkey (nonu-\\nnique) attribute would create some variation of a clustering index. The value for <\\norder > can be either ASC (ascending) or DESC (descending), and it specifies \\nwhether the data file should be ordered in ascending or descending values of the \\nindexing attribute. The default is ASC. For example, the following would create a \\nclustering (ascending) index on the nonkey attribute Dno of the EMPLOYEE  file:\\nCREATE  INDEX DnoIndex\\nON EMPLOYEE  (Dno)\\nCLUSTER  ;\\nIndex Creation Process: In many systems, an index is not an integral part of the \\ndata file but can be created and discarded dynamically. That is why it is often called an access structure.  Whenever we expect to access a file frequently based on some \\nsearch condition involving a particular field, we can request the DBMS to create an index on that field as shown above for the DnoIndex. Usually, a secondary index is created to avoid physical ordering of the records in the data file on disk.\\nThe main advantage of secondary indexes is that—theoretically, at least—they can \\nbe created in conjunction with virtually any primary record organization.  Hence, a \\nsecondary index could be used to complement other primary access methods such as ordering or hashing, or it could even be used with mixed files. To create a B\\n+-tree \\nsecondary index on some field of a file, if the file is large and contains millions of \\nrecords, neither the file nor the index would fit in main memory. Insertion of a \\nlarge number of entries into the index is done by a process called bulk loading  the \\nindex. We must go through all records in the file to create the entries at the leaf level of the tree. These entries are then sorted and filled according to the specified fill fac-tor; simultaneously, the other index levels are created. It is more expensive and much harder to create primary indexes and clustering indexes dynamically, because the records of the data file must be physically sorted on disk in order of the indexing field. However, some systems allow users to create these indexes dynamically on their files by sorting the file during index creation.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 670}, page_content='640 Chapter 17 Indexing Structures for Files and Physical Database Design\\nIndexing of Strings: There are a couple of issues that are of particular concern \\nwhen indexing strings. Strings can be variable length (e.g., VARCHAR data type in SQL; see Chapter 6) and strings may be too long limiting the fan-out. If a B\\n+-tree \\nindex is to be built with a string as a search key, there may be an uneven number of keys per index node and the fan-out may vary. Some nodes may be forced to split when they become full regardless of the number of keys in them. The technique of prefix compression  alleviates the situation. Instead of storing the entire string in \\nthe intermediate nodes, it stores only the prefix of the search key adequate to distin-guish the keys that are being separated and directed to the subtree. For example, if Lastname was a search key and we were looking for “Navathe”, the nonleaf node may contain “Nac” for Nachamkin and “Nay” for Nayuddin as the two keys on either side of the subtree pointer that we need to follow.\\n17.6.3 Tuning Indexes\\nThe initial choice of indexes may have to be revised for the following reasons:\\n ■Certain queries may take too long to run for lack of an index.\\n ■Certain indexes may not get utilized at all.\\n ■Certain indexes may undergo too much updating because the index is on an \\nattribute that undergoes frequent changes.\\nMost DBMSs have a command or trace facility, which can be used by the DBA to \\nask the system to show how a query was executed—what operations were per-formed in what order and what secondary access structures (indexes) were used. By analyzing these execution plans (we will discuss this term further in Chapter 18), it is possible to diagnose the causes of the above problems. Some indexes may be dropped and some new indexes may be created based on the tuning analysis.\\nThe goal of tuning is to dynamically evaluate the requirements, which sometimes \\nfluctuate seasonally or during different times of the month or week, and to reorga-\\nnize the indexes and file organizations to yield the best overall performance. Drop-\\nping and building new indexes is an overhead that can be justified in terms of \\nperformance improvements. Updating of a table is generally suspended while an index is dropped or created; this loss of service must be accounted for.\\nBesides dropping or creating indexes and changing from a nonclustered to a clus-\\ntered index and vice versa, rebuilding the index  may improve performance. Most \\nRDBMSs use B\\n+-trees for an index. If there are many deletions on the index key, \\nindex pages may contain wasted space, which can be claimed during a rebuild oper-ation. Similarly, too many insertions may cause overflows in a clustered index that affect performance. Rebuilding a clustered index amounts to reorganizing the entire table ordered on that key.\\nThe available options for indexing and the way they are defined, created, and \\nreorganized vary from system to system. As an illustration, consider the sparse and dense indexes we discussed in Section 17.1. A sparse index such as a primary index will have one index pointer for each page (disk block) in the data file; a'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 671}, page_content='17.6 Some General Issues Concerning Indexing  641\\ndense index such as a unique secondary index will have an index pointer for each \\nrecord. Sybase provides clustering indexes as sparse indexes in the form of  B\\n+-trees, whereas INGRES provides sparse clustering indexes as ISAM files and \\ndense clustering indexes as B+-trees. In some versions of Oracle and DB2, the \\noption of setting up a clustering index is limited to a dense index, and the DBA has to work with this limitation.\\n17.6.4  Additional Issues Related to Storage  \\nof Relations and Indexes\\nUsing an Index for Managing Constraints and Duplicates: It is common to \\nuse an index to enforce a key constraint  on an attribute. While searching the index \\nto insert a new record, it is straightforward to check at the same time whether another record in the file—and hence in the index tree—has the same key attribute value as the new record. If so, the insertion can be rejected.\\nIf an index is created on a nonkey field, duplicates  occur; handling of these dupli-\\ncates is an issue the DBMS product vendors have to deal with and affects data stor-\\nage as well as index creation and management. Data records for the duplicate key \\nmay be contained in the same block or may span multiple blocks where many \\nduplicates are possible. Some systems add a row id to the record so that records \\nwith duplicate keys have their own unique identifiers. In such cases, the B\\n+-tree \\nindex may regard a <key, Row_id> combination as the de facto key for the index, \\nturning the index into a unique index with no duplicates. The deletion of a key K \\nfrom such an index would involve deleting all occurrences of that key K—hence the \\ndeletion algorithm has to account for this.\\nIn actual DBMS products, deletion from B+-tree indexes is also handled in various \\nways to improve performance and response times. Deleted records may be marked \\nas deleted and the corresponding index entries may also not be removed until a \\ngarbage collection process reclaims the space in the data file; the index is rebuilt \\nonline after garbage collection.\\nInverted Files and Other Access Methods: A file that has a secondary index \\non every one of its fields is often called a fully inverted file . Because all indexes are \\nsecondary, new records are inserted at the end of the file; therefore, the data file \\nitself is an unordered (heap) file. The indexes are usually implemented as B+-trees, \\nso they are updated dynamically to reflect insertion or deletion of records. Some \\ncommercial DBMSs, such as Software AG’s Adabas, use this method extensively.\\nWe referred to the popular IBM file organization called ISAM in Section 17.2. \\nAnother IBM method, the virtual storage access method  (VSAM ), is somewhat \\nsimilar to the B+–tree access structure and is still being used in many commercial \\nsystems.\\nUsing Indexing Hints in Queries: DBMSs such as Oracle have a provision for \\nallowing hints in queries that are suggested alternatives or indicators to the query'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 672}, page_content='642 Chapter 17 Indexing Structures for Files and Physical Database Design\\nprocessor and optimizer for expediting query execution. One form of hints is called \\nindexing hints; these hints suggest the use of an index to improve the execution of a query. The hints appear as a special comment (which is preceded by +) and they override all optimizer decisions, but they may be ignored by the optimizer if they are invalid, irrelevant, or improperly formulated. We do not get into a detailed dis-cussion of indexing hints, but illustrate with an example query.\\nFor example, to retrieve the SSN, Salary, and department number for employees \\nworking in department numbers with Dno less than 10:\\nSELECT /*+ INDEX (EMPLOYEE emp_dno_index ) */ Emp_ssn, Salary, Dno\\nFROM EMPLOYEE\\nWHERE Dno < 10;\\nThe above query includes a hint to use a valid index called emp_dno_index (which \\nis an index on the EMPLOYEE relation on Dno).\\nColumn-Based Storage of Relations: There has been a recent trend to con-\\nsider a column-based storage of relations as an alternative to the traditional way of storing relations row by row. Commercial relational DBMSs have offered B\\n+-tree \\nindexing on primary as well as secondary keys as an efficient mechanism to support \\naccess to data by various search criteria and the ability to write a row or a set of rows \\nto disk at a time to produce write-optimized systems. For data warehouses (to be \\ndiscussed in Chapter 29), which are read-only databases, the column-based storage offers particular advantages for read-only queries. Typically, the column-store RDBMSs consider storing each column of data individually and afford performance \\nadvantages in the following areas:\\n ■Vertically partitioning the table column by column, so that a two-column \\ntable can be constructed for every attribute and thus only the needed col-\\numns can be accessed\\n ■Using column-wise indexes (similar to the bitmap indexes discussed in Sec-\\ntion 17.5.2) and join indexes on multiple tables to answer queries without \\nhaving to access the data tables\\n ■Using materialized views (see Chapter 7) to support queries on multiple \\ncolumns\\nColumn-wise storage of data affords additional freedom in the creation of indexes, \\nsuch as the bitmap indexes discussed earlier. The same column may be present in \\nmultiple projections of a table and indexes may be created on each projection. To \\nstore the values in the same column, strategies for data compression, null-value \\nsuppression, dictionary encoding techniques (where distinct values in the column \\nare assigned shorter codes), and run-length encoding techniques have been devised. MonetDB/X100, C-Store, and Vertica are examples of such systems Some popular systems (like Cassandra, Hbase, and Hypertable) have used column-based storage effectively with the concept of wide column-stores . The storage of data in such \\nsystems will be explained in the context of NOSQL systems that we will discuss in Chapter 24.'),\n",

For a given conceptual schema, there are many physical design alterna-tives in a given DBMS. It is not possible to make meaningful physical design decisions and performance analyses until the database designer knows the mix of queries, transactions, and applications that are expected to run on the database. This is called the job mix  for the particular set of database system applications. The \\ndatabase administrators/designers must analyze these applications, their expected \\nfrequencies of invocation, any timing constraints on their execution speed, the \\nexpected frequency of update operations, and any unique constraints on attributes. \\nWe discuss each of these factors next.\\nA. Analyzing the Database Queries and Transactions. Before undertaking \\nthe physical database design, we must have a good idea of the intended use of the database by defining in a high-level form the queries and transactions that are expected to run on the database. For each retrieval query , the following informa-\\ntion about the query would be needed:\\n  1. The files (relations) that will be accessed by the query\\n  2. The attributes on which any selection conditions for the query are specified\\n  3. Whether the selection condition is an equality, inequality, or a range condition\\n  4. The attributes on which any join conditions or conditions to link multiple tables or objects for the query are specified\\n  5. The attributes whose values will be retrieved by the query\\nThe attributes listed in items 2 and 4 above are candidates for the definition of \\naccess structures, such as indexes, hash keys, or sorting of the file.\\nFor each update operation  or update transaction , the following information \\nwould be needed:\\n  1. The files that will be updated\\n  2. The type of operation on each file (insert, update, or delete)\\n  3. The attributes on which selection conditions for a delete or update are specified\\n  4. The attributes whose values will be changed by an update operation\\nAgain, the attributes listed in item 3 are candidates for access structures on the files, \\nbecause they would be used to locate the records that will be updated or deleted. On'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 674}, page_content='644 Chapter 17 Indexing Structures for Files and Physical Database Design\\nthe other hand, the attributes listed in item 4 are candidates for avoiding an access \\nstructure , since modifying them will require updating the access structures.\\nB. Analyzing the Expected Frequency of Invocation of Queries and \\nTransactions. Besides identifying the characteristics of expected retrieval que-\\nries and update transactions, we must consider their expected rates of invocation. \\nThis frequency information, along with the attribute information collected on \\neach query and transaction, is used to compile a cumulative list of the expected \\nfrequency of use for all queries and transactions. This is expressed as the expected frequency of using each attribute in each file as a selection attribute or a join attri-bute, over all the queries and transactions. Generally, for large volumes of pro-cessing, the informal 80–20 rule  can be used: approximately 80% of the processing \\nis accounted for by only 20% of the queries and transactions. Therefore, in practi-cal situations, it is rarely necessary to collect exhaustive statistics and invocation rates on all the queries and transactions; it is sufficient to determine the 20% or so most important ones.\\nC. Analyzing the Time Constraints of Queries and Transactions. Some que-\\nries and transactions may have stringent performance constraints. For example, a transaction may have the constraint that it should terminate within 5 seconds on 95% of the occasions when it is invoked, and that it should never take more than 20 seconds. Such timing constraints place further priorities on the attributes that are candidates for access paths. The selection attributes used by queries and transac-tions with time constraints become higher-priority candidates for primary access structures for the files, because the primary access structures are generally the most efficient for locating records in a file.\\nD. Analyzing the Expected Frequencies of Update Operations. A minimum \\nnumber of access paths should be specified for a file that is frequently updated, \\nbecause updating the access paths themselves slows down the update operations. For \\nexample, if a file that has frequent record insertions has 10 indexes on 10 different attributes, each of these indexes must be updated whenever a new record is inserted. The overhead for updating 10 indexes can slow down the insert operations.\\nE. Analyzing the Uniqueness Constraints on Attributes. Access paths should \\nbe specified on all candidate key  attributes—or sets of attributes—that are either the \\nprimary key of a file or unique attributes. The existence of an index (or other access \\npath) makes it sufficient to search only the index when checking this uniqueness \\nconstraint, since all values of the attribute will exist in the leaf nodes of the index. \\nFor example, when inserting a new record, if a key attribute value of the new record \\nalready exists in the index , the insertion of the new record should be rejected, since \\nit would violate the uniqueness constraint on the attribute.\\nOnce the preceding information is compiled, it is possible to address the physical \\ndatabase design decisions, which consist mainly of deciding on the storage struc-\\ntures and access paths for the database files.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 675}, page_content='17.7 Physical Database Design in Relational Databases  645\\n17.7.2 Physical Database Design Decisions\\nMost relational systems represent each base relation as a physical database file. The \\naccess path options include specifying the type of primary file organization for each relation and the attributes that are candidates for defining individual or composite indexes. At most, one of the indexes on each file may be a primary or a clustering index. Any number of additional secondary indexes can be created.\\nDesign Decisions about Indexing. The attributes whose values are required \\nin equality or range conditions (selection operation) are those that are keys or that participate in join conditions (join operation) requiring access paths, such as indexes.\\nThe performance of queries largely depends upon what indexes or hashing schemes \\nexist to expedite the processing of selections and joins. On the other hand, during insert, delete, or update operations, the existence of indexes adds to the overhead. This overhead must be justified in terms of the gain in efficiency by expediting que-ries and transactions.\\nThe physical design decisions for indexing fall into the following categories:\\n  1. Whether to index an attribute.  The general rules for creating an index on \\nan attribute are that the attribute must either be a key (unique), or there must be some query that uses that attribute either in a selection condition (equality or range of values) or in a join condition. One reason for creating multiple indexes is that some operations can be processed by just scanning the indexes, without having to access the actual data file.\\n  2. What attribute or attributes to index on.  An index can be constructed on a \\nsingle attribute, or on more than one attribute if it is a composite index. If multiple attributes from one relation are involved together in several que-ries, (for example, \\n(Garment_style_#, Color)  in a garment inventory database), \\na multiattribute (composite) index is warranted. The ordering of attributes within a multiattribute index must correspond to the queries. For instance, the above index assumes that queries would be based on an ordering of col-ors within a \\nGarment_style_#  rather than vice versa.\\n  3. Whether to set up a clustered index.  At most, one index per table can be a \\nprimary or clustering index, because this implies that the file be physically ordered on that attribute. In most RDBMSs, this is specified by the keyword \\nCLUSTER . (If the attribute is a key, a primary index  is created, whereas a \\nclustering index  is created if the attribute is not a key .) If a table requires sev-\\neral indexes, the decision about which one should be the primary or cluster-ing index depends upon whether keeping the table ordered on that attribute is needed. Range queries benefit a great deal from clustering. If several attri-butes require range queries, relative benefits must be evaluated before decid-ing which attribute to cluster on. If a query is to be answered by doing an index search only (without retrieving data records), the corresponding index should not be clustered, since the main benefit of clustering is achieved'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 676}, page_content='646 Chapter 17 Indexing Structures for Files and Physical Database Design\\nwhen retrieving the records themselves. A clustering index may be set up as \\na multiattribute index if range retrieval by that composite key is useful in report creation (for example, an index on \\nZip_code , Store_id , and Product_id  \\nmay be a clustering index for sales data).\\n  4. Whether to use a hash index over a tree index.  In general, RDBMSs use  \\nB+-trees for indexing. However, ISAM and hash indexes are also provided in \\nsome systems. B+-trees support both equality and range queries on the attri-\\nbute used as the search key. Hash indexes work well with equality condi-tions, particularly during joins to find a matching record(s), but they do not support range queries.\\n  5. Whether to use dynamic hashing for the file.  For files that are very volatile—\\nthat is, those that grow and shrink continuously—one of the dynamic hashing schemes discussed in Section 16.9 would be suitable. Currently, such schemes are not offered by many commercial RDBMSs.\\n17.8  Summary\\nIn this chapter, we presented file organizations that involve additional access struc-tures, called indexes, to improve the efficiency of retrieval of records from a data file. These access structures may be used in conjunction with  the primary file orga-\\nnizations discussed in Chapter 16, which are used to organize the file records them-\\nselves on disk.\\nThree types of ordered single-level indexes were introduced: primary, clustering, \\nand secondary. Each index is specified on a field of the file. Primary and cluster-\\ning indexes are constructed on the physical ordering field of a file, whereas sec-ondary indexes are specified on nonordering fields as additional access structures to improve performance of queries and transactions. The field for a primary \\nindex must also be a key of the file, whereas it is a nonkey field for a clustering \\nindex. A single-level index is an ordered file and is searched using a binary search. \\nWe showed how multilevel indexes can be constructed to improve the efficiency of searching an index. An example is IBM’s popular indexed sequential access method (ISAM), which is a multilevel index based on the cylinder/track configu-ration on disk.\\nNext we showed how multilevel indexes can be implemented as B-trees and  \\nB\\n+-trees, which are dynamic structures that allow an index to expand and shrink \\ndynamically. The nodes (blocks) of these index structures are kept between half full \\nand completely full by the insertion and deletion algorithms. Nodes eventually sta-\\nbilize at an average occupancy of 69% full, allowing space for insertions without \\nrequiring reorganization of the index for the majority of insertions. B+-trees can \\ngenerally hold more entries in their internal nodes than can B-trees, so they may \\nhave fewer levels or hold more entries than does a corresponding B-tree.\\nWe gave an overview of multiple key access methods, and we showed how an index \\ncan be constructed based on hash data structures. We introduced the concept of'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 677}, page_content='Review Questions  647\\npartitioned hashing , which is an extension of external hashing to deal with mul-\\ntiple keys. We also introduced grid files , which organize data into buckets along \\nmultiple dimensions, We discussed the hash index  in some detail—it is a second-\\nary structure to access the file by using hashing on a search key other than that used for the primary organization. Bitmap indexing  is another important type of \\nindexing used for querying by multiple keys and is particularly applicable on fields with a small number of unique values. Bitmaps can also be used at the leaf nodes of B\\n+ tree indexes as well. We also discussed function-based indexing, which is being \\nprovided by relational vendors to allow special indexes on a function of one or more attributes.\\nWe introduced the concept of a logical index and compared it with the physical \\nindexes we described before. They allow an additional level of indirection in index-ing in order to permit greater freedom for movement of actual record locations on disk. We discussed index creation in SQL, the process of bulk loading of index files and indexing of strings. We discussed circumstances that point to tuning of indexes. Then we reviewed some general topics related to indexing, including managing constraints, using inverted indexes, and using indexing hints in queries; we com-mented on column-based storage of relations, which is becoming a viable alterna-tive for storing and accessing large databases. Finally, we discussed physical database design of relational databases, which involves decisions related to storage and accessing of data that we have been discussing in the current and the previous chapter. This discussion was divided into factors that influence the design and the types of decisions regarding whether to index an attribute, what attributes to include in an index, clustered versus nonclustered indexes, hashed indexes, and dynamic hashing.\\nReview Questions\\n 17.1.

A \\nquery expressed in a high-level query language such as SQL must first be scanned, \\nparsed, and validated.2 The scanner  identifies the query tokens—such as SQL key-\\nwords, attribute names, and relation names—that appear in the text of the query, \\nwhereas the parser  checks the query syntax to determine whether it is formulated \\naccording to the syntax rules (rules of grammar) of the query language. The query \\nmust also be validated  by checking that all attribute and relation names are valid \\nand semantically meaningful names in the schema of the particular database being queried. An internal representation of the query is then created, usually as a tree data structure called a query tree . It is also possible to represent the query using a \\ngraph data structure called a query graph , which is generally a directed acyclic \\ngraph (DAG) . The DBMS must then devise an execution strategy  or query plan  \\nfor retrieving the results of the query from the database files. A query has many pos-sible execution strategies, and the process of choosing a suitable one for processing a query is known as query optimization .\\nWe defer a detailed discussion of query optimization to the next chapter. In this \\nchapter, we will primarily focus on how queries are processed and what algorithms are used to perform individual operations within the query. Figure 18.1 shows the different steps of processing a high-level query. The query optimizer  module has \\nthe task of producing a good execution plan, and the code generator  generates the \\ncode to execute that plan. The runtime database  processor  has the task of running \\n(executing) the query code, whether in compiled or interpreted mode, to produce the query result. If a runtime error results, an error message is generated by the runtime database processor.chapter 18\\n1We appreciate Rafi Ahmed’s contributions in updating this chapter.\\n2We will not discuss the parsing and syntax-checking phase of query processing here; this material  \\nis discussed in compiler texts.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 686}, page_content='656 Chapter 18 Strategies for Query Processing\\nThe term optimization  is actually a misnomer because in some cases the chosen \\nexecution plan is not the optimal (or absolute best) strategy—it is just a reasonably \\nefficient or the best available strategy  for executing the query. Finding the optimal \\nstrategy is usually too time-consuming—except for the simplest of queries. In addi-tion, trying to find the optimal query execution strategy requires accurate and detailed information about the size of the tables and distributions of things such as column values, which may not be always available in the DBMS catalog. Further-more, additional information such as the size of the expected result must be derived based on the predicates in the query. Hence, planning of a good execution strategy  \\nmay be a more accurate description than query optimization.\\nFor lower-level navigational database languages in legacy systems—such as the net-\\nwork DML or the hierarchical DL/1 the programmer must choose the query execu-tion strategy while writing a database program. If a DBMS provides only a navigational language, there is a limited opportunity  for extensive query optimiza-\\ntion by the DBMS; instead, the programmer is given the capability to choose the query execution strategy. On the other hand, a high-level query language—such as SQL for relational DBMSs (RDBMSs) or OQL (see Chapter 12) for object DBMSs (ODBMSs)—is more declarative in nature because it specifies what the intended results of the query are rather than identifying the details of how the result should \\nbe obtained.

Most DBMSs have a number of general database access algorithms that implement relational algebra operations such as \\nSELECT  or JOIN  (see Chapter 8) or combinations of these operations. Only \\nexecution strategies that can be implemented by the DBMS access algorithms and that apply to the particular query, as well as to the particular physical database design , \\ncan be considered by the query optimization module.\\nThis chapter is organized as follows. Section 18.1 starts with a general discussion of \\nhow SQL queries are typically translated into relational algebra queries and addi-\\ntional operations and then optimized. Then we discuss algorithms for implementing relational algebra operations in Sections 18.2 through 18.6. In Section 18.7, we dis-cuss the strategy for execution called pipelining. Section 18.8 briefly reviews the strategy for parallel execution of the operators. Section 18.9 summarizes the chapter.\\nIn the next chapter, we will give an overview of query optimization strategies. There \\nare two main techniques of query optimization that we will be discussing. The first technique is based on heuristic rules  for ordering the operations in a query execu-\\ntion strategy that works well in most cases but is not guaranteed to work well in every case. The rules typically reorder the operations in a query tree. The second technique involves cost estimation  of different execution strategies and choosing \\nthe execution plan that minimizes estimated cost. The topics covered in this chapter require that the reader be familiar with the material presented in several earlier chap-ters. In particular, the chapters on SQL (Chapters 6 and 7), relational algebra (Chap-ter 8), and file structures and indexing (Chapters 16 and 17) are a prerequisite to this chapter. Also, it is important to note that the topic of query processing and optimiza-tion is vast, and we can only give an introduction to the basic principles and tech-niques in this and the next chapter. Several important works are mentioned in the Bibliography of this and the next chapter.\\n18.1  Translating SQL Queries into Relational \\nAlgebra and Other Operators\\nIn practice, SQL is the query language that is used in most commercial RDBMSs. \\nAn SQL query is first translated into an equivalent extended relational algebra expression—represented as a query tree data structure—that is then optimized. Typically, SQL queries are decomposed into query blocks , which form the basic \\nunits that can be translated into the algebraic operators and optimized. A query \\nblock  contains a single \\nSELECT-FROM-WHERE  expression, as well as GROUP BY  \\n3There are some query processing and optimization issues and techniques that are pertinent only to \\nODBMSs. However, we do not discuss them here because we give only an introduction to query processing in this chapter and we do not discuss query optimization until Chapter 19.'),\n",

Hence, nested queries within a \\nquery are identified as separate query blocks. Because SQL includes aggregate operators—such as \\nMAX , MIN, SUM , and COUNT —these operators must also be \\nincluded in the extended algebra, as we discussed in Section 8.4.\\nConsider the following SQL query on the EMPLOYEE  relation in Figure 5.5:\\nSELECT  Lname, Fname\\nFROM  EMPLOYEE\\nWHERE  Salary  > ( SELECT  MAX  (Salary)\\n    FROM     EMPLOYEE\\n    WHERE   Dno =5 );\\nThis query retrieves the names of employees (from any department in the com-\\npany) who earn a salary that is greater than the highest salary in department 5 . The \\nquery includes a nested subquery and hence would be decomposed into two blocks. The inner block is:\\n( SELECT  MAX  (Salary)\\n  FROM     EMPLOYEE\\n  WHERE   Dno =5 )\\nThis retrieves the highest salary in department 5. The outer query block is:\\nSELECT   Lname, Fname\\nFROM    EMPLOYEE\\nWHERE  Salary  > c\\nwhere c represents the result returned from the inner block. The inner block could \\nbe translated into the following extended relational algebra expression:\\nℑMAX Salary (σDno=5(EMPLOYEE))\\nand the outer block into the expression:\\nπLname,Fname (σSalary>c (EMPLOYEE))\\nThe query optimizer  would then choose an execution plan for each query block. \\nNotice that in the above example, the inner block needs to be evaluated only once to \\nproduce the maximum salary of employees in department 5, which is then used—as \\nthe constant c—by the outer block. We called this a nested subquery block  (which is \\nuncorrelated to the outer query block ) in Section 7.1.2. It is more involved to opti-\\nmize the more complex correlated nested subqueries  (see Section 7.1.3), where a \\ntuple variable from the outer query block appears in the WHERE -clause of the inner \\nquery block. Many techniques are used in advanced DBMSs to unnest and optimize \\ncorrelated nested subqueries.\\n18.1.1 Additional Operators Semi-Join and Anti-Join\\nMost RDBMSs currently process SQL queries arising from various types of enterprise \\napplications that include ad hoc queries, standard canned queries with parameters,'),\n",

Additionally, SQL queries originate from OLAP \\n(online analytical processing) applications on data warehouses (we discuss data warehousing in detail in Chapter 29). Some of these queries are transformed into operations that are not part of the standard relational algebra we discussed in Chap-ter\\xa08. Two commonly used operations are semi-join  and anti-join . Note that both \\nthese operations are a type of join. Semi-join is generally used for unnesting EXISTS, IN, and ANY subqueries.\\n4 Here we represent semi-join by the following non- \\nstandard syntax: T1.X S = T2.Y, where T1 is the left table and T2 is the right table of \\nthe semi-join. The semantics of semi-join are as follows: A row of T1 is returned as soon as T1.X finds a match with any value of T2.Y without searching for further \\nmatches. This is in contrast to finding all possi ble matches in inner join.\\nConsider a slightly modified version of the schema in Figure 5.5 as follows:\\nEMPLOYEE ( Ssn, Bdate, Address, Sex, Salary, Dno)\\nDEPARTMENT ( Dnumber, Dname, Dmgrssn, Zipcode)\\nwhere a department is located in a specific zip code.\\nLet us consider the following query:\\nQ (SJ) : SELECT COUNT( *)\\nFROM  DEPARTMENT D\\nWHERE  D.Dnumber IN (  SELECT  E.Dno\\n            FROM  EMPLOYEE E\\n            WHERE  E.Salary > 200000)\\nHere we have a nested query which is joined by the connector IN.\\nTo remove the nested query:\\n( SELECT  E.Dno\\n  FROM  EMPLOYEE E WHERE  E.Salary > 200000)\\nis called as unnesting . It leads to the following query with an operation called \\nsemi-join,\\n5 which we show with a non-standard notation “ S=” below:\\nSELECT COUNT( *)\\nFROM  EMPLOYEE E, DEPARTMENT D\\nWHERE  D.Dnumber S= E.Dno and E.Salary > 200000;\\nThe above query is counting the number of departments that have employees who \\nmake more than $200,000 annually. Here, the operation is to find the department \\nwhose Dnumber attribute matches the value(s) for the Dno attribute of Employee with that high salary.\\n4In some cases where duplicate rows are not relevant, inner join can also be used to unnest EXISTS  \\nand ANY subqueries.\\n5Note that this semi-join operator is not the same as that used in distributed query processing.'),\n",

We are only interested in producing a \\ncount of such employees, and performing an inner join of the two tables would, of course, produce wrong results.

We \\nrepresent anti-join by the following nonstandard syntax: T1.x A = T2.y, where T1 is \\nthe left table and T2 is the right table of the anti-join. The semantics of anti-join are as follows: A row of T1 is rejected as soon as T1.x finds a match with any value  of T2.y. A row of T1 is returned, only if T1.x does not match with any value of T2.y.\\nIn the following result of unnesting, we show the aforementioned anti-join with the \\nnonstandard symbol “ A=” in the following:\\nSELECT COUNT( *)\\nFROM  EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT\\nWHERE  EMPLOYEE.Dno A = DEPARTMENT AND  Zipcode =30332\\nIn algebra, alternate notations exist.

We will discuss one of these algorithms in this sec-\\ntion. Note that sorting of a particular file may be avoided if an appropriate index—such as a primary or clustering index (see Chapter 17)—exists on the desired file attribute to allow ordered access to the records of the file.\\nExternal sorting  refers to sorting algorithms that are suitable for large files of \\nrecords stored on disk that do not fit entirely in main memory, such as most data-\\nbase files.\\n6 The typical external sorting algorithm uses a sort-merge strategy , which \\nstarts by sorting small subfiles—called runs —of the main file and then merges the \\nsorted runs, creating larger sorted subfiles that are merged in turn. The sort-merge algorithm, like other database algorithms, requires buffer space  in main memory, \\nwhere the actual sorting and merging of the runs is performed. The basic algorithm, outlined in Figure 18.2, consists of two phases: the sorting phase and the merging phase. The buffer space in main memory is part of the DBMS cache —an area in the \\ncomputer’s main memory that is controlled by the DBMS. The buffer space is divided into individual buffers, where each buffer  is the same size in bytes as the size \\nof one disk block. Thus, one buffer can hold the contents of exactly one disk block .\\nIn the sorting phase , runs (portions or pieces) of the file that can fit in the available \\nbuffer space are read into main memory, sorted using an internal  sorting algorithm, \\nand written back to disk as temporary sorted subfiles (or runs). The size of each run and the number of initial runs ( n\\nR) are dictated by the number of file blocks ( b) \\nand the available buffer space ( nB). For example, if the number of available main \\nmemory buffers nB = 5 disk blocks and the size of the file b = 1,024 disk blocks, then \\nnR= ⎡(b/nB)⎤ or 205 initial runs each of size 5 blocks (except the last run, which will \\nhave only 4 blocks). Hence, after the sorting phase, 205 sorted runs (or 205 sorted \\nsubfiles of the original file) are stored as temporary subfiles on disk.\\nIn the merging phase , the sorted runs are merged during one or more merge passes . \\nEach merge pass can have one or more merge steps. The degree of merging ( dM) \\nis the number of sorted subfiles that can be merged in each merge step. During each \\nmerge step, one buffer block is needed to hold one disk block from each of the \\nsorted subfiles being merged, and one additional buffer is needed for containing \\none disk block of the merge result, which will produce a larger sorted file that is the result of merging several smaller sorted subfiles. Hence, d\\nM is the smaller of ( nB − 1) \\nand nR, and the number of merge passes is ⎡(log dM(nR))⎤. In our example, \\nwhere nB = 5, dM = 4 (four-way merging), so the 205 initial sorted runs would be \\nmerged 4 at a time in each step into 52 larger sorted subfiles at the end of the first \\nmerge pass. These 52 sorted files are then merged 4 at a time into 13 sorted files, \\nwhich are then merged into 4 sorted files, and then finally into 1 fully sorted file, \\nwhich means that four passes  are needed.\\n6Internal sorting algorithms  are suitable for sorting data structures, such as tables and lists, that can fit \\nentirely in main memory. These algorithms are described in detail in data structures and algorithms texts, and include techniques such as quick sort, heap sort, bubble sort, and many others. We do not discuss these here. Also, main-memory DBMSs such as HANA employ their own techniques for sorting.'),\n",

The following formula approxi-mates this cost:\\n(2 * b) + (2 * b * (log dM nR))\\nThe first term (2 * b) represents the number of block accesses for the sorting phase, \\nsince each file block is accessed twice: once for reading into a main memory buffer and once for writing the sorted records back to disk into one of the sorted subfiles.

If the selection condition involves an equality \\ncomparison on a key attribute  with a primary index—for example,  \\nSsn = ‘123456789’ in OP1 —use the primary index to retrieve the record. \\nNote that this condition retrieves a single record (at most).\\n ■S3b—Using a hash key.  If the selection condition involves an equality com-\\nparison on a key attribute  with a hash key—for example, Ssn = ‘123456789’ \\nin OP1 —use the hash key to retrieve the record. Note that this condition \\nretrieves a single record (at most).\\n ■S4—Using a primary index to retrieve multiple records.  If the comparison \\ncondition is >, >=, <, or <= on a key field with a primary index—for exam-\\nple, Dnumber  > 5 in OP2 —use the index to find the record satisfying the cor-\\nresponding equality condition ( Dnumber  = 5); then retrieve all subsequent \\nrecords in the (ordered) file. For the condition Dnumber  < 5, retrieve all the \\npreceding records.\\n ■S5—Using a clustering index to retrieve multiple records.  If the selection \\ncondition involves an equality comparison on a nonkey attribute  with a \\nclustering index—for example, Dno = 5 in OP3 —use the index to retrieve all \\nthe records satisfying the condition.\\n ■S6—Using a secondary (B+-tree) index on an equality comparison.  This \\nsearch method can be used to retrieve a single record if the indexing field is \\na key (has unique values) or to retrieve multiple records if the indexing field \\nis not a key . This can also be used for comparisons involving >, >=, <, or <=. \\nQueries involving a range of values (e.g., 3,000 <= Salary <= 4,000) in their selection are called range queries . In case of range queries, the B\\n+-tree index \\nleaf nodes contain the indexing field value in order—so a sequence of them \\nis used corresponding to the requested range of that field and provide record \\npointers to the qualifying records.\\n ■S7a—Using a bitmap index.  (See Section 17.5.2.) If the selection condi-\\ntion involves a set of values for an attribute (e.g., Dnumber in (3,27,49) \\nin OP6), the corresponding bitmaps for each value can be OR-ed to give \\nthe set of record ids that qualify. In this example, that amounts to  \\nOR-ing three bitmap vectors whose length is the same as the number of employees.\\n8Generally, binary search is not used in database searches because ordered files are not used unless \\nthey also have a corresponding primary index.'),\n",

In OP7, the selection con-\\ndition involves the expression ((Salary *Commission_pct) + Salary ). \\nIf there is a functional index defined as (as shown in Section 17.5.3):\\nCREATE INDEX  income_ix\\nON EMPLOYEE (Salary + (Salary *Commission_pct)); \\nthen this index can be used to retrieve employee records that qualify. Note \\nthat the exact way in which the function is written while creating the index is immaterial. \\nIn the next chapter, we discuss how to develop formulas that estimate the access \\ncost of these search methods in terms of the number of block accesses and access time. Method S1 ( linear search ) applies to any file, but all the other methods \\ndepend on having the appropriate access path on the attribute used in the selection condition. Method S2 ( binary search ) requires the file to be sorted on the search \\nattribute. The methods that use an index (S3a, S4, S5, and S6) are generally referred to as index searches , and they require the appropriate index to exist on the search \\nattribute. Methods S4 and S6 can be used to retrieve records in a certain range  in \\nrange queries . Method S7a ( bitmap index search ) is suitable for retrievals where \\nan attribute must match an enumerated set of values. Method S7b ( functional \\nindex search ) is suitable when the match is based on a function of one or more \\nattributes on which a functional index exists.\\n18.3.2 Search Methods for Conjunctive Selection\\nIf a condition of a SELECT  operation is a conjunctive condition —that is, if it is \\nmade up of several simple conditions connected with the AND  logical connective \\nsuch as OP4  above—the DBMS can use the following additional methods to \\nimplement the operation:\\n ■S8—Conjunctive selection using an individual index.  If an attribute \\ninvolved in any single simple condition  in the conjunctive select condition \\nhas an access path that permits the use of one of the methods S2 to S6, use that condition to retrieve the records and then check whether each retrieved record satisfies the remaining simple conditions  in the conjunctive select \\ncondition.\\n ■S9—Conjunctive selection using a composite index.  If two or more attri-\\nbutes are involved in equality conditions in the conjunctive select condition and a composite index (or hash structure) exists on the combined fields—for example, if an index has been created on the composite key (\\nEssn , Pno) of \\nthe WORKS_ON  file for OP5 —we can use the index directly.\\n ■S10—Conjunctive selection by intersection of record pointers.9 If second-\\nary indexes (or other access paths) are available on more than one of the fields involved in simple conditions in the conjunctive select condition, and if \\n9A record pointer uniquely identifies a record and provides the address of the record on disk; hence, it is \\nalso called the record identifier  or record id .'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 696}, page_content='666 Chapter 18 Strategies for Query Processing\\nthe indexes include record pointers (rather than block pointers), then each \\nindex can be used to retrieve the set of record pointers  that satisfy the indi-\\nvidual condition. The intersection  of these sets of record pointers gives the \\nrecord pointers that satisfy the conjunctive select condition, which are then used to retrieve those records directly. If only some of the conditions have secondary indexes, each retrieved record is further tested to determine whether it satisfies the remaining conditions.\\n10 In general, method S10 \\nassumes that each of the indexes is on a nonkey field  of the file, because if one \\nof the conditions is an equality condition on a key field, only one record will satisfy the whole condition. The bitmap and functional indexes discussed above in S7 are applicable for conjunctive selection on multiple attributes as well. For conjunctive selection on multiple attributes, the resulting bitmaps are AND-ed to produce the list of record ids; the same can be done when one or more set of record ids comes from a functional index.\\nWhenever a single condition specifies the selection—such as \\nOP1 , OP2 , or OP3 —\\nthe DBMS can only check whether or not an access path exists on the attribute \\ninvolved in that condition. If an access path (such as index or hash key or bitmap \\nindex or sorted file) exists, the method corresponding to that access path is used; \\notherwise, the brute force, linear search approach of method S1 can be used. Query \\noptimization for a SELECT  operation is needed mostly for conjunctive select condi-\\ntions whenever more than one  of the attributes involved in the conditions have an \\naccess path. The optimizer should choose the access path that retrieves the fewest \\nrecords  in the most efficient way by estimating the different costs (see Section 19.3) \\nand choosing the method with the least estimated cost.\\n18.3.3 Search Methods for Disjunctive Selection\\nCompared to a conjunctive selection condition, a disjunctive condition  (where \\nsimple conditions are connected by the OR logical connective rather than by AND ) \\nis much harder to process and optimize. For example, consider OP4′:\\nOP4′: σDno=5 OR Salary > 30000  OR Sex  =‘F’ (EMPLOYEE)\\nWith such a condition, the records satisfying the disjunctive condition are the \\nunion  of the records satisfying the individual conditions. Hence, if any one of the \\nconditions does not have an access path, we are compelled to use the brute force, linear search approach. Only if an access path exists on every  simple condition in \\nthe disjunction can we optimize the selection by retrieving the records satisfying each condition—or their record ids—and then applying the union  operation to \\neliminate duplicates.\\nAll the methods discussed in S1 through S7 are applicable for each simple condition \\nyielding a possible set of record ids. The query optimizer must choose the appropri-ate one for executing each \\nSELECT  operation in a query. This optimization uses \\n10The technique can have many variations—for example, if the indexes are logical indexes  that store primary \\nkey values instead of record pointers.'),\n",

The optimizer chooses the access method with the lowest estimated cost.\\n18.3.4 Estimating the Selectivity of a Condition\\nTo minimize the overall cost of query execution in terms of resources used and response time, the query optimizer receives valuable input from the system catalog, which contains crucial statistical information about the database.\\nInformation in the Database Catalog. A typical RDBMS catalog contains the \\nfollowing types of information:\\nFor each relation (table) r with schema R containing r\\nR tuples:\\n /box4The number of rows/records or its cardinality: | r(R) |. We will refer to the \\nnumber of rows simply as rR.\\n /box4The “width” of the relation (i.e., the length of each tuple in the relation) \\nthis length of tuple is referred to as R.\\n /box4The number of blocks that relation occupies in storage: referred to as bR.\\n /box4The blocking factor bfr, which is the number of tuples per block.\\nFor each attribute A in relation R:\\n /box4The number of distinct values of A in R: NDV ( A, R).\\n /box4The max and min values of attribute A in R: max ( A, R) and min ( A, R).\\nNote that many other forms of the statistics are possible and may be kept as needed. \\nIf there is a composite index on attributes < A, B>, then the NDV ( R, <A, B>) is of \\nsignificance. An effort is made to keep these statistics as accurate as possible; how-\\never, keeping them accurate up-to-the-minute is considered unnecessary since the \\noverhead of doing so in fairly active databases is too high. We will be revisiting \\nmany of the above parameters again in Section 19.3.2.\\nWhen the optimizer is choosing between multiple simple conditions in a conjunc-\\ntive select condition, it typically considers the selectivity  of each condition. The \\nselectivity ( sl) is defined as the ratio of the number of records (tuples) that satisfy \\nthe condition to the total number of records (tuples) in the file (relation), and thus it is a number between zero and one. Zero selectivity  means none of the records in \\nthe file satisfies the selection condition, and a selectivity of one means that all the records in the file satisfy the condition. In general, the selectivity will not be either of these two extremes, but will be a fraction that estimates the percentage of file records that will be retrieved.\\nAlthough exact selectivities of all conditions may not be available, estimates of \\n selectivities  are possible from the information kept in the DBMS catalog and are used \\nby the optimizer. For example, for an equality condition on a key attribute of relation r(R), s = 1/| r(R)|, where | r(R)| is the number of tuples in relation r(R). For an equality \\ncondition on a nonkey attribute with i distinct values, s  can be estimated by'),\n",

Under this assumption, | r(R)|/i records will satisfy an \\nequality condition on this attribute. For a range query with the selection condition,\\nA ≥ v, assuming uniform distribution,\\nsl = 0 if v > max (A, R)sl = max (A, R) – v / max (A, R) – min (A, R)\\nIn general, the number of records satisfying a selection condition with selectivity sl is \\nestimated to be | r(R)| * sl. The smaller this estimate is, the higher the desirability of \\nusing that condition first to retrieve records. For a nonkey attribute with NDV ( A, R) \\ndistinct values, it is often the case that those values are not uniformly distributed.\\nIf the actual distribution of records among the various distinct values of the attribute \\nis kept by the DBMS in the form of a histogram , it is possible to get more accurate \\nestimates of the number of records that satisfy a particular condition. We will discuss \\nthe catalog information and histograms in more detail in Section 19.3.3.\\n18.4 Implementing the JOI N Operation\\nThe JOIN  operation is one of the most time-consuming operations in query pro-\\ncessing. Many of the join operations encountered in queries are of the EQUIJOIN  \\nand NATURAL JOIN  varieties, so we consider just these two here since we are only \\ngiving an overview of query processing and optimization. For the remainder of this chapter, the term join refers to an \\nEQUIJOIN  (or NATURAL JOIN ).\\nThere are many possible ways to implement a two-way join , which is a join on two \\nfiles. Joins involving more than two files are called multiway joins . The number of \\npossible ways to execute multiway joins grows rapidly because of the combinatorial explosion of possible join orderings. In this section, we discuss techniques for implementing only two-way joins . To illustrate our discussion, we refer to the rela-\\ntional schema shown in Figure 5.5 once more—specifically, to the \\nEMPLOYEE , \\nDEPARTMENT , and PROJECT  relations. The algorithms we discuss next are for a join \\noperation of the form:\\nR  A=B S\\nwhere A and B are the join attributes , which should be domain-compatible attri-\\nbutes of R and S, respectively. The methods we discuss can be extended to more \\ngeneral forms of join. We illustrate four of the most common techniques for per-forming such a join, using the following sample operations:\\nOP6: EMPLOYEE  Dno=Dnumber  DEPARTMENT\\nOP7: DEPARTMENT  Mgr_ssn =Ssn EMPLOYEE\\n18.4.1 Methods for Implementing Joins\\n ■J1—Nested-loop join (or nested-block join).

For each record t in R (outer loop), retrieve every record s from S (inner \\nloop) and test whether the two records satisfy the join condition t[A] = s[B].11\\n ■J2—Index-based nested-loop join (using an access structure to retrieve \\nthe matching records).  If an index (or hash key) exists for one of the two \\njoin attributes—say, attribute B of file S—retrieve each record t in R (loop \\nover file R), and then use the access structure (such as an index or a hash \\nkey) to retrieve directly all matching records s from S that satisfy s[B] = t[A].\\n ■J3—Sort-merge join.  If the records of R and S are physically sorted  (ordered) \\nby value of the join attributes A and B, respectively, we can implement the join \\nin the most efficient way possible. Both files are scanned concurrently in order of the join attributes, matching the records that have the same values for A and \\nB. If the files are not sorted, they may be sorted first by using external sorting \\n(see Section 18.2). In this method, pairs of file blocks are copied into memory buffers in order and the records of each file are scanned only once each for matching with the other file—unless both A and B are nonkey attributes, in \\nwhich case the method needs to be modified slightly. A sketch of the sort-merge join algorithm is given in Figure 18.3(a). We use R(i) to refer to the ith \\nrecord in file R. A variation of the sort-merge join can be used when secondary \\nindexes exist on both join attributes. The indexes provide the ability to access (scan) the records in order of the join attributes, but the records themselves are physically scattered all over the file blocks, so this method may be ineffi-cient because every record access may involve accessing a different disk block.\\n ■J4—Partition-hash join (or just hash-join).  The records of files R and S are \\npartitioned into smaller files. The partitioning of each file is done using the \\nsame hashing function h on the join attribute A of R (for partitioning file R) \\nand B of S (for partitioning file S). First, a single pass through the file with \\nfewer records (say, R) hashes its records to the various partitions of R; this is \\ncalled the partitioning phase , since the records of R are partitioned into the \\nhash buckets. In the simplest case, we assume that the smaller file can fit \\nentirely in main memory after it is partitioned, so that the partitioned subfiles \\nof R are all kept in main memory. The collection of records with the same \\nvalue of h(A) are placed in the same partition, which is a hash bucket  in a hash \\ntable in main memory. In the second phase, called the probing phase , a single \\npass through the other file ( S) then hashes each of its records using the same \\nhash function h(B) to probe  the appropriate bucket, and that record is com-\\nbined with all matching records from R in that bucket. This simplified descrip-\\ntion of partition-hash join assumes that the smaller of the two files fits entirely \\ninto memory buckets  after the first phase. We will discuss the general case of \\npartition-hash join below that does not require this assumption. In practice, techniques J1 to J4 are implemented by accessing whole disk blocks  of a file, \\nrather than individual records. Depending on the available number of buffers in memory, the number of blocks read in from the file can be adjusted.\\n11For disk files, it is obvious that the loops will be over disk blocks, so this technique has also been called \\nnested-block join .'),\n",

Looking again at the operation \\nOP6  above, assume that the number of buffers available in main memory for imple-\\nmenting the join is nB = 7 blocks (buffers). Recall that we assume that each memory \\nbuffer is the same size as one disk block. For illustration, assume that the DEPARTMENT  \\nfile consists of rD = 50 records stored in bD = 10 disk blocks and that the EMPLOYEE  \\nfile consists of rE = 6,000 records stored in bE = 2,000 disk blocks. It is advantageous \\nto read as many blocks as possible at a time into memory from the file whose records are used for the outer loop. Note that keeping one block for reading from the inner file and one block for writing to the output file, n\\nB − 2 blocks are available to read \\nfrom the outer relation, The algorithm can then read one block at a time for the inner-loop file and use its records to probe  (that is, search) the outer-loop blocks \\nthat are currently in main memory for matching records. This reduces the total \\nnumber of block accesses. An extra buffer in main memory is needed to contain \\nthe resulting records after they are joined, and the contents of this result buffer can \\nbe appended to the result file —the disk file that will contain the join result—\\nwhenever it is filled. This result buffer block then is reused to hold additional join \\nresult records.\\nIn the nested-loop join, it makes a difference which file is chosen for the outer loop \\nand which for the inner loop. If \\nEMPLOYEE  is used for the outer loop, each block of \\nEMPLOYEE  is read once, and the entire DEPARTMENT  file (each of its blocks) is read \\nonce for each time  we read in ( nB – 2) blocks of the EMPLOYEE  file. We get the fol-\\nlowing formulas for the number of disk blocks that are read from disk to main memory:\\nTotal number of blocks accessed (read) for outer-loop file = b\\nE\\nNumber of times ( nB − 2) blocks of outer file are loaded into main mem-\\nory = ⎡bE/(nB – 2)⎤\\nTotal number of blocks accessed (read) for inner-loop file = bD * ⎡bE/(nB – 2)⎤\\nHence, we get the following total number of block read accesses:\\nbE + ( ⎡bE/(nB − 2)⎤ * bD) = 2000 + ( ⎡(2000/5) ⎤ * 10) = 6000 block accesses\\nOn the other hand, if we use the DEPARTMENT  records in the outer loop, by sym-\\nmetry we get the following total number of block accesses:\\nbD + ( ⎡bD/(nB − 2)⎤ * bE) = 10 + ( ⎡(10/5) ⎤ * 2000) = 4010 block accesses\\nThe join algorithm uses a buffer to hold the joined records of the result file. Once \\nthe buffer is filled, it is written to disk and its contents are appended to the result file, and then refilled with join result records.\\n12\\n12If we reserve two buffers for the result file, double buffering can be used to speed the algorithm (see \\nSection 16.3).'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 703}, page_content='18.4 Implementing the JOIN Operation  673\\nIf the result file of the join operation has bRES disk blocks, each block is written once \\nto disk, so an additional bRES block accesses (writes) should be added to the preced-\\ning formulas in order to estimate the total cost of the join operation. The same holds for the formulas developed later for other join algorithms. As this example shows, it is advantageous to use the file with fewer blocks  as the outer-loop file in the \\nnested-loop join.\\n18.4.3  How the Join Selection Factor Affects  \\nJoin Performance\\nAnother factor that affects the performance of a join, particularly the single-loop \\nmethod J2, is the fraction of records in one file that will be joined with records in the other file. We call this the join selection factor\\n13 of a file with respect to an \\nequijoin condition with another file. This factor depends on the particular equijoin condition between the two files. To illustrate this, consider the operation \\nOP7 , \\nwhich joins each DEPARTMENT  record with the EMPLOYEE  record for the manager \\nof that department. Here, each DEPARTMENT  record (there are 50 such records in \\nour example) will be joined with a single  EMPLOYEE  record, but many EMPLOYEE  \\nrecords (the 5,950 of them that do not manage a department) will not be joined with any record from \\nDEPARTMENT .\\nSuppose that secondary indexes exist on both the attributes Ssn of EMPLOYEE  and \\nMgr_ssn  of DEPARTMENT , with the number of index levels xSsn = 4 and xMgr_ssn = 2, \\nrespectively. We have two options for implementing method J2. The first retrieves each \\nEMPLOYEE  record and then uses the index on Mgr_ssn  of DEPARTMENT  to find \\na matching DEPARTMENT  record. In this case, no matching record will be found for \\nemployees who do not manage a department. The number of block accesses for this case is approximately:\\nb\\nE + (rE * (xMgr_ssn  + 1)) = 2000 + (6000 * 3) = 20,000 block accesses\\nThe second option retrieves each DEPARTMENT  record and then uses the index on \\nSsn of EMPLOYEE  to find a matching manager EMPLOYEE  record. In this case, every \\nDEPARTMENT  record will have one matching EMPLOYEE  record. The number of \\nblock accesses for this case is approximately:\\nbD + (rD * (xSsn + 1)) = 10 + (50 * 5) = 260 block accesses\\nThe second option is more efficient because the join selection factor of DEPART MENT  \\nwith respect to the join condition  Ssn = Mgr_ssn  is 1 (every record in DEPARTMENT   \\nwill be joined), whereas the join selection factor of EMPLOYEE  with respect to the \\nsame join condition is (50/6,000), or 0.008 (only 0.8% of the records in EMPLOYEE  \\nwill be joined). For method J2, either the smaller file or the file that has a match for every record (that is, the file with the high join selection factor) should be used in the (single) join loop. It is also possible to create an index specifically for perform-\\ning the join operation if one does not already exist.\\n13This is different from the join selectivity , which we will discuss in Chapter 19.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 704}, page_content='674 Chapter 18 Strategies for Query Processing\\nThe sort-merge join J3 is quite efficient if both files are already sorted by their join \\nattribute. Only a single pass is made through each file. Hence, the number of blocks accessed is equal to the sum of the numbers of blocks in both files. For this method, both \\nOP6  and OP7  would need bE + bD = 2,000 + 10 = 2,010 block accesses. How-\\never, both files are required to be ordered by the join attributes; if one or both are not, a sorted copy of each file must be created specifically for performing the join operation. If we roughly estimate the cost of sorting an external file by ( b log\\n2b) \\nblock accesses, and if both files need to be sorted, the total cost of a sort-merge join can be estimated by ( b\\nE + bD + bE log 2bE + bD log 2bD).14\\n18.4.4 General Case for Partition-Hash Join\\nThe hash-join method J4 is also efficient.

If the hash table for the smaller of the two files can be kept entirely in main memory after hashing (parti-tioning) on its join attribute, the implementation is straightforward. If, however, the partitions of both files must be stored on disk, the method becomes more com-plex, and a number of variations to improve the efficiency have been proposed. We discuss two techniques: the general case of partition-hash join  and a variation called \\nhybrid hash-join algorithm , which has been shown to be efficient.\\nIn the general case of partition-hash join , each file is first partitioned into M parti-\\ntions using the same partitioning hash function  on the join attributes. Then, each \\npair of corresponding partitions is joined. For example, suppose we are joining relations R and S on the join attributes R.A and S.B:\\nR \\n A=B S\\nIn the partitioning phase , R is partitioned into the M partitions R1, R2, … , RM, and S \\ninto the M partitions S1, S2, …, SM. The property of each pair of corresponding parti-\\ntions Ri, Si with respect to the join operation is that records in Ri only need to be joined  \\nwith records in Si, and vice versa. This property is ensured by using the same hash \\nfunction  to partition both files on their join attributes—attribute A for R and attribute \\nB for S. The minimum number of in-memory buffers needed for the partitioning \\nphase  is M + 1. Each of the files R and S is partitioned separately. During partitioning \\nof a file, M in-memory buffers are allocated to store the records that hash to each par-\\ntition, and one additional buffer is needed to hold one block at a time of the input file being partitioned. Whenever the in-memory buffer for a partition gets filled, its con-tents are appended to a disk subfile  that stores the partition. The partitioning phase \\nhas two iterations.  After the first iteration, the first file R is partitioned into the subfiles \\nR\\n1, R2, … , RM, where all the records that hashed to the same buffer are in the same \\npartition. After the second iteration, the second file S is similarly partitioned.\\nIn the second phase, called the joining  or probing phase , M iterations  are needed. \\nDuring iteration i, two corresponding partitions Ri and Si are joined. The minimum \\n14We can use the more accurate formulas from Section 19.5 if we know the number of available buffers \\nfor sorting.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 705}, page_content='18.4 Implementing the JOIN Operation  675\\nnumber of buffers needed for iteration i is the number of blocks in the smaller of \\nthe two partitions, say Ri, plus two additional buffers. If we use a nested-loop join \\nduring iteration i, the records from the smaller of the two partitions Ri are copied \\ninto memory buffers; then all blocks from the other partition Si are read—one at a \\ntime—and each record is used to probe  (that is, search) partition Ri for matching \\nrecord(s). Any matching records are joined and written into the result file. To improve the efficiency of in-memory probing, it is common to use an in-memory \\nhash table  for storing the records in partition R\\ni by using a different  hash func-\\ntion from the partitioning hash function.15\\nWe can approximate the cost of this partition hash-join as 3 * (bR + bS) + bRES for our \\nexample, since each record is read once and written back to disk once during the partitioning phase. During the joining (probing) phase, each record is read a second time to perform the join. The main difficulty  of this algorithm is to ensure that the \\npartitioning hash function is uniform —that is, the partition sizes are nearly equal in \\nsize. If the partitioning function is skewed  (nonuniform), then some partitions may \\nbe too large to fit in the available memory space for the second joining phase.\\nNotice that if the available in-memory buffer space n\\nB > (bR + 2), where bR is the \\nnumber of blocks for the smaller  of the two files being joined, say R, then there is no \\nreason to do partitioning since in this case the join can be performed entirely in \\nmemory using some variation of the nested-loop join based on hashing and probing. For illustration, assume we are performing the join operation \\nOP6 , repeated below:\\nOP6: EMPLOYEE  Dno=Dnumber  DEPARTMENT\\nIn this example, the smaller file is the DEPARTMENT  file; hence, if the number of \\navailable memory buffers nB > (bD + 2), the whole DEPARTMENT  file can be read \\ninto main memory and organized into a hash table on the join attribute. Each \\nEMPLOYEE  block is then read into a buffer, and each EMPLOYEE  record in the buf-\\nfer is hashed on its join attribute and is used to probe  the corresponding in-memory \\nbucket in the DEPARTMENT  hash table. If a matching record is found, the records \\nare joined, and the result record(s) are written to the result buffer and eventually to the result file on disk. The cost in terms of block accesses is hence ( b\\nD + bE), plus \\nbRES—the cost of writing the result file.\\n18.4.5 Hybrid Hash-Join\\nThe hybrid hash-join algorithm  is a variation of partition hash-join, where the join-\\ning phase for one of the partitions  is included in the partitioning  phase. To illustrate \\nthis, let us assume that the size of a memory buffer is one disk block; that nB such \\nbuffers are available ; and that the partitioning hash function used is h(K) =  \\nK mod M, so that M partitions are being created, where M < nB. For illustration, \\nassume we are performing the join operation OP6 . In the first pass  of the partitioning \\nphase, when the hybrid hash-join algorithm is partitioning the smaller of the two files \\n15If the hash function used for partitioning is used again, all records in a partition will hash to the same \\nbucket again.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 706}, page_content='676 Chapter 18 Strategies for Query Processing\\n(DEPARTMENT  in OP6 ), the algorithm divides the buffer space among the M parti-\\ntions such that all the blocks of the first partition  of DEPARTMENT  completely reside \\nin main memory. For each of the other partitions, only a single in-memory buffer—whose size is one disk block—is allocated; the remainder of the partition is written to disk as in the regular partition-hash join. Hence, at the end of the first pass of the \\npartitioning phase,  the first partition of \\nDEPARTMENT  resides wholly in main mem-\\nory, whereas each of the other partitions of DEPARTMENT  resides in a disk subfile.\\nFor the second pass of the partitioning phase, the records of the second file being \\njoined—the larger file, EMPLOYEE  in OP6 —are being partitioned. If a record \\nhashes to the first partition,  it is joined with the matching record in DEPARTMENT  \\nand the joined records are written to the result buffer (and eventually to disk). If an \\nEMPLOYEE  record hashes to a partition other than the first, it is partitioned \\nnormally and stored to disk. Hence, at the end of the second pass of the partition-ing phase, all records that hash to the first partition have been joined. At this point, there are M − 1 pairs of partitions on disk. Therefore, during the second joining  or \\nprobing  phase, M − 1 iterations  are needed instead of M. The goal is to join as \\nmany records during the partitioning phase so as to save the cost of storing those records on disk and then rereading them a second time during the joining phase.\\n18.5  Algorithms for PROJECT  \\nand Set Operations\\nA PROJECT  operation π <attribute list> (R) from relational algebra implies that after \\nprojecting R on only the columns in the list of attributes, any duplicates are removed \\nby treating the result strictly as a set of tuples. However, the SQL query:\\nSELECT  Salary\\nFROM  EMPLOYEE\\nproduces a list of salaries of all employees. If there are 10,000 employees and only 80 \\ndistinct values for salary, it produces a one column result with 10,000 tuples. This oper-ation is done by simple linear search by making a complete pass through the table.\\nGetting the true effect of the relational algebra π\\n<attribute list> (R) operator is straight-\\nforward to implement if <attribute list> includes a key of relation R, because in this \\ncase the result of the operation will have the same number of tuples as R, but with \\nonly the values for the attributes in <attribute list> in each tuple. If <attribute list> does not include a key of R, duplicate tuples must be eliminated.  This can be done by \\nsorting the result of the operation and then eliminating duplicate tuples, which appear consecutively after sorting. A sketch of the algorithm is given in Fig-ure 18.3(b). Hashing can also be used to eliminate duplicates: as each record is \\nhashed and inserted into a bucket of the hash file in memory, it is checked against those records already in the bucket; if it is a duplicate, it is not inserted in the bucket. It is useful to recall here that in SQL queries, the default is not to eliminate dupli-cates from the query result; duplicates are eliminated from the query result only if the keyword \\nDISTINCT  is included.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 707}, page_content='18.5 Algorithms for PROJECT and Set Operations  677\\nSet operations— UNION , INTERSECTION , SET DIFFERENCE , and CARTESIAN  \\nPRODUCT —are sometimes expensive to implement, since UNION,  \\nINTERSECTION, MINUS or SET DIFFERENCE are set operators and must always return distinct results.\\nIn particular, the \\nCARTESIAN  PRODUCT  operation R × S is expensive because its \\nresult includes a record for each combination of records from R and S. Also, each \\nrecord in the result includes all attributes of R and S. If R has n records and j attri-\\nbutes, and S has m records and k attributes, the result relation for R × S will have \\nn * m records and each record will have j + k attributes. Hence, it is important to \\navoid the CARTESIAN  PRODUCT  operation and to substitute other operations such \\nas join during query optimization. The other three set operations— UNION ,  \\nINTERSECTION , and SET DIFFERENCE16—apply only to type-compatible  (or \\nunion-compatible) relations, which have the same number of attributes and the same attribute domains. The customary way to implement these operations is to use variations of the sort-merge technique:  the two relations are sorted on the \\nsame attributes, and, after sorting, a single scan through each relation is sufficient to produce the result. For example, we can implement the \\nUNION  operation, R ∪ S, \\nby scanning and merging both sorted files concurrently, and whenever the \\nsame tuple exists in both relations, only one is kept in the merged result. For the \\nINTERSECTION  operation, R ∩ S, we keep in the merged result only those tuples \\nthat appear in both sorted relations.  Figure 18.3(c) to (e) sketches the implementa-\\ntion of these operations by sorting and merging. Some of the details are not \\nincluded in these algorithms.\\nHashing  can also be used to implement UNION , INTERSECTION , and SET  \\nDIFFERENCE . One table is first scanned and then partitioned into an in-memory \\nhash table with buckets, and the records in the other table are then scanned one at a \\ntime and used to probe the appropriate partition. For example, to implement R ∪ S, \\nfirst hash (partition) the records of R; then, hash (probe) the records of S, but do not \\ninsert duplicate records in the buckets. To implement R ∩ S, first partition the \\nrecords of R to the hash file. Then, while hashing each record of S, probe to check if \\nan identical record from R is found in the bucket, and if so add the record to the \\nresult file. To implement R – S, first hash the records of R to the hash file buckets. \\nWhile hashing (probing) each record of S, if an identical record is found in the \\nbucket, remove that record from the bucket.\\n18.5.1  Use of Anti-Join for SET DIFFERENCE  \\n(or EXCEPT or MINUS in SQL)\\nThe MINUS operator in SQL is transformed into an anti-join (which we introduced \\nin Section 18.1) as follows. Suppose we want to find out which departments have no employees in the schema of Figure 5.5:\\nSelect Dnumber from DEPARTMENT MINUS Select Dno from EMPLOYEE;\\n16SET DIFFERENCE is called MINUS or EXCEPT in SQL.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 708}, page_content='678 Chapter 18 Strategies for Query Processing\\ncan be converted into the following:\\nSELECT  DISTINCT DEPARTMENT.Dnumber\\nFROM  DEPARTMENT, EMPLOYEE\\nWHERE DEPARTMENT.Dnumber  A = EMPLOYEE.Dno\\nWe used the nonstandard notation for anti-join, “ A=”, where DEPARTMENT is on \\nthe left of anti-join and EMPLOYEE is on the right.\\nIn SQL, there are two variations of these set operations. The operations \\nUNION , INTERSECTION , and EXCEPT  or MINUS (the SQL keywords for the SET \\nDIFFERENCE  operation) apply to traditional sets, where no duplicate records \\nexist in the result. The operations UNION ALL , INTERSECTION ALL , and EXCEPT \\nALL apply to multisets (or bags). Thus, going back to the database of Figure 5.5, \\nconsider a query that finds all departments that employees are working on where at least one project exists controlled by that department, and this result is written as:\\nSELECT  Dno from EMPLOYEE\\nINTERSECT ALL\\nSELECT  Dum from PROJECT\\nThis would not eliminate any duplicates of Dno from EMPLOYEE while perform-\\ning the INTERSECTION. If all 10,000 employees are assigned to departments \\nwhere some project is present in the PROJECT relation, the result would be the list \\nof all the 10,000 department numbers including duplicates.. This can be accom-plished by the semi-join operation we introduced in Section 18.1 as follows:\\nSELECT DISTINCT  EMPLOYEE.Dno\\nFROM  DEPARTMENT, EMPLOYEE\\nWHERE EMPLOYEE.Dno\\n S = DEPARTMENT.Dnumber\\nIf INTERSECTION is used without the ALL, then an additional step of duplicate \\nelimination will be required for the selected department numbers.\\n18.6  Implementing Aggregate Operations  \\nand Different Types of JOI Ns\\n18.6.1 Implementing Aggregate Operations\\nThe aggregate operators ( MIN, MAX , COUNT , AVERAGE , SUM ), when applied to an \\nentire table, can be computed by a table scan or by using an appropriate index, if \\navailable. For example, consider the following SQL query:\\nSELECT  MAX (Salary)\\nFROM  EMPLOYEE ;\\nIf an (ascending) B+-tree index on Salary  exists for the EMPLOYEE  relation, then \\nthe optimizer can decide on using the Salary  index to search for the largest Salary  \\nvalue in the index by following the rightmost  pointer in each index node from the'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 709}, page_content='18.6 Implementing Aggregate Operations and Different Types of JOINs  679\\nroot to the rightmost leaf. That node would include the largest Salary  value as its \\nlast entry. In most cases, this would be more efficient than a full table scan of \\nEMPLOYEE , since no actual records need to be retrieved. The MIN function can be \\nhandled in a similar manner, except that the leftmost  pointer in the index is fol-\\nlowed from the root to leftmost leaf. That node would include the smallest Salary  \\nvalue as its first entry.\\nThe index could also be used for the AVERAGE  and SUM  aggregate functions, \\nbut only if it is a dense index —that is, if there is an index entry for every record \\nin the main file. In this case, the associated computation would be applied to the values in the index. For a nondense index , the actual number of records \\nassociated with each index value must be used for a correct computation. This can be done if the number of records associated with each value  in the index is \\nstored in each index entry. For the \\nCOUNT  aggregate function, the number of \\nvalues can be also computed from the index in a similar manner. If a COUNT( *) \\nfunction is applied to a whole relation, the number of records currently in each relation are typically stored in the catalog, and so the result can be retrieved directly from the catalog.\\nWhen a \\nGROUP BY  clause is used in a query, the aggregate operator must be applied \\nseparately to each group of tuples as partitioned by the grouping attribute. Hence, \\nthe table must first be partitioned into subsets of tuples, where each partition \\n(group) has the same value for the grouping attributes. In this case, the computa-\\ntion is more complex. Consider the following query:\\nSELECT  Dno , AVG(Salary) \\nFROM  EMPLOYEE\\nGROUP BY  Dno ;\\nThe usual technique for such queries is to first use either sorting  or hashing  on the \\ngrouping attributes to partition the file into the appropriate groups. Then the algo-rithm computes the aggregate function for the tuples in each group, which have the same grouping attribute(s) value. In the sample query, the set of \\nEMPLOYEE  tuples \\nfor each department number would be grouped together in a partition and the \\naverage salary computed for each group.\\nNotice that if a clustering index  (see Chapter 17) exists on the grouping attribute(s), \\nthen the records are already partitioned  (grouped) into the appropriate subsets. In \\nthis case, it is only necessary to apply the computation to each group.\\n18.6.2 Implementing Different Types of JOINs\\nIn addition to the standard JOIN (also called INNER JOIN in SQL), there are varia-\\ntions of JOIN that are frequently used. Let us briefly consider three of them below: \\nouter joins, semi-joins, and anti-joins.\\nOuter Joins.  In Section 6.4, we discussed the outer join operation , with its three \\nvariations: left outer join, right outer join, and full outer join. In Chapter 5, we'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 710}, page_content='680 Chapter 18 Strategies for Query Processing\\ndiscussed how these operations can be specified in SQL. The following is an exam-\\nple of a left outer join operation in SQL:\\nSELECT  E.Lname , E.Fname , D.Dname\\nFROM  (EMPLOYEE E LEFT OUTER JOIN  DEPARTMENT D ON E.Dno  = D. Dnumber );\\nThe result of this query is a table of employee names and their associated depart-\\nments. The table contains the same results as a regular (inner) join, with the excep-tion that if an \\nEMPLOYEE  tuple (a tuple in the left relation) does not have an \\nassociated department,  the employee’s name will still appear in the resulting table, \\nbut the department name would be NULL  for such tuples in the query result. Outer \\njoin can be looked upon as a combination of inner join and anti-join.\\nOuter join can be computed by modifying one of the join algorithms, such as \\nnested-loop join or single-loop join. For example, to compute a left outer join, we \\nuse the left relation as the outer loop or index-based nested loop because every tuple in the left relation must appear in the result. If there are matching tuples in the other relation, the joined tuples are produced and saved in the result. However, if no matching tuple is found, the tuple is still included in the result but is padded with \\nNULL  value(s). The sort-merge and hash-join algorithms can also be extended \\nto compute outer joins.\\nTheoretically, outer join can also be computed by executing a combination of rela-\\ntional algebra operators. For example, the left outer join operation shown above is equivalent to the following sequence of relational operations:\\n  1. Compute the (inner) JOIN  of the EMPLOYEE  and DEPARTMENT  tables.\\nTEMP1  ← πLname, Fname, Dname  (EMPLOYEE  Dno =Dnumber DEPARTMENT)\\n  2. Find the EMPLOYEE  tuples that do not appear in the (inner) JOIN  result.\\nTEMP2 ← πLname, Fname  (EMPLOYEE) − πLname, Fname (TEMP1)\\nThis minus operation can be achieved by performing an anti-join on  \\nLname, Fname between EMPLOYEE and TEMP1, as we discussed above in Section 18.5.2.\\n  3. Pad each tuple in TEMP2  with a NULL  Dname  field.\\nTEMP2 ← TEMP2 × NULL\\n  4. Apply the UNION  operation to TEMP1 , TEMP2  to produce the LEFT OUTER \\nJOIN  result.\\nRESULT ← TEMP1 ∪ TEMP2\\nThe cost of the outer join as computed above would be the sum of the costs of the \\nassociated steps (inner join, projections, set difference, and union). However, note \\nthat step 3 can be done as the temporary relation is being constructed in step 2; that \\nis, we can simply pad each resulting tuple with a NULL . In addition, in step 4, we \\nknow that the two operands of the union are disjoint (no common tuples), so there \\nis no need for duplicate elimination. So the preferred method is to use a combina-\\ntion of inner join and anti-join rather than the above steps since the algebraic'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 711}, page_content='18.7 Combining Operations Using Pipelining  681\\napproach of projection followed by set difference causes temporary tables to be \\nstored and processed multiple times.\\nThe right outer join can be converted to a left outer join by switching the operands \\nand hence needs no separate discussion. Full outer join  requires computing the \\nresult of inner join and then padding to the result extra tuples arising from unmatched tuples from both the left and right operand relations. Typically, full outer join would be computed by extending sort-merge or hashed join algorithms to account for the unmatched tuples.\\nImplementing Semi-Join and Anti-Join. In Section 18.1, we introduced these types \\nof joins as possible operations to which some queries with nested subqueries get \\nmapped. The purpose is to be able to perform some variant of join instead of evaluat-\\ning the subquery multiple times. Use of inner join would be invalid in these cases, since \\nfor every tuple of the outer relation, the inner join looks for all possible matches on the \\ninner relation. In semi-join, the search stops as soon as the first match is found and the tuple from outer relation is selected; in anti-join, search stops as soon as the first match is found and the tuple from outer relation is rejected. Both these types of joins can be implemented as an extension of the join algorithms we discussed in Section 18.4.\\nImplementing Non-Equi-Join  Join operation may also be performed when the \\njoin condition is one of inequality. In Chapter 6, we referred to this operation as theta-join.This functionality is based on a condition involving any operators, such as <, >, ≥, ≤, ≠, and so on. All of the join methods discussed are again applicable here with the exception that hash-based algorithms cannot be used.\\n18.7 Combining Operations Using Pipelining\\nA query specified in SQL will typically be translated into a relational algebra expres-sion that is a sequence of relational operations.  If we execute a single operation at a \\ntime, we must generate temporary files on disk to hold the results of these tempo-\\nrary operations, creating excessive overhead. Evaluating a query by creating and storing each temporary result and then passing it as an argument for the next oper-ator is called materialized evaluation . Each temporary materialized result is then \\nwritten to disk and adds to the overall cost of query processing.\\nGenerating and storing large temporary files on disk is time-consuming and can be \\nunnecessary in many cases, since these files will immediately be used as input to the next operation. To reduce the number of temporary files, it is common to generate query execution code that corresponds to algorithms for combinations of opera-tions in a query.\\nFor example, rather than being implemented separately, a \\nJOIN  can be combined \\nwith two SELECT  operations on the input files and a final PROJECT  operation on \\nthe resulting file; all this is implemented by one algorithm with two input files and \\na single output file. Rather than creating four temporary files, we apply the algo-\\nrithm directly and get just one result file.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 712}, page_content='682 Chapter 18 Strategies for Query Processing\\nIn Section 19.1, we discuss how heuristic relational algebra optimization can group \\noperations together for execution. Combining several operations into one and avoiding the writing of temporary results to disk is called pipelining  or stream-\\nbased processing .\\nIt is common to create the query execution code dynamically to implement multi-\\nple operations. The generated code for producing the query combines several algo-\\nrithms that correspond to individual operations. As the result tuples from one \\noperation are produced, they are provided as input for subsequent operations. For example, if a join operation follows two select operations on base relations, the tuples resulting from each select are provided as input for the join algorithm in a stream  or pipeline  as they are produced. The corresponding evaluation is consid-\\nered a pipelined evaluation . It has two distinct benefits:\\n ■Avoiding the additional cost and time delay incurred for writing the inter-\\nmediate results to disk.\\n ■Being able to start generating results as quickly as possible when the root \\noperator is combined with some of the operators discussed in the follow-\\ning section means that the pipelined evaluation can start generating tuples \\nof the result while rest of the pipelined intermediate tables are undergoing processing.\\n18.7.1 Iterators for implementing Physical Operations\\nVarious algorithms for algebraic operations involve reading some input in the form of one or more files, processing it, and generating an output file as a relation. If the \\noperation is implemented in such a way that it outputs one tuple at a time, then it can be regarded as an iterator . For example, we can devise a tuple-based imple-\\nmentation of the nested-loop join that will generate a tuple at a time as output. Iterators work in contrast with the materialization approach wherein entire rela-tions are produced as temporary results and stored on disk or main memory and are read back again by the next algorithm. The query plan that contains the query tree may be executed by invoking the iterators in a certain order. Many iterators may be active at one time, thereby passing results up the execution tree and avoid-ing the need for additional storage of temporary results. The iterator interface typi-cally consists of the following methods:\\n  1. Open (): This method initializes the operator by allocating buffers for its input and output and initializing any data structures needed for the opera-tor. It is also used to pass arguments such as selection conditions needed to perform the operation. It in turn calls Open() to get the arguments it needs.\\n  2. Get_Next (): This method calls the Get_next() on each of its input argu-ments and calls the code specific to the operation being performed on the inputs. The next output tuple generated is returned and the state of the iterator is updated to keep track of the amount of input processed. When no more tuples can be returned, it places some special value in the output buffer.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 713}, page_content='18.8 Parallel Algorithms for Query Processing  683\\n  3. Close(): This method ends the iteration after all tuples that can be generated \\nhave been generated, or the required/demanded number of tuples have been returned. It also calls Close() on the arguments of the iterator.\\nEach iterator may be regarded as a class for its implementation with the above \\nthree methods applicable to each instance of that class. If the operator to be imple-mented allows a tuple to be completely processed when it is received, it may be possible to use the pipelining strategy effectively. However, if the input tuples need to be examined over multiple passes, then the input has to be received as a materi-alized relation. This becomes tantamount to the Open () method doing most of the work and the benefit of pipelining not being fully achieved. Some physical opera-tors may not lend themselves to the iterator interface concept and hence may not support pipelining.\\nThe iterator concept may also be applied to access methods. Accessing a B\\n+-tree or \\na hash-based index may be regarded as a function that can be implemented as an iterator; it produces as output a series of tuples that meet the selection condition passed to the Open() method.\\n18.8 Parallel Algorithms for Query Processing\\nIn Chapter 2, we mentioned several variations of the client/server architectures, including two-tier and three-tier architectures. There is another type of architec-ture, called parallel database architecture , that is prevalent for data-intensive \\napplications. We will discuss it in further detail in Chapter 23 in conjunction with distributed databases and the big data and NOSQL emerging technologies.\\nThree main approaches have been proposed for parallel databases. They corre-\\nspond to three different hardware configurations of processors and secondary stor-age devices (disks) to support parallelism. In shared-memory architecture , \\nmultiple processors are attached to an interconnection network and can access a common main memory region. Each processor has access to the entire memory address space from all machines. The memory access to local memory and local cache is faster; memory access to the common memory is slower. This architecture suffers from interference because as more processors are added, there is increasing contention for the common memory. The second type of architecture is known as shared-disk architecture . In this architecture, every processor has its own mem-\\nory, which is not accessible from other processors. However, every machine has access to all disks through the interconnection network. Every processor may not necessarily have a disk of its own. We discussed two forms of enterprise-level sec-ondary storage systems in Section 16.11. Both storage area networks (SANs) and network attached storage (NAS) fall into the shared-disk architecture and lend \\nthemselves to parallel processing. They have different units of data transfer; SANs \\ntransfer data in units of blocks or pages to and from disks to processors; NAS \\nbehaves like a file server that transfers files using some file transfer protocol. In \\nthese systems, as more processors are added, there is more contention for the lim-ited network bandwidth.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 714}, page_content='684 Chapter 18 Strategies for Query Processing\\nThe above difficulties have led to shared-nothing architecture  becoming the most \\ncommonly used architecture in parallel database systems. In this architecture, each processor accesses its own main memory and disk storage. When a processor A requests data located on the disk D\\nB attached to processor B, processor A sends the \\nrequest as a message over a network to processor B, which accesses its own disk DB \\nand ships the data over the network in a message to processor A. Parallel databases \\nusing shared-nothing architecture are relatively inexpensive to build. Today, com-modity processors are being connected in this fashion on a rack, and several racks can be connected by an external network. Each processor has its own memory and disk storage.\\nThe shared-nothing architecture affords the possibility of achieving parallelism in \\nquery processing at three levels, which we will discuss below: individual operator parallelism, intraquery parallelism, and interquery parallelism. Studies have shown that by allocating more processors and disks, linear speed-up —a linear reduction \\nin the time taken for operations—is possible. Linear scale-up , on the other hand, \\nrefers to being able to give a constant sustained performance by increasing the number of processors and disks proportional to the size of data. Both of these are implicit goals of parallel processing.\\n18.8.1 Operator-Level Parallelism\\nIn the operations that can be implemented with parallel algorithms, one of the main strategies is to partition data across disks. Horizontal partitioning  of a relation \\ncorresponds to distributing the tuples across disks based on some partitioning \\nmethod. Given n disks, assigning the ith tuple to disk i mod n is called round-robin \\npartitioning . Under range partitioning , tuples are equally distributed (as much as \\npossible) by dividing the range of values of some attribute. For example, employee tuples from the EMPLOYEE relation may be assigned to 10 disks by dividing the age range into 10 ranges—say 22–25, 26–28, 29–30, and so on—such that each has \\nroughly one-tenth of the total number of employees. Range partitioning is a chal-\\nlenging operation and requires a good understanding of the distribution of data along the attribute involved in the range clause. The ranges used for partitioning are represented by the range vector . With hash partitioning , tuple i is assigned to \\nthe disk h(i), where h is the hashing function. Next, we briefly discuss how parallel \\nalgorithms are designed for various individual operations.\\nSorting. If the data has been range partitioned on an attribute—say, age—into n \\ndisks on n processors, then to sort the entire relation on age, each partition can be \\nsorted separately in parallel and the results can be concatenated. This potentially causes close to an n-fold reduction in the overall sorting time. If the relation has \\nbeen partitioned using another scheme, the following approaches are possible:\\n ■Repartition the relation by using range partitioning on the same attribute \\nthat is the target for sorting; then sort each partition individually followed \\nby concatenation, as mentioned above.\\n ■Use a parallel version of the external sort-merge algorithm shown in Figure 18.2.'),\n",

For a selection based on some condition, if the condition is an equality \\ncondition, < A = v> and the same attribute A has been used for range partitioning, the \\nselection can be performed on only that partition to which the value v belongs. In other \\ncases, the selection would be performed in parallel on all the processors and the results merged. If the selection condition is v1 ≤ A ≤ v2 and attribute A is used for range par-\\ntitioning, then the range of values ( v1, v2) must overlap a certain number of partitions. \\nThe selection operation needs to be performed only in those processors in parallel.\\nProjection and Duplicate Elimination. Projection without duplicate elimination \\ncan be achieved by performing the operation in parallel as data is read from each partition. Duplicate elimination can be achieved by sorting the tuples and discard-ing duplicates. For sorting, any of the techniques mentioned above can be used based on how the data is partitioned.\\nJoin. The basic idea of parallel join is to split the relations to be joined, say R and S, \\nin such a way that the join is divided into multiple n smaller joins, and then perform \\nthese smaller joins in parallel on n processors and take a union of the result. Next, \\nwe discuss the various techniques involved to achieve this.\\na. Equality-based partitioned join:  If both the relations R and S are parti-\\ntioned into n partitions on n processors such that partition ri and parti-\\ntion si are both assigned to the same processor Pi, then the join can be \\ncomputed locally provided the join is an equality join or natural join. Note that the partitions must be non-overlapping on the join key; in that sense, the partitioning is a strict set-theoretic partitioning. Furthermore, the attribute used in the join condition must also satisfy these conditions:\\n /box4It is the same as that used for range partitioning, and the ranges used \\nfor each partition are also the same for both R and S. Or,\\n /box4It is the same as that used to partition into n partitions using hash \\npartitioning. The same hash function must be used for R and S. If the \\ndistributions of values of the joining attribute are different in R and S, \\nit is difficult to come up with a range vector that will uniformly distrib-ute both R and S into equal partitions. Ideally, the size of | r\\ni | + | si | \\nshould be even for all partitions i. Otherwise, if there is too much data \\nskew, then the benefits of parallel processing are not fully achieved. The local join at each processor may be performed using any of the techniques discussed for join: sort merge, nested loop, and hash join.\\nb. Inequality join with partitioning and replication:  If the join condition \\nis an inequality condition, involving <, ≤, >, ≥, ≠, and so on, then it is not \\npossible to partition R and S in such a way that the ith partition of R—\\nnamely, ri— joins  the jth partition of S—namely, si only. Such a join can \\nbe parallelized in two ways:\\n /box4Asymmetric case : Partitioning a relation R using one of the partitioning \\nschemes; replicating one of the relations (say S) to all the n partitions; \\nand performing the join between ri and the entire S at processor Pi. \\nThis method is preferred when S is much smaller than R.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 716}, page_content='686 Chapter 18 Strategies for Query Processing\\n /box4Symmetric case : Under this general method, which is applicable to any \\ntype of join, both R and S are partitioned. R is partitioned n ways, and \\nS is partitioned m ways. A total of m * n processors are used for the \\nparallel join. These partitions are appropriately replicated so that pro-cessors P\\n0,0 thru Pn-1,m-1 (total of m * n processors) can perform the \\njoin locally. The processor Pi,j performs the join of ri with si using any \\nof the join techniques. The system replicates the partition ri to proces-\\nsors Pi,0, Pi,1 thru Pi,m-1. Similarly, partition si is replicated to processors  \\nP0,j, P1,j, P n-1,j. In general, partitioning with replication has a higher \\ncost than just partitioning; thus partitioning with replication costs more in the case of an equijoin.\\nc. Parallel partitioned hash join:  The partitioned hash join we described as \\nalgorithm J4 in Section 18.4 can be parallelized. The idea is that when R and S \\nare large relations, even if we partition each relation into n partitions equaling \\nthe number of processors, the local join at each processor can still be costly. This join proceeds as follows; assume that s is the smaller of r and s:\\n  1. Using a hash function h1 on the join attribute, map each tuple of rela-\\ntions r and s to one of the n processors. Let ri and si be the partitions \\nhashed to  Pi.. First,  read the s tuples at each processor on its local disk \\nand map them to the appropriate processor using h1.\\n  2. Within each processor  Pi, the tuples of S received in step 1 are parti-\\ntioned using a different hash function h2 to, say, k buckets. This step is \\nidentical to the partitioning phase of the partitioned hash algorithm \\nwe described as J4 in Section 18.4.\\n  3. Read the r tuples from each local disk at each processor and map them \\nto the appropriate processor using hashing function h1. As they are \\nreceived at each processor, the processor partitions them using the \\nsame hash function h2 used in step 2 for the k buckets; this process is \\njust as in the probing phase of algorithm J4.\\n  4. The processor Pi executes the partitioned hash algorithm locally on the \\npartitions ri and si using the joining phase on the k buckets (as \\ndescribed in algorithm J4) and produces a join result.\\nThe results from all processors P i are  independently computed and \\nunioned to produce  the final result.\\nAggregation. Aggregate operations with grouping are achieved by partitioning \\non the grouping attribute and then computing the aggregate function locally at each processor using any of the uni-processor algorithms. Either range partitioning or hash partitioning can be used.\\nSet Operations. For union, intersection, and set difference operations, if the \\nargument relations R and S are partitioned using the same hash function, they can \\nbe done in parallel on each processor. If the partitioning is based on unmatched criteria, R and S may need to be redistributed using an identical hash function.'),\n",

A query execution plan can be modeled as a graph of operations. To achieve a parallel execution of a query, one approach is to use a parallel algorithm for each operation involved in the query, with appro-priate partitioning of the data input to that operation. Another opportunity to parallelize comes from the evaluation of an operator tree where some of the operations may be executed in parallel because they do not depend on one another. These operations may be executed on separate processors. If the out-put of one of the operations can be generated tuple-by-tuple and fed into another operator, the result is pipelined parallelism . An operator that does \\nnot produce any output until it has consumed all its inputs is said to block the \\npipelining .\\n18.8.3 Interquery Parallelism\\nInterquery parallelism refers to the execution of multiple queries in parallel. In \\nshared-nothing or shared-disk architectures, this is difficult to achieve. Activi-ties of locking, logging, and so on among processors (see the chapters in Part 9 on Transaction Processing) must be coordinated, and simultaneous conflicting updates of the same data by multiple processors must be avoided. There must be cache coherency , which guarantees that the processor updating a page has the \\nlatest version of that page in the buffer. The cache-coherency and concurrency control protocols (see Chapter 21) must work in coordination as well.\\nThe main goal behind interquery parallelism is to scale up (i.e., to increase the \\noverall rate at which queries or transactions can be processed by increasing the number of processors). Because single-processor multiuser systems themselves are designed to support concurrency control among transactions with the goal of increasing transaction throughput (see Chapter 21), database systems using shared memory parallel architecture can achieve this type of parallelism more easily without significant changes.\\nFrom the above discussion it is clear that we can speed up the query execution by \\nperforming various operations, such as sorting, selection, projection, join, and aggregate operations, individually using their parallel execution. We may achieve further speed-up by executing parts of the query tree that are independent in parallel on different processors. However, it is difficult to achieve interquery parallelism in shared-nothing parallel architectures. One area where the shared-disk architecture has an edge is that it has a more general applicability, since it, unlike the shared-nothing architecture, does not require data to be stored in a partitioned manner. Current SAN- and NAS-based systems afford this advan-tage. A number of parameters—such as available number of processors and available buffer space—play a role in determining the overall speed-up. A detailed discussion of the effect of these parameters is outside our scope.'),\n",

We first discussed how SQL queries are translated into relational algebra. We introduced the operations of semi-join and anti-join, to which certain nested queries are mapped to avoid doing the regular inner join. We discussed exter-nal sorting, which is commonly needed during query processing to order the tuples of a relation while dealing with aggregation, duplicate elimination, and so forth. We considered various cases of selection and discussed the algorithms employed for simple selection based on one attribute and complex selections using conjunctive and disjunctive clauses. Many techniques were discussed for the different selection types, including linear and binary search, use of B\\n+-tree index, bitmap indexes, clus-\\ntering index, and functional index. The idea of selectivity of conditions and the typi-cal information placed in a DBMS catalog was discussed. Then we considered the join operation in detail and proposed algorithms called nested-loop join, index-based nested-loop join, sort-merge join, and hash join.\\nWe gave illustrations of how buffer space, join selection factor, and inner–outer rela-\\ntion choice affect the performance of the join algorithms. We also discussed the hybrid hash algorithm, which avoids some of the cost of writing during the joining phase. We discussed algorithms for projection and set operations as well as algorithms for aggre-gation. Then we discussed the algorithms for different types of joins, including outer joins, semi-join, anti-join, and non-equi-join. We also discussed how operations can be combined during query processing to create pipelined or stream-based execution instead of materialized execution. We introduced how operators may be implemented \\nusing the iterator concept. We ended the discussion of query processing strategies with \\na quick introduction to the three types of parallel database system architectures.

The goal of \\nquery optimization is to select the best possible strategy for query evaluation. As we said before, the term optimization  is a misnomer because the chosen execution plan \\nmay not always be the most optimal plan possible. The primary goal is to arrive at the most efficient and cost-effective plan using the available information about the schema and the content of relations involved, and to do so in a reasonable amount of time. Thus a proper way to describe query optimization  would be that it is an \\nactivity conducted by a query optimizer in a DBMS to select the best available strat-egy for executing the query.\\nThis chapter is organized as follows. In Section 19.1 we describe the notation for \\nmapping of the queries from SQL into query trees and graphs. Most RDBMSs use an internal representation of the query as a tree. We present heuristics to transform the query into a more efficient equivalent form followed by a general procedure for applying those heuristics. In Section 19.2, we discuss the conversion of queries into execution plans. We discuss nested subquery optimization. We also present exam-ples of query transformation in two cases: merging of views in Group By queries and transformation of Star Schema queries that arise in data warehouses. We also briefly discuss materialized views. Section 19.3 is devoted to a discussion of selectiv-ity and result-size estimation and presents a cost-based approach to optimization. We revisit the information in the system catalog that we presented in Section 18.3.4 earlier and present histograms. Cost models for selection and join operation are presented in Sections 19.4 and 19.5. We discuss the join ordering problem, which is a critical one, in some detail in Section 19.5.3. Section 19.6 presents an example of cost-based optimization. Section 19.7 discusses some additional issues related to chapter 19\\n1The substantial contribution of Rafi Ahmed to this chapter is appreciated.'),\n",

Section 19.8 is devoted to a discussion of query optimization in \\ndata warehouses. Section 19.9 gives an overview of query optimization in Oracle. Section 19.10 briefly discusses semantic query optimization. We end the chapter with a summary in Section 19.11.\\n19.1  Query Trees and Heuristics  \\nfor Query Optimization\\nIn this section, we discuss optimization techniques that apply heuristic rules to modify \\nthe internal representation of a query—which is usually in the form of a query tree or a query graph data structure—to improve its expected performance. The scanner and parser of an SQL query first generate a data structure that corresponds to an initial \\nquery representation,  which is then optimized according to heuristic rules. This leads \\nto an optimized query representation , which corresponds to the query execution strat-\\negy. Following that, a query execution plan is generated to execute groups of opera-tions based on the access paths available on the files involved in the query.\\nOne of the main heuristic rules  is to apply \\nSELECT  and PROJECT  operations before  \\napplying the JOIN  or other binary operations, because the size of the file resulting \\nfrom a binary operation—such as JOIN —is usually a multiplicative function of the \\nsizes of the input files. The SELECT  and PROJECT  operations reduce the size of a file \\nand hence should be applied before  a join or other binary operation.\\nIn Section 19.1.1, we reiterate the query tree and query graph notations that we \\nintroduced earlier in the context of relational algebra and calculus in Sections 8.3.5 and 8.6.5, respectively. These can be used as the basis for the data structures that are used for internal representation of queries. A query tree  is used to represent a rela-\\ntional algebra  or extended relational algebra expression, whereas a query graph  is \\nused to represent a relational calculus expression . Then, in Section 19.1.2, we show \\nhow heuristic optimization rules are applied to convert an initial query tree into an equivalent query tree , which represents a different relational algebra expression \\nthat is more efficient to execute but gives the same result as the original tree. We also discuss the equivalence of various relational algebra expressions. Finally, Sec-tion 19.1.3 discusses the generation of query execution plans.\\n19.1.1 Notation for Query Trees and Query Graphs\\nA query tree  is a tree data structure that corresponds to an extended relational alge-\\nbra expression. It represents the input relations of the query as leaf nodes  of the tree, \\nand it represents the relational algebra operations as internal nodes. An execution of \\nthe query tree consists of executing an internal node operation whenever its operands \\nare available and then replacing that internal node by the relation that results from executing the operation. The order of execution of operations starts at the leaf nodes , \\nwhich represents the input database relations for the query, and ends at the root node , \\nwhich represents the final operation of the query. The execution terminates when the root node operation is executed and produces the result relation for the query.'),\n",

A more neutral data structure for representation of a query is the query \\ngraph  notation. Figure 19.1(c) (the same as shown in Figure 6.13) shows the query \\ngraph for query \\nQ2.

Such a canonical query tree  repre-\\nsents a relational algebra expression that is very inefficient if executed directly,  \\nbecause of the CARTESIAN PRODUCT  (×) operations. For example, if the PROJECT , \\nDEPARTMENT , and EMPLOYEE  relations had record sizes of 100, 50, and 150 bytes \\nand contained 100, 20, and 5,000 tuples, respectively, the result of the CARTESIAN \\nPRODUCT  would contain 10 million tuples of record size 300 bytes each.

First we discuss informally how a query tree is transformed by using heuristics, and then we discuss general transformation rules and show how they can be used in an algebraic heuristic optimizer.\\nExample of Transforming a Query. Consider the following query \\nQ on the \\ndatabase in Figure 5.5: Find the last names of employees born after 1957 who work on \\na project named ‘Aquarius’ . This query can be specified in SQL as follows:\\nQ: SELECT  E.Lname\\n FROM  EMPLOYEE E , WORKS_ON W, PROJECT P\\n WHERE   P.Pname =‘Aquarius’ AND  P.Pnumber=W.Pno AND  E.Essn=W.Ssn\\n  AND  E.Bdate  > ‘1957-12-31’;\\nThe initial query tree for Q is shown in Figure 19.2(a). Executing this tree directly \\nfirst creates a very large file containing the CARTESIAN PRODUCT  of the entire \\nEMPLOYEE , WORKS_ON , and PROJECT  files. That is why the initial query tree is \\nnever executed, but is transformed into another equivalent tree that is efficient to \\nexecute. This particular query needs only one record from the PROJECT  relation—\\nfor the ‘Aquarius’ project—and only the EMPLOYEE  records for those whose date of \\nbirth is after ‘1957-12-31’. Figure 19.2(b) shows an improved query tree that first \\napplies the SELECT  operations to reduce the number of tuples that appear in the \\nCARTESIAN PRODUCT .\\nA further improvement is achieved by switching the positions of the EMPLOYEE  \\nand PROJECT  relations in the tree, as shown in Figure 19.2(c). This uses the \\ninformation that Pnumber  is a key attribute of the PROJECT  relation, and hence \\nthe SELECT  operation on the PROJECT  relation will retrieve a single record \\nonly. We can further improve the query tree by replacing any CARTESIAN \\nPRODUCT  operation that is followed by a join condition as a selection with a \\nJOIN  operation, as shown in Figure 19.2(d). Another improvement is to keep \\nonly the attributes needed by subsequent operations in the intermediate rela-\\ntions, by including PROJECT  (π) operations as early as possible in the query \\ntree, as shown in Figure 19.2(e). This reduces the attributes (columns) of the \\nintermediate relations, whereas the SELECT  operations reduce the number of \\ntuples (records).'),\n",

If the selection condition c involves only those attri-\\nbutes A1, … , An in the projection list, the two operations can be commuted:\\nπA1, A2, … , An (σc (R)) ≡ σc (πA1, A2, … , An (R))\\n  5. Commutativity of  (and ×).  The join operation is commutative, as is the × \\noperation:\\nR c S ≡ S c R\\nR × S ≡ S × R\\nNotice that although the order of attributes may not be the same in the rela-\\ntions resulting from the two joins (or two Cartesian products), the meaning  \\nis the same because the order of attributes is not important in the alternative definition of relation.\\n  6. Commuting σ with  (or ×).  If all the attributes in the selection condition c \\ninvolve only the attributes of one of the relations being joined—say, R—the \\ntwo operations can be commuted as follows:\\nσc (R  S) ≡ (σc (R))  S\\nAlternatively, if the selection condition c can be written as ( c1 AND  c2), where \\ncondition c1 involves only the attributes of R and condition c2 involves only \\nthe attributes of S, the operations commute as follows:\\nσc (R  S) ≡ (σc1 (R))  (σc2 (S))\\nThe same rules apply if the  is replaced by a × operation.\\n  7. Commuting π with  (or ×).  Suppose that the projection list is L = {A1, … , \\nAn, B1, … , Bm} , where A1, … , An are attributes of R and B1, … , Bm are \\nattributes of S. If the join condition c involves only attributes in L, the two \\noperations can be commuted as follows:\\nπL (R c S) ≡ (πA1, … , An (R)) c (πB1, … , Bm (S))\\nIf the join condition c contains additional attributes not in L, these must be added \\nto the projection list, and a final π operation is needed. For example, if attributes'),\n",

Commutativity of set operations.  The set operations ∪ and ∩ are commu-\\ntative, but − is not.\\n  9. Associativity of , ×, ∪, and ∩. These four operations are individually asso-\\nciative; that is, if both occurrences of θ stand for the same operation that is \\nany one of these four operations (throughout the expression), we have:\\n(R θ S) θ T ≡ R θ (S θ T)\\n 10. Commuting σ with set operations.  The σ operation commutes with ∪, ∩, \\nand −.

We can now out-\\nline the steps of an algorithm that utilizes some of the above rules to transform an initial query tree into a final tree that is more efficient to execute (in most cases). The algorithm will lead to transformations similar to those discussed in our exam-ple in Figure 19.2. The steps of the algorithm are as follows:\\n  1. Using Rule 1, break up any SELECT  operations with conjunctive conditions \\ninto a cascade of SELECT  operations. This permits a greater degree of free-\\ndom in moving SELECT  operations down different branches of the tree.\\n  2. Using Rules 2, 4, 6, and 10, 13, 14 concerning the commutativity of SELECT  \\nwith other operations, move each SELECT  operation as far down the query \\ntree as is permitted by the attributes involved in the select condition. If the condition involves attributes from only one table , which means that it repre-\\nsents a selection condition , the operation is moved all the way to the leaf \\nnode that represents this table. If the condition involves attributes from two \\ntables , which means that it represents a join condition , the condition is \\nmoved to a location down the tree after the two tables are combined.\\n  3. Using Rules 5 and 9 concerning commutativity and associativity of binary oper-ations, rearrange the leaf nodes of the tree using the following criteria. First, position the leaf node relations with the most restrictive \\nSELECT  operations so \\nthey are executed first in the query tree representation. The definition of most \\nrestrictive  SELECT  can mean either the ones that produce a relation with the \\nfewest tuples or with the smallest absolute size.4 Another possibility is to define \\nthe most restrictive SELECT  as the one with the smallest selectivity; this is more \\npractical because estimates of selectivities are often available in the DBMS  \\ncatalog. Second, make sure that the ordering of leaf nodes does not cause  \\nCARTESIAN PRODUCT  operations; for example, if the two relations with the \\nmost restrictive SELECT  do not have a direct join condition between them, it \\nmay be desirable to change the order of leaf nodes to avoid Cartesian products.5\\n  4. Using Rule 12, combine a CARTESIAN PRODUCT  operation with a subse-\\nquent SELECT  operation in the tree into a JOIN  operation, if the condition \\nrepresents a join condition.\\n  5. Using Rules 3, 4, 7, and 11 concerning the cascading of PROJECT  and the com-\\nmuting of PROJECT  with other operations, break down and move lists of pro-\\njection attributes down the tree as far as possible by creating new PROJECT  \\noperations as needed. Only those attributes needed in the query result and in \\nsubsequent operations in the query tree should be kept after each PROJECT  \\noperation.\\n4Either definition can be used, since these rules are heuristic.\\n5Note that a CARTESIAN PRODUCT is acceptable in some cases—for example, if each relation has only \\na single tuple because each had a previous select condition on a key field.'),\n",

Identify subtrees that represent groups of operations that can be executed by \\na single algorithm.\\nIn our example, Figure 19.2(b) shows the tree in Figure 19.2(a) after applying steps 1 \\nand 2 of the algorithm; Figure 19.2(c) shows the tree after step 3; Figure 19.2(d) after step 4; and Figure 19.2(e) after step 5. In step 6, we may group together the operations in the subtree whose root is the operation π\\nEssn into a single algorithm. \\nWe may also group the remaining operations into another subtree, where the tuples resulting from the first algorithm replace the subtree whose root is the operation π\\nEssn, because the first grouping means that this subtree is executed first.\\nSummary of Heuristics for Algebraic Optimization. The main heuristic is to \\napply first the operations that reduce the size of intermediate results. This includes performing as early as possible \\nSELECT  operations to reduce the number of tuples \\nand PROJECT  operations to reduce the number of attributes—by moving SELECT  \\nand PROJECT  operations as far down the tree as possible. Additionally, the SELECT  \\nand JOIN  operations that are most restrictive—that is, result in relations with the \\nfewest tuples or with the smallest absolute size—should be executed before other \\nsimilar operations. The latter rule is accomplished through reordering the leaf \\nnodes of the tree among themselves while avoiding Cartesian products, and adjust-\\ning the rest of the tree appropriately.\\n19.2 Choice of Query Execution Plans\\n19.2.1 Alternatives for Query Evaluation\\nAn execution plan for a relational algebra expression represented as a query tree \\nincludes information about the access methods available for each relation as well as \\nthe algorithms to be used in computing the relational operators represented in the \\ntree. As a simple example, consider query Q1 from Chapter 7, whose corresponding relational algebra expression is\\nπFname, Lname, Address (σDname= ‘Research’ (DEPARTMENT)   Dnumber=Dno  EMPLOYEE)\\nThe query tree is shown in Figure 19.3. To convert this into an execution plan, the \\noptimizer might choose an index search for the SELECT  operation on DEPARTMENT  \\n(assuming one exists), an index-based nested-loop join algorithm that loops over \\nthe records in the result of the SELECT  operation on DEPARTMENT  for the join \\noperation (assuming an index exists on the Dno attribute of EMPLOYEE ), and a scan \\nof the JOIN  result for input to the PROJECT  operator. Additionally, the approach \\ntaken for executing the query may specify a materialized or a pipelined evaluation, although in general a pipelined evaluation is preferred whenever feasible.\\nWith materialized evaluation , the result of an operation is stored as a temporary \\nrelation (that is, the result is physically materialized ). For instance, the \\nJOIN  opera-\\ntion can be computed and the entire result stored as a temporary relation, which is then read as input by the algorithm that computes the \\nPROJECT  operation, which'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 732}, page_content='702 Chapter 19 Query Optimization\\nwould produce the query result table. On the other hand, with pipelined evaluation , \\nas the resulting tuples of an operation are produced, they are forwarded directly \\nto the next operation in the query sequence. We discussed pipelining as a strategy for query processing in Section 18.7. For example, as the selected tuples from \\nDEPARTMENT  are produced by the SELECT  operation, they are placed in a buffer; \\nthe JOIN  operation algorithm then consumes the tuples from the buffer, and those \\ntuples that result from the JOIN  operation are pipelined to the projection operation \\nalgorithm. The advantage of pipelining is the cost savings in not having to write  the intermediate results to disk and not having to read them back for the next  operation.\\nWe discussed in Section 19.1 the possibility of converting query trees into equiva-\\nlent trees so that the evaluation of the query is more efficient in terms of its execu-tion time and overall resources consumed. There are more elaborate transformations of queries that are possible to optimize, or rather to “improve.” Transformations can be applied either in a heuristic-based or cost-based manner.\\nAs we discussed in Sections 7.1.2 and 7.1.3, nested subqueries may occur in the \\nWHERE clause as well as in the FROM clause of SQL queries. In the WHERE clause, if an inner block makes a reference to the relation used in the outer block, it is called a correlated nested query. When a query is used within the FROM clause to define a resulting or derived relation, which participates as a relation in the outer query, it is equivalent to a view. Both these types of nested subqueries are handled by the optimizer, which transforms them and rewrites the entire query. In the next two subsections, we consider these two variations of query transformation and \\nrewriting with examples. We will call them nested subquery optimization and sub-query (view) merging transformation. In Section 19.8, we revisit this topic in the context of data warehouses and illustrate star transformation optimizations.\\n19.2.2 Nested Subquery Optimization\\nWe discussed nested queries in Section 7.1.2. Consider the query:\\nSELECT  E1.Fname, E1.Lname\\nFROM  EMLOYEE E1\\nWHERE  E1.Salary = ( SELECT MAX  (Salary)\\n     FROM  EMPLOYEE E2)π  Fname, Lname, Address\\nσ Dname=‘Research’\\nDEPARTMENTEMPLOYEEDnumber=Dno\\nFigure 19.3 \\nA query tree for query Q1.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 733}, page_content='19.2 Choice of Query Execution Plans  703\\nIn the above nested query, there is a query block inside an outer query block. \\nEvaluation of this query involves executing the nested query first, which yields a single value of the maximum salary M in the EMPLOYEE relation; then the outer block is simply executed with the selection condition Salary = M. The max-\\nimum salary could be obtained just from the highest value in the index on salary (if one exists) or from the catalog if it is up-to-date. The outer query is evaluated based on the same index. If no index exists, then linear search would be needed for both.\\nWe discussed correlated nested SQL queries in Section 7.1.3. In a correlated sub-\\nquery, the inner query contains a reference to the outer query via one or more vari-ables. The subquery acts as a function that returns a set of values for each value of this variable or combination of variables.\\nSuppose in the database of Figure 5.5, we modify the DEPARTMENT relation as:\\nDEPARTMENT (Dnumber, Dname, Mgr_ssn, Mgr_start_date, Zipcode)\\nConsider the query:\\nSELECT Fname, Lname, Salary\\nFROM EMPLOYEE EWHERE EXISTS ( SELECT *             FROM DEPARTMENT D             WHERE D.Dnumber = E.Dno AND D.Zipcode =30332);\\nIn the above, the nested subquery takes the E.Dno, the department where the \\nemployee works, as a parameter and returns a true or false value as a function depending on whether the department is located in zip code 30332. The naïve strat-egy for evaluating the query is to evaluate the inner nested subquery for every tuple of the outer relation, which is inefficient. Wherever possible, SQL optimizer tries to convert queries with nested subqueries into a join operation. The join can then be evaluated with one of the options we considered in Section 18.4. The above query would be converted to\\nSELECT Fname, Lname, Salary\\nFROM EMPLOYEE E, DEPARTMENT DWHERE WHERE D.Dnumber = E.Dno AND D.Zipcode =30332\\nThe process of removing the nested query and converting the outer and inner \\nquery into one block is called unnesting . Here inner join is used, since  \\nD.Dnumber is unique and the join is an equi-join; this guarantees that a tuple from relation Employee will match with at most one tuple from relation  Department. We showed in Chapter 7 that the query Q16, which has a subquery connected with the IN connector, was also unnested into a single block query involving a join. In general, queries involving a nested subquery connected by IN or ANY connector in SQL can always be converted into a single block query. Other techniques used include creation of temporary result tables from sub-queries and using them in joins.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 734}, page_content='704 Chapter 19 Query Optimization\\nWe repeat the example query shown in Section 18.1. (Note that the IN operator is \\nequivalent to the =ANY operator.):\\nQ (SJ) :\\nSELECT COUNT(*)FROM  DEPARTMENT D\\nWHERE  D.Dnumber IN ( SELECT  E.Dno\\n             FROM  EMPLOYEE E\\n             WHERE  E.Salary > 200000 )\\nIn this case again, there are two options for the optimizer:\\n  1. Evaluate the nested subquery for each outer tuple; it is inefficient to do so.\\n  2. Unnest the subquery using semi-join , which is much more efficient than \\noption 1. In Section 18.1, we used this alternative to introduce and define the semi-join operator. Note that for unnesting this subquery, which refers to expressing it as a single block, inner join cannot  be used, since in inner join \\na tuple of DEPARTMENT may match more than one tuple of EMPLOYEE and thus produce wrong results. It is easy to see that a nested subquery acts as a filter  and thus it cannot, unlike inner join, produce more rows than \\nthere are in the DEPARTMENT table. Semi-join simulates this behavior.\\nThe process we described as unnesting  is sometimes called decorrelation . We \\nshowed another example in Section 18.1 using the connector “NOT IN”, which was converted into a single block query using the operation anti-join . Optimization of \\ncomplex nested subqueries is difficult and requires techniques that can be quite involved. We illustrate two such techniques in Section 19.2.3 below. Unnesting is a powerful optimization technique and is used widely by SQL optimizers.\\n19.2.3 Subquery (View) Merging Transformation\\nThere are instances where a subquery appears in the FROM clause of a query and amounts to including a derived relation, which is similar to a predefined view that is involved in the query. This FROM clause subquery is often referred to as an inline \\nview. Sometimes, an actual view defined earlier as a separate query is used as one of \\nthe argument relations in a new query. In such cases, the transformation of the query can be referred to as a view-merging or subquery merging transformation. The techniques of view merging discussed here apply equally to both inline and predefined views,\\nConsider the following three relations:\\nEMP (Ssn, Fn, Ln, Dno)\\nDEPT (Dno, Dname, Dmgrname, Bldg_id)BLDG (Bldg_id, No_storeys, Addr, Phone)\\nThe meaning of the relations is self-explanatory; the last one represents build-\\nings where departments are located; the phone refers to a phone number for the \\nbuilding lobby.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 735}, page_content='19.2 Choice of Query Execution Plans  705\\nThe following query uses an inline view in the FROM clause; it retrieves for employ-\\nees named “John” the last name, address and phone number of building where they work:\\nSELECT  E.Ln, V.Addr, V.Phone\\nFROM  EMP E, ( SELECT  D.Dno, D.Dname, B.Addr, B.Phone\\n          FROM  DEPT D, BLDG B\\n          WHERE  D.Bldg_id = B.Bldg_id ) V\\nWHERE  V.Dno = E.Dno AND E.Fn = “John”;\\nThe above query joins the EMP table with a view called V that provides the address \\nand phone of the building where the employee works. In turn, the view joins the two tables DEPT and BLDG. This query may be executed by first temporarily materializing the view and then joining it with the EMP table. The optimizer is then constrained to consider the join order E, V or V, E; and for computing the view, the join orders possible are D, B and B, D. Thus the total number of join order candidates is limited to 4. Also, index-based join on E, V is precluded since there is no index on V on the join column Dno. The view-merging  operation \\nmerges the tables in the view with the tables from the outer query block and pro-duces the following query:\\nSELECT  E.Ln, B.Addr, B.Phone\\nFROM  EMP E, DEPT D, BLDG B\\nWHERE  D.Bldg_id = B.Bldg_id AND D.Dno = E.Dno AND E.Fn = “John”;\\nWith the merged query block above, three tables appear in the FROM clause, thus \\naffording eight possible join orders and indexes on Dno in DEPT, and Bldg_id in BLDG can be used for index-based nested loop joins that were previously excluded. We leave it to the reader to develop execution plans with and without merging to see the comparison.\\nIn general, views containing select-project-join operations are considered simple \\nviews and they can always be subjected to this type of view-merging. Typically, view merging enables additional options to be considered and results in an execution plan that is better than one without view merging. Sometimes other optimizations are enabled, such as dropping a table in the outer query if it is used within the view. View-merging may be invalid under certain conditions where the view is more complex and involves DISTINCT, OUTER JOIN, AGGREGATION, GROUP BY set operations, and so forth. We next consider a possible situation of GROUP-BY view-merging.\\nGROUP-BY View-Merging: When the view has additional constructs besides \\nselect-project-join as we mentioned above, merging of the view as shown above may or may not be desirable. Delaying the Group By operation after performing joins may afford the advantage of reducing the data subjected to grouping in case the joins have low join selectivity. Alternately, performing early Group By may be advantageous by reducing the amount of data subjected to subsequent joins. The optimizer would typically consider execution plans with and without merging and'),\n",

We illustrate \\nwith an example.\\nConsider the following relations:\\nSALES (Custid, Productid, Date, Qty_sold)\\nCUST (Custid, Custname, Country, Cemail)PRODUCT (Productid, Pname, Qty_onhand)\\nThe query: List customers from France who have bought more than 50 units \\nof a product “Ring_234” may be set up as follows:\\nA view is created to count total quantity of any item bought for the  \\n<Custid, Productid > pairs:\\nCREATE VIEW  CP_BOUGHT_VIEW AS\\nSELECT  SUM (S.Qty_sold) as Bought, S.Custid, S.Productid\\nFROM  SALES S\\nGROUP BY  S.Custid, S.Productid;\\nThen the query using this view becomes:QG: SELECT  C.Custid, C.Custname, C.Cemail\\nFROM  CUST C, PRODUCT P, CP_BOUGHT_VIEW V1\\nWHERE  P.Productid = V1.Productid AND C.Custid = V1.Custid AND V1.\\nBought >50\\nAND Pname = “Ring_234” AND C.Country = “France”;\\nThe view V1 may be evaluated first and its results temporarily materialized, then \\nthe query QG may be evaluated using the materialized view as one of the tables in the join. By using the merging transformation, this query becomes:\\nQT: SELECT  C.Custid, C.Custname, C.Cemail\\nFROM  CUST C, PRODUCT P, SALES S\\nWHERE  P.Productid = S.Productid AND C.Custid = S.Custid AND\\n          Pname = “Ring_234” AND C.Country = “France”\\nGROUP BY , P.Productid, P.rowid, C.rowid, C.Custid, C.Custname, C.Cemail\\nHAVING  SUM (S.Qty_sold) > 50;\\nAfter merging, the resulting query QT is much more efficient and cheaper to exe-\\ncute. The reasoning is as follows. Before merging, the view V1 does grouping on the entire SALES table and materializes the result, and it is expensive to do so. In the transformed query, the grouping is applied to the join of the three tables; in this \\noperation, a single product tuple is involved from the PRODUCT table, thus filter-\\ning the data from SALES considerably. The join in QT after transformation may \\nbe slightly more expensive in that the whole SALES relation is involved rather than the aggregated view table CP_BOUGHT_VIEW in QG. Note, however, that the GROUP-BY operation in V1 produces a table whose cardinality is not considerably smaller than the cardinality of SALES, because the grouping is on <Custid, Productid >, \\nwhich may not have high repetition in SALES. Also note the use of P.rowid and  C.rowid, which refer to the unique row identifiers that are added to maintain equiv-alence with the original query. We reiterate that the decision to merge GROUP-BY views must be made by the optimizer based on estimated costs.'),\n",

A view is defined in the database as a query, and a materialized view  stores the results of that query. Using materialized views to \\navoid some of the computation involved in a query is another query optimiza-tion technique. A materialized view may be stored temporarily to allow more queries to be processed against it or permanently, as is common in data ware-houses (see Chapter 29). A materialized view constitutes derived data because its content can be computed as a result of processing the defining query of the materialized view. The main idea behind materialization is that it is much cheaper to read it when needed and query against it than to recompute it from scratch. The savings can be significant when the view involves costly operations like join, aggregation, and so forth.\\nConsider, for example, view V2 in Section 7.3, which defines the view as a relation \\nby joining the DEPARTMENT and EMPLOYEE relations. For every department, it computes the total number of employees and the total salary paid to employees in that department. If this information is frequently required in reports or queries, \\nthis view may be permanently stored. The materialized view may contain data \\nrelated only to a fragment or sub-expression of the user query. Therefore, an \\ninvolved algorithm is needed to replace only the relevant fragments of the query \\nwith one or more materialized views and compute the rest of the query in a conven-tional way. We also mentioned in Section 7.3 three update (also known as refresh) strategies for updating the view:\\n ■Immediate update, which updates the view as soon as any of the relations \\nparticipating in the view are updated\\n ■Lazy update, which recomputes the view only upon demand\\n ■Periodic update (or deferred update), which updates the view later, possibly \\nwith some regular frequency\\nWhen immediate update is in force, it constitutes a large amount of overhead to keep \\nthe view updated when any of the underlying base relations have a change in the form \\nof insert, delete, and modify. For example, deleting an employee from the database, or changing the salary of an employee, or hiring a new employee affects the tuple corre-sponding to that department in the view and hence would require the view V2 in Section 7.3 to be immediately updated. These updates are handled sometimes manu-ally by programs that update all views defined on top of a base relation whenever the \\nbase relation is updated. But there is obviously no guarantee that all views may be \\naccounted for. Triggers (see Section 7.2) that are activated upon an update to the base \\nrelation may be used to take action and make appropriate changes to the materialized \\nviews. The straightforward and naive approach is to recompute the entire view for \\nevery update to any base table and is prohibitively costly. Hence incremental view \\nmaintenance is done in most RDBMSs today. We discuss that next.\\nIncremental View Maintenance. The basic idea behind incremental view mainte-\\nnance is that instead of creating the view from scratch, it can be updated incre mentally'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 738}, page_content='708 Chapter 19 Query Optimization\\nby accounting for only the changes that occurred since the last time it was  \\ncreated/updated. The trick is in figuring out exactly what is the net change to the materialized view based on a set of inserted or deleted tuples in the base relation. We describe below the general approaches to incremental view maintenance for views involving join, selection, projection, and a few types of aggregation. To deal with modification, we can consider these approaches as a combination of delete of the old tuple followed by an insert of the new tuple. Assume a view V defined over \\nrelations R and S. The respective instances are v, r, and s.\\nJoin:  If a view contains inner join of relations r and s, v\\nold = r  s, and there is a new \\nset of tuples inserted: ri, in r, then the new value of the view contains ( r ∪ ri)  s. The \\nincremental change to the view can be computed as vnew = r  s ∪ ri  s. Similarly, \\ndeleting a set of tuples rd from r results in the new view as vnew = r  s − rd  s. We \\nwill have similar expressions symmetrically when s undergoes addition or deletion.\\nSelection:  If a view is defined as V = σC R with condition C for selection, when a \\nset of tuples ri are inserted into r, the view can be modified as vnew = vold ∪ σC ri. On \\nthe other hand, upon deletion of tuples rd from r, we get vnew = vold − σC rd.\\nProjection:  Compared to the above strategy, projection requires additional work. \\nConsider the view defined as V = πSex, Salary R, where R is the EMPLOYEE relation, \\nand suppose the following <Sex, Salary > pairs exist for Salary of 50,000 in r in three \\ndistinct tuples: t 5 contains <M, 50000 >, t17 contains <M, 50000 > and t 23 contains \\n<F, 50000 >. The view v therefore contains <M, 50000 > and <F, 50000 > as two tuples \\nderived from the three tuples of r. If tuple t 5 were to be deleted from r, it would have \\nno effect on the view. However, if t 23 were to be deleted from r, the tuple <F, 50000 > \\nwould have to be removed from the view. Similarly, if another new tuple t 77 con-\\ntaining <M, 50000 > were to be inserted in the relation r, it also would have no effect \\non the view. Thus, view maintenance of projection views requires a count to be maintained in addition to the actual columns in the view. In the above example, the original count values are 2 for <M, 50000 > and 1 for <F, 50000 >. Each time an \\ninsert to the base relation results in contributing to the view, the count is incre-mented; if a deleted tuple from the base relation has been represented in the view, its count is decremented. When the count of a tuple in the view reaches zero, the tuple is actually dropped from the view. When a new inserted tuple contributes to the view, its count is set to 1. Note that the above discussion assumes that SELECT DISTINCT is being used in defining the view to correspond to the project (\\nπ) opera-\\ntion. If the multiset version of projection is used with no DISTINCT, the counts would \\nstill be used. There is an option to display the view tuple as many times as its count \\nin case the view must be displayed as a multiset.\\nIntersection:  If the view is defined as V = R ∩ S, when a new tuple ri is inserted, it \\nis compared against the s relation to see if it is present there.

The view is a result of some aggregation function applied to attribute A, which corresponds to (see Section 8.4.2):\\nGℑAggregate-function (A)\\nWe consider a few aggregate-functions below:\\n ■Count:  For keeping the count of tuples for each group, if a new tuple is \\ninserted in r, and if it has a value for G = g1, and if g1 is present in the view, \\nthen its count is incremented by 1. If there is no tuple with the value g1 in the view, then a new tuple is inserted in the view: <g1, 1>. When the tuple being \\ndeleted has the value G = g1, its count is decremented by 1. If the count of g1 \\nreaches zero after deletion in the view, that tuple is removed from the view.\\n ■Sum:  Suppose the view contains (G, sum(A)). There is a count maintained \\nfor each group in the view. If a tuple is inserted in the relation r and has (g1, x1) under the columns R.G and R.A, and if the view does not have an entry for g1, a new tuple <g1, x1 > is inserted in the view and its count is set to 1. If \\nthere is already an entry for g1 as <g1, s1 > in the old view, it is modified as \\n<g1, s1 + x1> and its count is incremented by 1. For the deletion from base \\nrelation of a tuple with R.G, R.A being <g1, x1 >, if the count of the corre-\\nsponding group g1 is 1, the tuple for group g1 would be removed from the view. If it is present and has count higher than 1, the count would be decre-mented by 1 and the sum s1 would be decremented to s1– x1.\\n ■Average:  The aggregate function cannot be maintained by itself without main-\\ntaining the sum and the count functions and then computing the average as sum divided by count. So both the sum and count functions need to be maintained and incrementally updated as discussed above to compute the new average.\\n ■Max and Min:  We can just consider Max. Min would be symmetrically han-\\ndled. Again for each group, the (g, max(a), count) combination is main-tained, where max(a) represents the maximum value of R.A in the base relation. If the inserted tuple has R.A value lower than the current max(a) value, or if it has a value equal to max(a) in the view, only the count for the group is incremented. If it has a value greater than max(a), the max value in the view is set to the new value and the count is incremented. Upon deletion of a tuple, if its R.A value is less than the max(a), only the count is decre-mented. If the R.A value matches the max(a), the count is decremented by 1; so the tuple that represented the max value of A has been deleted. Therefore, a new max must be computed for A for the group that requires substantial amount of work. If the count becomes 0, that group is removed from the view because the deleted tuple was the last tuple in the group.\\nWe discussed incremental materialization as an optimization technique for main-\\ntaining views. However, we can also look upon materialized views as a way to reduce the effort in certain queries. For example, if a query has a component, say, R \\n S or πLR that is available as a view, then the query may be modified to use the'),\n",

Sometimes an opposite situation \\nhappens. A view V is used in the query Q, and that view has been materialized as v; let us say the view includes R \\n S; however, no access structures like indexes are \\navailable on v. Suppose that indexes are available on certain attributes, say, A of the component relation R and that the query Q involves a selection condition on A. In such cases, the query against the view can benefit by using the index on a compo-nent relation, and the view is replaced by its defining query; the relation represent-ing the materialized view is not used at all.\\n19.3  Use of Selectivities  \\nin Cost-Based Optimization\\nA query optimizer does not depend solely on heuristic rules or query transforma-\\ntions; it also estimates and compares the costs of executing a query using different execution strategies and algorithms, and it then chooses the strategy with the lowest \\ncost estimate.  For this approach to work, accurate cost estimates  are required so that \\ndifferent strategies can be compared fairly and realistically. In addition, the opti-mizer must limit the number of execution strategies to be considered; otherwise, too much time will be spent making cost estimates for the many possible execution strategies. Hence, this approach is more suitable for compiled queries , rather than \\nad-hoc queries where the optimization is done at compile time and the resulting execution strategy code is stored and executed directly at runtime. For interpreted \\nqueries , where the entire process shown in Figure 18.1 occurs at runtime, a full-\\nscale optimization may slow down the response time. A more elaborate optimiza-tion is indicated for compiled queries, whereas a partial, less time-consuming optimization works best for interpreted queries.\\nThis approach is generally referred to as cost-based query optimization .\\n6 It uses \\ntraditional optimization techniques that search the solution space  to a problem for a \\nsolution that minimizes an objective (cost) function. The cost functions used in \\nquery optimization are estimates and not exact cost functions, so the optimization may select a query execution strategy that is not the optimal (absolute best) one. In Section 19.3.1, we discuss the components of query execution cost. In Sec- \\ntion 19.3.2, we discuss the type of information needed in cost functions. This infor-\\nmation is kept in the DBMS catalog. In Section 19.3.3, we describe histograms that are used to keep details on the value distributions of important attributes.\\nThe decision-making process during query optimization is nontrivial and has mul-\\ntiple challenges. We can abstract the overall cost-based query optimization approach in the following way:\\n ■For a given subexpression in the query, there may be multiple equivalence \\nrules that apply. The process of applying equivalences is a cascaded one; it \\n6This approach was first used in the optimizer for the SYSTEM R in an experimental DBMS developed at \\nIBM (Selinger et al., 1979).'),\n",

It is difficult \\nto conduct this in a space-efficient manner.\\n ■It is necessary to resort to some quantitative measure for evaluation of alter-\\nnatives. By using the space and time requirements and reducing them to some common metric called cost, it is possible to devise some methodology for optimization.\\n ■Appropriate search strategies can be designed by keeping the cheapest alter-\\nnatives and pruning the costlier alternatives.\\n ■The scope of query optimization is generally a query block. Various table \\nand index access paths, join permutations (orders), join methods, group-by methods, and so on provide the alternatives from which the query optimizer must chose.\\n ■In a global query optimization, the scope of optimization is multiple query \\nblocks.7\\n19.3.1 Cost Components for Query Execution\\nThe cost of executing a query includes the following components:\\n  1. Access cost to secondary storage.  This is the cost of transferring (reading \\nand writing) data blocks between secondary disk storage and main mem-ory buffers. This is also known as disk I/O (input/output) cost . The cost of \\nsearching for records in a disk file depends on the type of access struc-tures on that file, such as ordering, hashing, and primary or secondary indexes. In addition, factors such as whether the file blocks are allocated contiguously on the same disk cylinder or scattered on the disk affect the access cost.\\n  2. Disk storage cost.  This is the cost of storing on disk any intermediate files \\nthat are generated by an execution strategy for the query.\\n  3. Computation cost.  This is the cost of performing in-memory operations on \\nthe records within the data buffers during query execution. Such operations include searching for and sorting records, merging records for a join or a sort operation, and performing computations on field values. This is also known as CPU (central processing unit) cost .\\n  4. Memory usage cost.  This is the cost pertaining to the number of main \\nmemory buffers needed during query execution.\\n  5. Communication cost.  This is the cost of shipping the query and its results \\nfrom the database site to the site or terminal where the query originated. In distributed databases (see Chapter 23), it would also include the cost of transferring tables and results among various computers during query evaluation.\\n7We do not discuss global optimization in this sense in the present chapter. Details may be found in \\nAhmed et al. (2006).'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 742}, page_content='712 Chapter 19 Query Optimization\\nFor large databases, the main emphasis is often on minimizing the access cost to \\nsecondary storage. Simple cost functions ignore other factors and compare dif-ferent query execution strategies in terms of the number of block transfers between disk and main memory buffers. For smaller databases, where most of the data in the files involved in the query can be completely stored in memory, the emphasis is on minimizing computation cost. In distributed databases, where many sites are involved (see Chapter 23), communication cost must be minimized. It is difficult to include all the cost components in a (weighted) cost function because of the difficulty of assigning suitable weights to the cost com-ponents. This is why some cost functions consider a single factor only—disk access. In the next section, we discuss some of the information that is needed for formulating cost functions.\\n19.3.2 Catalog Information Used in Cost Functions\\nTo estimate the costs of various execution strategies, we must keep track of any information that is needed for the cost functions. This information may be stored in the DBMS catalog, where it is accessed by the query optimizer. First, we must know the size of each file. For a file whose records are all of the same type, the  number of records (tuples) ( r), the (average) record size ( R), and the number of \\nfile blocks ( b) (or close estimates of them) are needed. The blocking factor ( bfr) for \\nthe file may also be needed. These were mentioned in Section 18.3.4, and we utilized them while illustrating the various implementation algorithms for relational opera-tions. We must also keep track of the primary file organization  for each file. The \\nprimary file organization records may be unordered , ordered  by an attribute with or \\nwithout a primary or clustering index, or hashed  (static hashing or one of the \\ndynamic hashing methods) on a key attribute. Information is also kept on all pri-mary, secondary, or clustering indexes and their indexing attributes. The number \\nof levels ( x) of each multilevel index (primary, secondary, or clustering) is needed \\nfor cost functions that estimate the number of block accesses that occur during query execution. In some cost functions the number of first-level index blocks \\n(b\\nI1) is needed.\\nAnother important parameter is the number of distinct values NDV (A, R)  of an \\nattribute in relation R and the attribute selectivity ( sl), which is the fraction of \\nrecords satisfying an equality condition on the attribute. This allows estimation of \\nthe selection cardinality ( s = sl*r) of an attribute, which is the average  number of \\nrecords that will satisfy an equality selection condition on that attribute.\\nInformation such as the number of index levels is easy to maintain because it does \\nnot change very often. However, other information may change frequently; for \\nexample, the number of records r in a file changes every time a record is inserted or \\ndeleted. The query optimizer will need reasonably close but not necessarily com-\\npletely up-to-the-minute values of these parameters for use in estimating the cost of various execution strategies. To help with estimating the size of the results of que-ries, it is important to have as good an estimate of the distribution of values as pos-sible. To that end, most systems store a histogram.'),\n",

It is customary for most RDBMSs to store histograms for most of the important attributes. Without a histogram, the best assumption is that values of an attribute are uniformly distributed over its range from high to low. Histograms divide the attribute over important ranges (called buckets) and store the total number of records that belong to that bucket in that relation. Sometimes they may also store the number of distinct values in each bucket as well. An implicit assumption is made sometimes that among the distinct values within a bucket there is a uniform distribution. All these assumptions are oversimplifications that rarely hold. So keeping a histogram with a finer granularity (i.e., larger number of buckets) is always useful. A couple of variations of histo-grams are common: in equi-width  histograms, the range of values is divided into \\nequal subranges. In equi-height  histograms, the buckets are so formed that each \\none contains roughly the same number of records. Equi-height histograms are con-sidered better since they keep fewer numbers of more frequently occurring values in one bucket and more numbers of less frequently occurring ones in a different bucket. So the uniform distribution assumption within a bucket seems to hold bet-ter. We show an example of a histogram for salary information in a company in Figure 19.4. This histogram divides the salary range into five buckets that may cor-respond to the important sub-ranges over which the queries may be likely because they belong to certain types of employees. It is neither an equi-width nor an equi-height histogram.\\n30k–40k 40k–70k 70k–120k 120k–200k 200k–500k\\nSalary100200300400500600700No. of EmployeesFigure 19.4 \\nHistogram of salary in the relation EMPLOYEE.'),\n",

These cost functions are estimates that ignore computa-tion time, storage cost, and other factors. To reiterate, the following notation is used in the formulas hereafter:\\nC\\nSi: Cost for method S i in block accesses\\nrX: Number of records (tuples) in a relation X\\nbX: Number of blocks occupied by relation X (also referred to as b)\\nbfrX: Blocking factor (i.e., number of records per block) in relation X\\nslA: Selectivity of an attribute A for a given condition\\nsA: Selection cardinality of the attribute being selected ( = slA * r)\\nxA: Number of levels of the index for attribute A\\nbI1A: Number of first-level blocks of the index on attribute A\\nNDV ( A, X): Number of distinct values of attribute A in relation X\\nNote : In using the above notation in formulas, we have omitted the relation name \\nor attribute name when it is obvious.\\n ■S1—Linear search (brute force) approach.  We search all the file blocks to \\nretrieve all records satisfying the selection condition; hence, CS1a = b. For an \\nequality condition on a key attribute , only half the file blocks are searched on \\nthe average  before finding the record, so a rough estimate for CS1b = (b/2) if \\nthe record is found; if no record is found that satisfies the condition, CS1b = b.\\n ■S2—Binary search.  This search accesses approximately CS2 =  \\nlog2b + ⎡(s/bfr)⎤ − 1 file blocks. This reduces to log 2b if the equality condition \\nis on a unique (key) attribute, because s = 1 in this case.\\n ■S3a—Using a primary index to retrieve a single record.  For a primary \\nindex, retrieve one disk block at each index level, plus one disk block from the data file. Hence, the cost is one more disk block than the number of index levels: C\\nS3a = x + 1.\\n ■S3b—Using a hash key to retrieve a single record.  For hashing, only one \\ndisk block needs to be accessed in most cases. The cost function is approxi-mately C\\nS3b = 1 for static hashing or linear hashing, and it is 2 disk block \\naccesses for extendible hashing (see Section 16.8).\\n ■S4—Using an ordering index to retrieve multiple records.  If the compari-\\nson condition is >, >=, <, or <= on a key field with an ordering index, roughly \\nhalf the file records will satisfy the condition. This gives a cost function of C\\nS4 = x + (b/2). This is a very rough estimate, and although it may be correct \\non the average, it may be inaccurate in individual cases. A more accurate estimate is possible if the distribution of records is stored in a histogram.\\n ■S5—Using a clustering index to retrieve multiple records.  One disk block \\nis accessed at each index level, which gives the address of the first file disk'),\n",

Given an equality condition on the indexing attribute, s \\nrecords will satisfy the condition, where s is the selection cardinality of the \\nindexing attribute. This means that ⎡(s/bfr)⎤ file blocks will be in the cluster \\nof file blocks that hold all the selected records, giving CS5 = x + ⎡(s/bfr)⎤.\\n ■S6—Using a secondary (B+-tree) index.  For a secondary index on a key \\n(unique) attribute, with an equality (i.e., <attribute = value >) selection condi-\\ntion, the cost is x + 1 disk block accesses. For a secondary index on a nonkey \\n(nonunique) attribute, s records will satisfy an equality condition, where s is \\nthe selection cardinality of the indexing attribute. However, because the index is nonclustering, each of the records may reside on a different disk block, so the (worst case) cost estimate is C\\nS6a = x + 1 + s. The additional 1 is \\nto account for the disk block that contains the record pointers after the index is searched (see Figure 17.5). For range queries, if the comparison condition is >, >=, <, or <= and half the file records are assumed to satisfy the condition, \\nthen (very roughly) half the first-level index blocks are accessed, plus half the file records via the index. The cost estimate for this case, approximately, is C\\nS6b = x + (bI1/2) + (r/2). The r/2 factor can be refined if better selectivity \\nestimates are available through a histogram. The latter method CS6b can be \\nvery costly. For a range condition such as v1 < A < v2, the selection cardinal-\\nity s must be computed from the histogram or as a default, under the uniform \\ndistribution assumption; then the cost would be computed based on whether \\nor not A is a key or nonkey with a B+-tree index on A. (We leave this as an \\nexercise for the reader to compute under the different conditions.)\\n ■S7—Conjunctive selection.  We can use either S1 or one of the methods S2 \\nto S6 discussed above. In the latter case, we use one condition to retrieve the \\nrecords and then check in the main memory buffers whether each retrieved \\nrecord satisfies the remaining conditions in the conjunction. If multiple \\nindexes exist, the search of each index can produce a set of record pointers (record ids) in the main memory buffers. The intersection of the sets of record pointers (referred to in S9) can be computed in main memory, and then the resulting records are retrieved based on their record ids.\\n ■S8—Conjunctive selection using a composite index.  Same as S3 a, S5, or \\nS6a, depending on the type of index.\\n ■S9—Selection using a bitmap index. (See Section 17.5.2.) Depending on the \\nnature of selection, if we can reduce the selection to a set of equality condi-tions, each equating the attribute with a value (e.g., A = {7, 13, 17, 55}), then \\na bit vector for each value is accessed which is r bits or r/8 bytes long. A \\nnumber of bit vectors may fit in one block. Then, if s records qualify, s blocks \\nare accessed for the data records.\\n ■S10—Selection using a functional index.  (See Section 17.5.3.) This works \\nsimilar to S6 except that the index is based on a function of multiple attributes; \\nif that function is appearing in the SELECT clause, the corresponding index \\nmay be utilized.'),\n",

In a query optimizer, it is common to \\nenumerate the various possible strategies for executing a query and to estimate the costs for different strategies. An optimization technique, such as dynamic program-ming, may be used to find the optimal (least) cost estimate efficiently without hav-ing to consider all possible execution strategies. Dynamic programming  is an \\noptimization technique\\n8 in which subproblems are solved only once. This tech-\\nnique is applicable when a problem may be broken down into subproblems that themselves have subproblems. We will visit the dynamic programming approach when we discuss join ordering in Section 19.5.5. We do not discuss optimization algorithms here; rather, we use a simple example to illustrate how cost estimates may be used.\\n19.4.1  Example of Optimization of Selection Based  \\non Cost Formulas:\\nSuppose that the EMPLOYEE  file in Figure 5.5 has rE = 10,000 records stored in  \\nbE = 2,000 disk blocks with blocking factor bfrE = 5 records/block and the following \\naccess paths:\\n  1. A clustering index on Salary , with levels xSalary = 3 and average selection cardi-\\nnality sSalary = 20. (This corresponds to a selectivity of slSalary = 20/10000 = 0.002.)\\n  2. A secondary index on the key attribute Ssn, with xSsn = 4 (sSsn = 1, slSsn = 0.0001).\\n  3. A secondary index on the nonkey attribute Dno, with xDno = 2 and first-level \\nindex blocks bI1Dno = 4. There are NDV (Dno, EMPLOYEE)  = 125 distinct val-\\nues for Dno, so the selectivity of Dno is slDno = (1/ NDV (Dno, EMPLOYEE) ) = \\n0.008, and the selection cardinality is sDno = (rE * slDno) = (rE/NDV (Dno, \\nEMPLOYEE) ) = 80.\\n  4. A secondary index on Sex, with xSex = 1. There are NDV (Sex, EMPLOYEE)  = \\n2 values for the Sex attribute, so the average selection cardinality is sSex = \\n(rE/NDV (Sex, EMPLOYEE) ) = 5000. (Note that in this case, a histogram  \\ngiving the percentage of male and female employees may be useful, unless the percentages are approximately equal.)\\nWe illustrate the use of cost functions with the following examples:\\nOP1: σSsn=‘123456789’  (EMPLOYEE)\\nOP2: σDno>5(EMPLOYEE)\\nOP3: σDno=5(EMPLOYEE)\\nOP4: σDno=5 AND SALARY >30000  AND Sex =‘F’ (EMPLOYEE)\\nThe cost of the brute force (linear search or file scan) option S1 will be estimated as \\nCS1a = bE = 2000 (for a selection on a nonkey attribute) or CS1b = (bE/2) = 1,000 \\n8For a detailed discussion of dynamic programming as a technique of optimization, the reader may con-\\nsult an algorithm textbook such as Corman et al.

For OP1  we can use either method \\nS1 or method S6 a; the cost estimate for S6 a is CS6a = xSsn + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5, and it is \\nchosen over method S1, whose average cost is C S1b = 1,000. For OP2  we can use \\neither method S1 (with estimated cost CS1a = 2,000) or method S6 b (with estimated \\ncost CS6b = xDno + (bI1Dno/2) + (rE /2) = 2 + (4/2) + (10,000/2) = 5,004), so we choose \\nthe linear search approach for OP2 .

We need to esti-\\nmate the cost of using any one of the three components of the selection condition to retrieve the records, plus the linear search approach. The latter gives cost estimate C\\nS1a = 2000. Using the condition ( Dno = 5) first gives the cost estimate CS6a = 82. \\nUsing the condition ( Salary  > 30000) first gives a cost estimate CS4 = xSalary + (bE/2) = \\n3 + (2000/2) = 1003. Using the condition ( Sex = ‘F’) first gives a cost estimate CS6a = \\nxSex + sSex = 1 + 5000 = 5001.

Assuming uniform distribution, sZipcode  = 2,000. This would result \\nin a cost of 2,000 for bitmap indexing.\\n19.5 Cost Functions for the JOI N Operation\\nTo develop reasonably accurate cost functions for JOIN  operations, we must have an \\nestimate for the size (number of tuples) of the file that results after  the JOIN  opera-\\ntion. This is usually kept as a ratio of the size (number of tuples) of the resulting join file to the size of the \\nCARTESIAN PRODUCT  file, if both are applied to the same input \\nfiles, and it is called the join selectivity ( js). If we denote the number of tuples of a \\nrelation R by |R|, we have:\\n js = | (R c S)| / |(R × S)| = |(R c S)| / (| R| * |S|)\\nIf there is no join condition c, then js = 1 and the join is the same as the CARTESIAN \\nPRODUCT . If no tuples from the relations satisfy the join condition, then js = 0. In \\ngeneral, 0 ≤ js ≤ 1. For a join where the condition c is an equality comparison  \\nR.A = S.B, we get the following two special cases:\\n  1. If A is a key of R, then |( R c S)| ≤ | S|, so js ≤ (1/| R|). This is because each \\nrecord in file S will be joined with at most one record in file R, since A is a \\nkey of R. A special case of this condition is when attribute B is a foreign key  \\nof S that references the primary key A  of R. In addition, if the foreign key B'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 748}, page_content='718 Chapter 19 Query Optimization\\nhas the NOT NULL constraint, then js = (1/|R|), and the result file of the join \\nwill contain | S| records.\\n  2. If B is a key of S, then |( R c S)| ≤ | R|, so js ≤ (1/| S|).\\nHence a simple formula  to use for join selectivity is:\\njs = 1/ max (NDV (A, R), NDV (B,S) )\\nHaving an estimate of the join selectivity for commonly occurring join conditions \\nenables the query optimizer to estimate the size of the resulting file after the join operation, which we call join cardinality  (jc).\\njc = |(R\\nc S)| = js * |R| * |S|.\\nWe can now give some sample approximate  cost functions for estimating the cost of \\nsome of the join algorithms given in Section 18.4. The join operations are of the form:\\nR  A=B S\\nwhere A and B are domain-compatible attributes of R and S, respectively. Assume \\nthat R has bR blocks and that S has bS blocks:\\n ■J1—Nested-loop join.  Suppose that we use R for the outer loop; then we get \\nthe following cost function to estimate the number of block accesses for this \\nmethod, assuming three memory buffers.  We assume that the blocking factor \\nfor the resulting file is bfrRS and that the join selectivity is known:\\nCJ1 = bR + (bR * bS) + ((js * |R| * |S|)/bfrRS)\\nThe last part of the formula is the cost of writing the resulting file to disk. This \\ncost formula can be modified to take into account different numbers of memory buffers, as presented in Section 19.4. If n\\nB main memory buffer \\nblocks are available to perform the join, the cost formula becomes:\\nCJ1 = bR + ( ⎡bR/(nB – 2)⎤ * bS) + ((js * |R| * |S|)/bfrRS)\\n ■J2—Index-based nested-loop join (using an access structure to retrieve \\nthe matching record(s)).

Esti-\\nmating the cost of every possible join tree for a query with a large number of joins will require a substantial amount of time by the query optimizer. Hence, some pruning of the possible query trees is needed. Query optimizers typically limit the structure of a (join) query tree to that of left-deep (or right-deep) trees. A left-deep \\njoin tree  is a binary tree in which the right child of each non–leaf node is always a \\nbase relation. The optimizer would choose the particular left-deep join tree with the lowest estimated cost. Two examples of left-deep trees are shown in Figure 19.5(a). (Note that the trees in Figure 19.2 are also left-deep trees.) A right-deep join tree  is \\na binary tree where the left child of every leaf node is a base relation (Figure 19.5(b)).\\nA bushy join tree  is a binary tree where the left or right child of an internal node \\nmay be an internal node. Figure 19.5(b) shows a right-deep join tree whereas Fig-ure 19.5(c) shows a bushy one using four base relations. Most query optimizers con-sider left-deep join trees as the preferred join tree and then choose one among the \\nn! possible join orderings, where n is the number of relations. We discuss the join \\nordering issue in more detail in Sections 19.5.4 and 19.5.5. The left-deep tree has exactly one shape, and the join orders for N tables in a left-deep tree are given by N!. \\nIn contrast, the shapes of a bushy tree are given by the following recurrence relation (i.e., recursive function), with S(n) defined as follows: S(1) = 1.\\nS(n) = \\nn-1\\nΣ\\ni =1 S(i) * S(n − i)\\nThe above recursive equation for S(n) can be explained as follows. It states that, for \\ni between 1 and N – 1 as the number of leaves in the left subtree, those leaves may \\nbe rearranged in S(i) ways. Similarly, the remaining N – i leaves in the right subtree \\ncan be rearranged in S(N – i) ways.

One advantage of left-deep (or right-deep) trees is that they are amenable to pipelining, as discussed in Section 18.7. For instance, consider the first left-deep tree in Figure 19.5(a) and assume that the join algorithm is the index-based nested-loop method; in this case, a disk page of tuples of the outer relation is used to probe the inner relation for matching tuples. As resulting tuples (records) are pro-duced from the join of R1 and R2, they can be used to probe R3 to locate their match-ing records for joining. Likewise, as resulting tuples are produced from this join, they could be used to probe R4. Another advantage of left-deep (or right-deep) trees \\nis that having a base relation as one of the inputs of each join allows the optimizer to \\nutilize any access paths on that relation that may be useful in executing the join.\\nIf materialization is used instead of pipelining (see Sections 18.7 and 19.2), the join \\nresults could be materialized and stored as temporary relations.

This is referred to as physical optimization . \\nIf this optimization is based on the relative cost of each possible implementation, we call it cost-based physical optimization. The two sets of approaches to this deci-sion making may be broadly classified as top-down and bottom-up approaches. In the top-down  approach, we consider the options for implementing each operation \\nworking our way down the tree and choosing the best alternative at each stage. In the bottom-up  approach, we consider the operations working up the tree, evaluat-\\ning options for physical execution, and choosing the best at each stage. Theoreti-cally, both approaches amount to evaluation of the entire space of possible implementation solutions to minimize the cost of evaluation; however, the bottom-up strategy lends itself naturally to pipelining and hence is used in commercial RDBMSs. Among the most important physical decisions is the ordering of join operations, which we will briefly discuss in Section 19.5.5. There are certain heuris-tics applied at the physical optimization stage that make elaborate cost computa-tions unnecessary. These heuristics include:\\n ■For selections, use index scans wherever possible.\\n ■If the selection condition is conjunctive, use the selection that results in the \\nsmallest cardinality first.\\n ■If the relations are already sorted on the attributes being matched in a join, \\nthen prefer sort-merge join to other join methods.\\n ■For union and intersection of more than two relations, use the associative \\nrule; consider the relations in the ascending order of their estimated car-dinalities.\\n ■If one of the arguments in a join has an index on the join attribute, use that \\nas the inner relation.\\n ■If the left relation is small and the right relation is large and it has index on \\nthe joining column, then try index-based nested-loop join.\\n ■Consider only those join orders where there are no Cartesian products or \\nwhere all joins appear before Cartesian products.\\nThe following are only some of the types of physical level heuristics used by the \\noptimizer. If the number of relations is small (typically less than 6) and, there-\\nfore, possible implementations options are limited, then most optimizers would \\nelect to apply a cost-based optimization approach directly rather than to explore \\nheuristics.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 755}, page_content='19.5 Cost Functions for the JOIN Operation  725\\n19.5.5 Dynamic Programming Approach to Join Ordering\\nWe saw in Section 19.5.3 that there are many possible ways to order n relations in \\nan n-way join. Even for n = 5, which is not uncommon in practical applications, the \\npossible permutations are 120 with left-deep trees and 1,680 with bushy trees. Since bushy trees expand the solution space tremendously, left-deep trees are generally preferred (over both bushy and right-deep trees). They have multiple advantages: First, they work well with the common algorithms for join, including nested-loop, index-based nested-loop, and other one-pass algorithms. Second, they can generate fully pipelined plans  (i.e., plans where all joins can be evaluated using pipelining). \\nNote that inner tables must always be materialized because in the join implementa-tion algorithms, the entire inner table is needed to perform the matching on the join attribute. This is not possible with right-deep trees.\\nThe common approach to evaluate possible permutations of joining relations is a greedy \\nheuristic approach called dynamic programming. Dynamic programming  is an opti-\\nmization technique\\n13 where subproblems are solved only once, and it is applicable when \\na problem may be broken down into subproblems that themselves have subproblems. A typical dynamic programming algorithm has the following characteristics\\n14:\\n  1. The structure of an optimal solution is developed.\\n  2. The value of the optimal solution is recursively defined.\\n  3. The optimal solution is computed and its value developed in a bottom-up fashion.\\nNote that the solution developed by this procedure is an optimal solution and not the \\nabsolute optimal solution. To consider how dynamic programming may be applied to the join order selection, consider the problem of ordering a 5-way join of relations r1, \\nr2, r3, r4, r5. This problem has 120 ( =5!) possible left-deep tree solutions. Ideally, the \\ncost of each of them can be estimated and compared and the best one selected. Dynamic programming takes an approach that breaks down this problem to make it more man-ageable. We know that for three relations, there are only six possible left-deep tree solutions. Note that if all possible bushy tree join solutions were to be evaluated, there would be 12 of them. We can therefore consider the join to be broken down as:\\nr1 \\n r2  r3  r4  r5 = (r1  r2  r3)  r4  r5\\nThe 6 ( = 3!) possible options of ( r1  r2  r3) may then be combined with the 6 pos-\\nsible options of taking the result of the first join, say, temp1, and then considering the next join:\\n(temp1 \\n r4  r5)\\nIf we were to consider the 6 options for evaluating temp1 and, for each of them, \\nconsider the 6 options of evaluating the second join (temp1  r4  r5), the possible \\n13For a detailed discussion of dynamic programming as a technique of optimization, the reader may con-\\nsult an algorithm textbook such as Corman et al.

This is where dynamic programming can \\nbe used to do a sort of greedy optimization. It takes the “optimal” plan for evaluating temp1 and does not revisit that plan. So the solution space now reduces to only 6 \\noptions to be considered for the second join. Thus the total number of options con-\\nsidered becomes 6 + 6 instead of 120 ( =5!) in the nonheuristic exhaustive approach.\\nThe order in which the result of the join is generated is also important for finding \\nthe best overall order of joins since for using sort-merge join with the next relation, it plays an important role. The ordering beneficial for the next join is considered an interesting  join  order . This approach was first proposed in System R at IBM \\nResearch.\\n15 Besides the join attributes of the later join, System R also included \\ngrouping attributes of a later GROUP BY or a sort order at the root of the tree \\namong interesting sort orders. For example, in the case we discussed above, the \\ninteresting join orders for the temp1 relation will include those that match the join attribute(s) required to join with either r4 or with r5. The dynamic programming \\nalgorithm can be extended to consider best join orders for each interesting sort order. The number of subsets of n relations is 2\\nn (for n = 5 it is 32; n = 10 gives \\n1,024, which is still manageable), and the number of interesting join orders is small. The complexity of the extended dynamic programming algorithm to determine the optimal left-deep join tree permutation has been shown to be O(3\\nn).\\n19.6  Example to Illustrate Cost-Based  \\nQuery Optimization\\nWe will consider query Q2 and its query tree shown in Figure 19.1(a) to illustrate \\ncost-based query optimization:\\nQ2: SELECT  Pnumber, Dnum, Lname, Address, Bdate\\n FROM  PROJECT, DEPARTMENT, EMPLOYEE\\n WHERE  Dnum=Dnumber AND  Mgr_ssn=Ssn AND\\n  Plocation =‘Stafford’;\\nSuppose we have the information about the relations shown in Figure 19.6.

This is computed from the tables in Figure 19.6 by multiplying \\nSelectivity  * Num_rows , where Selectivity  is estimated by 1/ Num_distinct . So the cost of \\nusing the index and accessing the records is estimated to be 12 block accesses (2 for the index and 10 for the data blocks). The cost of a table scan is estimated to be 100 block accesses, so the index access is more efficient as expected.\\nIn the materialized approach, a temporary file \\nTEMP1  of size 1 block is created to \\nhold the result of the selection operation. The file size is calculated by determin-ing the blocking factor using the formula \\nNum_rows /Blocks , which gives 2,000/100 \\nor 20 rows per block. Hence, the 10 records selected from the PROJECT  relation \\nwill fit into a single block. Now we can compute the estimated cost of the first join. We will consider only the nested-loop join method, where the outer relation is the temporary file, \\nTEMP1 , and the inner relation is DEPARTMENT . Since the \\nentire TEMP1  file fits in the available buffer space, we need to read each of the \\nDEPARTMENT  table’s five blocks only once, so the join cost is six block accesses \\nplus the cost of writing the temporary result file, TEMP2 . The optimizer would \\nhave to determine the size of TEMP2 . Since the join attribute Dnumber  is the key \\nfor DEPARTMENT , any Dnum  value from TEMP1  will join with at most one record \\nfrom DEPARTMENT , so the number of rows in TEMP2  will be equal to the number \\nof rows in TEMP1 , which is 10. The optimizer would determine the record size for \\nTEMP2  and the number of blocks needed to store these 10 rows. For brevity, \\nassume that the blocking factor for TEMP2  is five rows per block, so a total of two \\nblocks are needed to store TEMP2 .\\nFinally, the cost of the last join must be estimated. We can use a single-loop join on \\nTEMP2  since in this case the index EMP_SSN  (see Figure 19.6) can be used to probe \\nand locate matching records from EMPLOYEE . Hence, the join method would \\ninvolve reading in each block of TEMP2  and looking up each of the five Mgr_ssn  \\nvalues using the EMP_SSN  index. Each index lookup would require a root access, a \\nleaf access, and a data block access ( x + 1, where the number of levels x is 2). So, 10 \\nlookups require 30 block accesses. Adding the two block accesses for TEMP2  gives a \\ntotal of 32 block accesses for this join.\\nFor the final projection, assume pipelining is used to produce the final result, which \\ndoes not require additional block accesses, so the total cost for join order (1) is esti-\\nmated as the sum of the previous costs. The optimizer would then estimate costs in a similar manner for the other three join orders and choose the one with the lowest estimate.

Here \\nwe consider the size estimation of some other operations.\\nProjection: For projection of the form \\nπList (R) expressed as SELECT <attribute-\\nlist> FROM R, since SQL treats it as a multiset, the estimated number of tuples in \\nthe result is |R|. If the DISTINCT option is used, then size of πA (R) is NDV (A, R).\\n16We have just illustrated this facility without describing the syntactic details of each system.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 760}, page_content='730 Chapter 19 Query Optimization\\nSet Operations: If the arguments for an intersection, union, or set difference are \\nmade of selections on the same relation, they can be rewritten as conjunction, dis-junction, or negation, respectively. For example, \\nσc1 (R) ∩ σc2 (R) can be rewritten \\nas σc1 AND c2 (R); and σc1 (R) ∪ σc2 (R) can be rewritten as σc1 OR c2 (R). The size \\nestimation can be made based on the selectivity of conditions c1 and c2. Otherwise, the estimated upper bound on the size of r ∩ s is the minimum of the sizes of r and s; \\nthe estimated upper bound on the size of r \\n∪ s is the sum of their sizes.\\nAggregation: The size of GℑAggregate-function (A) R is NDV (G, R) since there is one \\ngroup for each unique value of G.\\nOuter Join  : the size of R LEFT OUTER JOIN S would be |R  S| plus |R anti-join S|. \\nSimilarly, the size of R FULL OUTER JOIN S would be |r  s| plus |r anti-join s| plus \\n|s anti-join r|. We discussed anti-join selectivity estimation in Section 19.5.1.\\n19.7.3 Plan Caching\\nIn Chapter 2, we referred to parametric users who run the same queries or transac-tions repeatedly, but each time with a different set of parameters. For example, a bank teller uses an account number and some function code to check the balance in that account. To run such queries or transactions repeatedly, the query optimizer computes the best plan when the query is submitted for the first time and caches the plan for future use. This storing of the plan and reusing it is referred to as plan \\ncaching . When the query is resubmitted with different constants as parameters, the \\nsame plan is reused with the new parameters. It is conceivable that the plan may need to be modified under certain situations; for example, if the query involves report generation over a range of dates or range of accounts, then, depending on \\nthe amount of data involved, different strategies may apply. Under a variation \\ncalled parametric query optimization , a query is optimized without a certain set of \\nvalues for its parameters and the optimizer outputs a number of plans for different \\npossible value sets, all of which are cached. As a query is submitted, the parameters are compared to the ones used for the various plans and the cheapest among the applicable plans is used.\\n19.7.4 Top- k Results Optimization\\nWhen the output of a query is expected to be large, sometimes the user is satisfied \\nwith only the top- k results based on some sort order. Some RDBMSs have a limit  K \\nclause  to limit the result to that size. Similarly, hints may be specified to inform the \\noptimizer to limit the generation of the result. Trying to generate the entire result and then presenting only the top- k results by sorting is a naive and inefficient strat-\\negy. Among the suggested strategies, one uses generation of results in a sorted order so that it can be stopped after K tuples. Other strategies, such as introducing addi-\\ntional selection conditions based on the estimated highest value, have been pro-posed. Details are beyond our scope here. The reader may consult the bibliographic notes for details.'),\n",

In Section 19.2, we saw examples of query transformation and rewriting. Those examples dealt with nested subqueries and used heuristics rather than cost-based optimization. The subquery (view) merging example we showed can be considered a heuristic transformation; but the group-by view merging uses cost-based optimization as well. In this section, we consider a transformation of star-schema queries in data warehouses based on cost considerations. These queries are commonly used in data warehouse applications that follow the star schema. (See Section 29.3 for a discussion of star schemas.)\\nWe will refer to this procedure as s tar-transformation optimization . The star \\nschema contains a collection of tables; it gets its name because of the schema’s resemblance to a star-like shape whose center contains one or more fact tables (relations) that reference multiple dimension tables (relations). The fact table con-tains information about the relationships (e.g., sales) among the various dimension tables (e.g., customer, part, supplier, channel, year, etc.) and measure columns (e.g., amount_sold, etc.). Consider the representative query called QSTAR given below. Assume that D1, D2, D3 are aliases for the dimension tables DIM1, DIM2, DIM3, whose primary keys are, respectively, D1.Pk, D2.Pk, and D3.Pk . These dimensions \\nhave corresponding foreign key attributes in the fact table FACT with alias F—namely, F.Fk1, F.Fk2, F.Fk3—on which joins can be defined. The query creates a grouping on attributes D1.X, D2.Y and produces a sum of the so-called “measure” attribute (see Section 29.3) F.M from the fact table F. There are conditions on attri-butes A, B, C in DIM1, DIM2, DIM3, respectively:\\nQuery QSTAR:\\nSELECT  D1.X, D2.Y, SUM (F.M)\\nFROM  FACT F, DIM1 D1, DIM2 D2, DIM3 D3\\nWHERE  F.Fk1 = D1.Pk and F.Fk2 = D2.Pk and F.Fk3 = D3.Pk and\\n          D1.A > 5 and D2.B < 77 and D3.C = 11\\nGROUP BY  D1.X, D2.Y\\nThe fact table is generally very large in comparison with the dimension tables. \\nQSTAR is a typical star query, and its fact table tends to be generally very large and joined with several tables of small dimension tables. The query may also contain single-table filter predicates on other columns of the dimension tables, which are generally restrictive. The combination of these filters helps to significantly reduce the data set processed from the fact table (such as D1.A > 5 in the above query). \\nThis type of query generally does grouping on columns coming from dimension \\ntables and aggregation on measure columns coming from the fact table.\\nThe goal of star-transformation optimization is to access only this reduced set of \\ndata from the fact table and avoid using a full table scan on it. Two types of star-\\ntransformation optimizations are possible: (A) classic star transformation, and'),\n",

Both these optimizations are performed on \\nthe basis of comparative costs of the original and the transformed queries.\\n A. Classic Star Transformation\\n  In this optimization, a Cartesian product of the dimension tables is per-\\nformed first after applying the filters (such as D1.A > 5 ) to each dimension table. Note that generally there are no join predicates between dimension tables. The result of this Cartesian product is then joined with the fact table using B-tree indexes (if any) on the joining keys of the fact table.\\n B. Bitmap Index Star Transformation\\n  The requirement with this optimization is that there must be bitmap\\n17 \\nindexes on the fact-table joining keys referenced in the query. For example, \\nin QSTAR, there must be bitmap indexes (see Section 17.5.2) on FACT.Fk1, FACT.Fk2, and FACT.Fk3 attributes; each bit in the bitmap corresponds to a row in the fact table. The bit is set if the key value of the attribute appears in a row of the fact table. The given query QSTAR is transformed into Q2STAR as shown below.\\nQ2STAR:SELECT  D1.X, D2.Y, SUM (F.M)\\nFROM  FACT F, DIM1 D1, DIM2 D2\\nWHERE  F.Fk1 = D1.Pk and F.Fk2 = D2.Pk and D1.A > 5 and D2.B < 77 and\\n F.Fk1 IN (SELECT  D1.Pk\\n  FROM  DIM1 D1\\n  WHERE  D1.A > 5) AND\\n F.Fk2 IN (SELECT  D2.Pk\\n  FROM  DIM2 D2\\n  WHERE  D2.B < 77) AND\\n F.Fk3 IN (SELECT  D3.pk\\n  FROM  DIM3 D3\\n  WHERE  D3.C = 11)\\nGROUP BY  D1.X, D2.Y ;\\n  The bitmap star transformation adds subquery predicates corresponding to \\nthe dimension tables. Note that the subqueries introduced in Q2STAR may be looked upon as a set membership operation; for example, F.Fk1 IN (5, 9, 12, 13, 29 …).\\nWhen driven by bitmap AND and OR operations of the key values supplied by the \\ndimension subqueries, only the relevant rows from the fact table need to be retrieved. If the filter predicates on the dimension tables and the intersection of the fact table joining each dimension table filtered out a significant subset of the fact table rows, then this optimization would prove to be much more efficient than a brute force full-table scan of the fact table.\\n17In some cases, the B-tree index keys can be converted into bitmaps, but we will not discuss this  \\ntechnique here.'),\n",

For a subquery, the bitmaps retrieved for various key values are merged (OR-ed).\\n  3.

The join back of a dimension table can be avoided if the column(s) \\nselected from the subquery are unique and the columns of the dimension table are \\nnot referenced in the SELECT and GROUP-BY clauses. Note that in Q2STAR, the table DIM3 is not joined back to the FACT table, since it is not referenced in the SELECT and GROUP-BY clauses, and DIM3.Pk is unique.\\n19.9 Overview of Query Optimization in Oracle18\\nThis section provides a broad overview of various features in Oracle query process-ing, including query optimization, execution, and analytics.\\n19\\n19.9.1 Physical Optimizer\\nThe Oracle physical optimizer is cost based and was introduced in Oracle 7.1. The scope of the physical optimizer is a single query block. The physical optimizer \\nexamines alternative table and index access paths, operator algorithms, join order-ings, join methods, parallel execution distribution methods, and so on. It chooses the execution plan with the lowest estimated cost. The estimated query cost is a \\nrelative number proportional to the expected elapsed time needed to execute the query with the given execution plan.\\nThe physical optimizer calculates this cost based on object statistics (such as table \\ncardinalities, number of distinct values in a column, column high and low values, data distribution of column values), the estimated usage of resources (such as I/O and CPU time), and memory needed. Its estimated cost is an internal metric that \\n18This section is contributed by Rafi Ahmed of Oracle Corporation.\\n19Support for analytics was introduced in Oracle 10.2.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 764}, page_content='734 Chapter 19 Query Optimization\\nroughly corresponds to the run time and the required resources. The goal of cost-\\nbased optimization in Oracle is to find the best trade-off between the lowest run time and the least resource utilization.\\n19.9.2 Global Query Optimizer\\nIn traditional RDBMSs, query optimization consists of two distinct logical and physical optimization phases. In contrast, Oracle has a global query optimizer, where logical transformation and physical optimization phases have been inte-grated to generate an optimal execution plan for the entire query tree. The architec-ture of the Oracle query processing is illustrated in Figure 19.7.\\nOracle performs a multitude of query transformations, which change and trans-\\nform the user queries into equivalent but potentially more optimal forms. Transfor-mations can be either heuristic-based or cost-based. The cost-based query transformation (CBQT) framework\\n20 introduced in Oracle 10g provides efficient \\nmechanisms for exploring the state space generated by applying one or more trans-formations. During cost-based transformation, an SQL statement, which may com-prise multiple query blocks, is copied and transformed and its cost is computed using the physical optimizer. This process is repeated multiple times, each time applying a new set of possibly interdependent transformations; and, at the end, one \\nor more transformations are selected and applied to the original SQL statement, if \\nthose transformations result in an optimal execution plan. To deal with the combi-\\nnatorial explosion, the CBQT framework provides efficient strategies for searching \\nthe state space of various transformations.\\nThe availability of the general framework for cost-based transformation has made it \\npossible for other innovative transformations to be added to the vast repertoire of \\n20As presented in Ahmed et al. (2006).Parser\\nFront-End\\nExecutionPhysical\\nOptimizationCost-Based\\nTransformation\\nCBQT\\nFrameworkHeuristic-Based\\nTransformation\\nFigure 19.7 \\nCost-based query  transformation  \\nframework (based on \\nAhmed et al., 2006).'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 765}, page_content='19.9 Overview of Query Optimization in Oracle  735\\nOracle’s query transformation techniques. Major among these transformations are \\ngroup-by and distinct subquery merging (in the FROM clause of the query), sub-query unnesting, predicate move-around, common subexpression elimination, join predicate push down, OR expansion, subquery coalescing, join factorization,  subquery removal through window function, star transformation, group-by placement, and bushy join trees.\\n21\\nThe cost-based transformation framework of Oracle 10g is a good example of the sophisticated approach taken to optimize SQL queries.\\n19.9.3 Adaptive Optimization\\nOracle’s physical optimizer is adaptive and uses a feedback loop from the execu-tion level to improve on its previous decisions. The optimizer selects the most optimal execution plan for a given SQL statement using the cost model, which relies on object statistics (e.g., number of rows, distribution of column values, etc.) and system statistics (e.g., I/O bandwidth of the storage subsystem). The optimality of the final execution plan depends primarily on the accuracy of the statistics fed into the cost model as well as on the sophistication of the cost model itself. In Oracle, the feedback loop shown in Figure 19.7 establishes a bridge between the execution engine and the physical optimizer. The bridge brings valuable statistical information to enable the physical optimizer to assess the impact of its decisions and make better decisions for the current and future exe-cutions. For example, based on the estimated value of table cardinality, the opti-mizer may choose the index-based nested-loop join method. However, during the execution phase, the actual table cardinality may be detected to diverge sig-nificantly from the estimated value. This information may trigger the physical optimizer to revise its decision and dynamically change the index access join method to the hash join method.\\n19.9.4 Array Processing\\nOne of the critical deficiencies of SQL implementations is its lack of support for N-dimensional array-based computation. Oracle has made extensions for analyt-\\nics and OLAP features; these extensions have been integrated into the Oracle RDBMS engine.\\n22 We will illustrate the need for OLAP queries when we discuss \\ndata warehousing in Chapter 29. These SQL extensions involving array-based \\ncomputations for complex modeling and optimizations include access structures \\nand execution strategies for processing these computations efficiently. The com-\\nputation clause (details are beyond our scope here) allows the Oracle RDBMS to \\ntreat a table as a multidimensional array and specify a set of formulas over it. The \\nformulas replace multiple joins and UNION operations that must be performed for equivalent computation with current ANSI SQL (where ANSI stands for \\n21More details can be found in Ahmed et al. (2006, 2014).\\n22See Witkowski et al. (2003) for more details.'),\n",

The computation clause not only allows \\nfor ease of application development but also offers the Oracle RDBMS an opportu-nity to perform better optimization.\\n19.9.5 Hints\\nAn interesting addition to the Oracle query optimizer is the capability for an applica-tion developer to specify hints (also called query annotations  or directives  in other \\nsystems) to the optimizer. Hints are embedded in the text of an SQL statement. Hints are commonly used to address the infrequent cases where the optimizer chooses a suboptimal plan. The idea is that an application developer occasionally might need to override the optimizer decisions based on cost or cardinality mis-estimations. For example, consider the \\nEMPLOYEE  table shown in Figure 5.6. The Sex column of that \\ntable has only two distinct values. If there are 10,000 employees, then the optimizer, in the absence of a histogram on the \\nSex column, would estimate that half are male \\nand half are female, assuming a uniform data distribution. If a secondary index exists, it would more than likely not be used. However, if the application developer knows that there are only 100 male employees, a hint could be specified in an SQL query whose \\nWHERE -clause condition is Sex = ‘M’ so that the associated index would \\nbe used in processing the query. Various types of hints can be specified for different \\noperations; these hints include but are not limited to the following:\\n ■The access path for a given table\\n ■The join order for a query block\\n ■A particular join method for a join between tables\\n ■The enabling or disabling of a transformation\\n19.9.6 Outlines\\nIn Oracle RDBMSs, outlines are used to preserve execution plans of SQL state-\\nments or queries. Outlines are implemented and expressed as a collection of hints, because hints are easily portable and comprehensible. Oracle provides an extensive set of hints that are powerful enough to specify any execution plan, no matter how complex. When an outline is used during the optimization of an SQL statement, these hints are applied at appropriate stages by the optimizer (and other components). Every SQL statement processed by the Oracle optimizer automatically generates an outline that can be displayed with the execution plan. Outlines are used for purposes such as plan stability, what-if analysis, and perfor-mance experiments.\\n19.9.7 SQL Plan Management\\nExecution plans for SQL statements have a significant impact on the overall perfor-mance of a database system. New optimizer statistics, configuration parameter \\nchanges, software updates, introduction of new query optimization and processing \\ntechniques, and hardware resource utilizations are among a multitude of factors'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 767}, page_content='19.10 Semantic Query Optimization  737\\nthat may cause the Oracle query optimizer to generate a new execution plan for the \\nsame SQL queries or statements. Although most of the changes in the execution plans are beneficial or benign, a few execution plans may turn out to be suboptimal, which can have a negative impact on system performance.\\nIn Oracle 11g, a novel feature called SQL plan management (SPM) was introduced\\n23 \\nfor managing execution plans for a set of queries or workloads. SPM provides stable \\nand optimal performance for a set of SQL statements by preventing new subopti-mal plans from being executed while allowing other new plans to be executed if they are verifiably better than the previous plans. SPM encapsulates an elaborate mechanism for managing the execution plans of a set of SQL statements, for which the user has enabled SPM. SPM maintains the previous execution plans in the form of stored outlines associated with texts of SQL statements and compares the perfor-mances of the old and new execution plans for a given SQL statement before per-mitting them to be used by the user. SPM can be configured to work automatically, or it can be manually controlled for one or more SQL statements.\\n19.10 Semantic Query Optimization\\nA different approach to query optimization, called semantic query optimization , \\nhas been suggested. This technique, which may be used in combination with the \\ntechniques discussed previously, uses constraints specified on the database schema—\\nsuch as unique attributes and other more complex constraints—to modify one query into another query that is more efficient to execute. We will not discuss this approach in detail but we will illustrate it with a simple example. Consider the SQL query:\\nSELECT  E.Lname, M.Lname\\nFROM  EMPLOYEE AS E, EMPLOYEE AS M\\nWHERE  E.Super_ssn=M.Ssn AND  E.Salary > M.Salary\\nThis query retrieves the names of employees who earn more than their supervisors. \\nSuppose that we had a constraint on the database schema that stated that no employee can earn more than his or her direct supervisor. If the semantic query optimizer checks for the existence of this constraint, it does not need to execute the query because it knows that the result of the query will be empty. This may save considerable time if the constraint checking can be done efficiently. However, searching through many constraints to find those that are applicable to a given query and that may semantically optimize it can also be time-consuming.\\nConsider another example:\\nSELECT Lname, Salary\\nFROM EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENTWHERE EMPLOYEE.Dno = DEPARTMENT.Dnumber and  \\nEMPLOYEE.Salary >100000\\n23See Ziauddin et al. (2008).'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 768}, page_content='738 Chapter 19 Query Optimization\\nIn this example, the attributes retrieved are only from one relation: EMPLOYEE; the \\nselection condition is also on that one relation. However, there is a referential integ-rity constraint that Employee.Dno is a foreign key that refers to the primary key Department.Dnumber. Therefore, this query can be transformed by removing the DEPARTMENT relation from the query and thus avoiding the inner join as follows:\\nSELECT Lname, Salary\\nFROM EMPLOYEE\\nWHERE EMPLOYEE.Dno IS NOT NULL and EMPLOYEE.Salary >100000\\nThis type of transformation is based on the primary-key/foreign-key relationship \\nsemantics, which are a constraint between the two relations.\\nWith the inclusion of active rules and additional metadata in database systems (see \\nChapter 26), semantic query optimization techniques are being gradually incorpo-\\nrated into DBMSs.\\n19.11 Summary\\n In the previous chapter, we presented the strategies for query processing used by relational DBMSs. We considered algorithms for various standard relational opera-tors, including selection, projection, and join. We also discussed other types of joins, including outer join, semi-join, and anti-join, and we discussed aggregation as well as external sorting. In this chapter, our goal was to focus on query optimiza-tion techniques used by relational DBMSs. In Section 19.1 we introduced the nota-tion for query trees and graphs and described heuristic approaches to query optimization; these approaches use heuristic rules and algebraic techniques to improve the efficiency of query execution. We showed how a query tree that repre-sents a relational algebra expression can be heuristically optimized by reorganizing the tree nodes and transforming the tree into another equivalent query tree that is more efficient to execute. We also gave equivalence-preserving transformation rules and a systematic procedure for applying them to a query tree. In Section 19.2 \\nwe described alternative query evaluation plans, including pipelining and material-\\nized evaluation. Then we introduced the notion of query transformation of SQL \\nqueries; this transformation optimizes nested subqueries. We also illustrated with examples of merging subqueries occurring in the FROM clause, which act as derived relations or views. We also discussed the technique of materializing views.\\nWe discussed in some detail the cost-based approach to query optimization in \\nSection 19.3. We discussed information maintained in catalogs that the query optimizer consults. We also discussed histograms to maintain distribution of important attributes. We showed how cost functions are developed for some database access algorithms for selection and join in Sections 19.4 and 19.5, respec-tively. We illustrated with an example in Section 19.6 how these cost functions are used to estimate the costs of different execution strategies. A number of addi-tional issues such as display of query plans, size estimation of results, plan cach-ing and top-k results optimization were discussed in Section 19.7. Section 19.8'),\n",

Examples of such systems include airline reservations, banking, credit card processing, online retail purchas-ing, stock markets, supermarket checkouts, and many other applications. These systems require high availability and fast response time for hundreds of concur-rent users. In this chapter, we present the concepts that are needed in transaction processing systems. We define the concept of a transaction, which is used to repre-sent a logical unit of database processing that must be completed in its entirety to ensure correctness. A transaction is typically implemented by a computer program that includes database commands such as retrievals, insertions, deletions, and updates. We introduced some of the basic techniques for database programming in Chapters 10 and 11.\\nIn this chapter, we focus on the basic concepts and theory that are needed to ensure \\nthe correct executions of transactions. We discuss the concurrency control prob-\\nlem, which occurs when multiple transactions submitted by various users interfere \\nwith one another in a way that produces incorrect results. We also discuss the prob-lems that can occur when transactions fail, and how the database system can recover from various types of failures.\\nThis chapter is organized as follows. Section 20.1 informally discusses why concur-\\nrency control and recovery are necessary in a database system. Section 20.2 defines the term transaction  and discusses additional concepts related to transaction chapter 20'),\n",

Section 20.3 presents the important properties of \\natomicity, consistency preservation, isolation, and durability or permanency—called the ACID properties—that are considered desirable in transaction process-ing systems.

Sec-\\ntion\\xa020.5 discusses the notion of serializability  of concurrent transaction execution, \\nwhich can be used to define correct execution sequences (or schedules) of concur-rent transactions. In Section 20.6, we present some of the commands that support the transaction concept in SQL, and we introduce the concepts of isolation levels. Section 20.7 summarizes the chapter.\\nThe two following chapters continue with more details on the actual methods and \\ntechniques used to support transaction processing. Chapter 21 gives an overview of the basic concurrency control protocols and Chapter 22 introduces recovery techniques.\\n20.1 Introduction to Transaction Processing\\nIn this section, we discuss the concepts of concurrent execution of transactions and recovery from transaction failures. Section 20.1.1 compares single-user and multi-user database systems and demonstrates how concurrent execution of transactions can take place in multiuser systems. Section 20.1.2 defines the concept of transac-tion and presents a simple model of transaction execution based on read and write database operations. This model is used as the basis for defining and formalizing concurrency control and recovery concepts. Section 20.1.3 uses informal examples to show why concurrency control techniques are needed in multiuser systems. Finally, Section 20.1.4 discusses why techniques are needed to handle recovery from system and transaction failures by discussing the different ways in which transactions can fail while executing.\\n20.1.1 Single-User versus Multiuser Systems\\nOne criterion for classifying a database system is according to the number of users who can use the system concurrently . A DBMS is single-user  if at most one user at \\na time can use the system, and it is multiuser  if many users can use the system—\\nand hence access the database—concurrently. Single-user DBMSs are mostly restricted to personal computer systems; most other DBMSs are multiuser. For example, an airline reservations system is used by hundreds of users and travel agents concurrently. Database systems used in banks, insurance agencies, stock exchanges, supermarkets, and many other applications are multiuser systems. In these systems, hundreds or thousands of users are typically operating on the data-base by submitting transactions concurrently to the system.\\nMultiple users can access databases—and use computer systems—simultaneously \\nbecause of the concept of multiprogramming , which allows the operating system of \\nthe computer to execute multiple programs—or processes —at the same time. A single'),\n",

How-\\never, multiprogramming operating systems  execute some commands from one pro-\\ncess, then suspend that process and execute some commands from the next process, and so on. A process is resumed at the point where it was suspended whenever it gets its turn to use the CPU again. Hence, concurrent execution of processes is actually interleaved , as illustrated in Figure 20.1, which shows two processes, A and B, execut-\\ning concurrently in an interleaved fashion. Interleaving keeps the CPU busy when a process requires an input or output (I/O) operation, such as reading a block from disk. The CPU is switched to execute another process rather than remaining idle during I/O time. Interleaving also prevents a long process from delaying other processes.\\nIf the computer system has multiple hardware processors (CPUs), parallel processing  \\nof multiple processes is possible, as illustrated by processes C and D in Figure 20.1. \\nMost of the theory concerning concurrency control in databases is developed in terms of interleaved concurrency , so for the remainder of this chapter we assume this model. \\nIn a multiuser DBMS, the stored data items are the primary resources that may be accessed concurrently by interactive users or application programs, which are con-stantly retrieving information from and modifying the database.\\n20.1.2  Transactions, Database Items, Read  \\nand Write Operations, and DBMS Buffers\\nA transaction  is an executing program that forms a logical unit of database pro-\\ncessing. A transaction includes one or more database access operations—these can \\ninclude insertion, deletion, modification (update), or retrieval operations. The \\ndatabase operations that form a transaction can either be embedded within an \\napplication program or they can be specified interactively via a high-level query \\nlanguage such as SQL. One way of specifying the transaction boundaries is by \\nspecifying explicit begin transaction  and end transaction  statements in an appli-\\ncation program; in this case, all database access operations between the two are considered as forming one transaction. A single application program may contain more than one transaction if it contains several transaction boundaries.

A database  is basically represented as a \\ncollection of named data items.  The size of a data item is called its granularity . A \\ndata item  can be a database record , but it can also be a larger unit such as a whole \\ndisk block , or even a smaller unit such as an individual field (attribute) value  of \\nsome record in the database. The transaction processing concepts we discuss are independent of the data item granularity (size) and apply to data items in general. Each data item has a unique name , but this name is not typically used by the pro-\\ngrammer; rather, it is just a means to uniquely identify each data item . For example, \\nif the data item granularity is one disk block, then the disk block address can be used as the data item name. If the item granularity is a single record, then the record id can be the item name. Using this simplified database model, the basic database access operations that a transaction can include are as follows:\\n ■read_item( X). Reads a database item named X into a program variable. To \\nsimplify our notation, we assume that the program variable is also named X.\\n ■write_item( X). Writes the value of program variable X into the database \\nitem named X.\\nAs we discussed in Chapter 16, the basic unit of data transfer from disk to main \\nmemory is one disk page (disk block). Executing a read_item (X) command includes \\nthe following steps:\\n  1. Find the address of the disk block that contains item X.\\n  2. Copy that disk block into a buffer in main memory (if that disk block is not \\nalready in some main memory buffer). The size of the buffer is the same as \\nthe disk block size.\\n  3. Copy item X from the buffer to the program variable named X.\\nExecuting a write_item (X) command includes the following steps:\\n  1. Find the address of the disk block that contains item X.\\n  2. Copy that disk block into a buffer in main memory (if that disk block is not \\nalready in some main memory buffer).\\n  3. Copy item X from the program variable named X into its correct location in \\nthe buffer.\\n  4. Store the updated disk block from the buffer back to disk (either immedi-ately or at some later point in time).\\nIt is step 4 that actually updates the database on disk. Sometimes the buffer is not \\nimmediately stored to disk, in case additional changes are to be made to the buffer. \\nUsually, the decision about when to store a modified disk block whose contents are in \\na main memory buffer is handled by the recovery manager of the DBMS in cooperation \\nwith the underlying operating system. The DBMS will maintain in the database cache'),\n",

Each buffer typically holds the contents \\nof one database disk block, which contains some of the database items being pro-cessed. When these buffers are all occupied, and additional database disk blocks must be copied into memory, some buffer replacement policy  is used to choose \\nwhich of the current occupied buffers is to be replaced. Some commonly used buffer replacement policies are LRU  (least recently used). If the chosen buffer has been \\nmodified, it must be written back to disk before it is reused.\\n1 There are also buffer \\nreplacement policies that are specific to DBMS characteristics. We briefly discuss a few of these in Section 20.2.4.\\nA transaction includes \\nread_item  and write_item  operations to access and update the \\ndatabase. Figure 20.2 shows examples of two very simple transactions. The read-set  \\nof a transaction is the set of all items that the transaction reads, and the write-set  is \\nthe set of all items that the transaction writes. For example, the read-set of T1 in \\nFigure 20.2 is { X, Y} and its write-set is also { X, Y}.\\nConcurrency control and recovery mechanisms are mainly concerned with the \\ndatabase commands in a transaction. Transactions submitted by the various users \\nmay execute concurrently and may access and update the same database items. If \\nthis concurrent execution is uncontrolled , it may lead to problems, such as an \\ninconsistent database. In the next section, we informally introduce some of the problems that may occur.\\n20.1.3 Why Concurrency Control Is Needed\\nSeveral problems can occur when concurrent transactions execute in an uncontrolled manner. We illustrate some of these problems by referring to a much simplified air-\\nline reservations database in which a record is stored for each airline flight. Each record includes the number of reserved seats  on that flight as a named (uniquely iden-\\ntifiable) data item , among other information. Figure 20.2(a) shows a transaction T\\n1 \\nthat transfers N  reservations from one flight whose number of reserved seats is stored \\nin the database item named X to another flight whose number of reserved seats is \\nstored in the database item named Y. Figure 20.2(b) shows a simpler transaction T2 \\nthat just reserves M  seats on the first flight ( X) referenced in transaction T1.2 To sim-\\nplify our example, we do not show additional portions of the transactions, such as checking whether a flight has enough seats available before reserving additional seats.\\nWhen a database access program is written, it has the flight number, the flight date, \\nand the number of seats to be booked as parameters; hence, the same program can be used to execute many different transactions , each with a different flight number, \\ndate, and number of seats to be booked. For concurrency control purposes, a trans-action is a particular execution  of a program on a specific date, flight, and number \\n1We will not discuss general-purpose buffer replacement policies here because they are typically discussed \\nin operating systems texts.\\n2A similar, more commonly used example assumes a bank database, with one transaction doing a transfer \\nof funds from account X to account Y and the other transaction doing a deposit to account X.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 780}, page_content='750 Chapter 20 Introduction to Transaction Processing Concepts and Theory\\nof seats. In Figures 20.2(a) and (b), the transactions T1 and T2 are specific executions  \\nof the programs that refer to the specific flights whose numbers of seats are stored in data items X and Y in the database. Next we discuss the types of problems we \\nmay encounter with these two simple transactions if they run concurrently.\\nThe Lost Update Problem. This problem occurs when two transactions that access \\nthe same database items have their operations interleaved in a way that makes the value of some database items incorrect. Suppose that transactions T\\n1 and T2 are submitted at \\napproximately the same time, and suppose that their operations are interleaved as shown in Figure 20.3(a); then the final value of item X is incorrect because T\\n2 reads the \\nvalue of X before T 1 changes it in the database, and hence the updated value resulting \\nfrom T1 is lost. For example, if X = 80 at the start (originally there were 80 reservations \\non the flight), N = 5 ( T1 transfers 5 seat reservations from the flight corresponding to X \\nto the flight corresponding to Y), and M = 4 ( T2 reserves 4 seats on X), the final result \\nshould be X = 79. However, in the interleaving of operations shown in Figure 20.3(a), it \\nis X = 84 because the update in T1 that removed the five seats from X was lost.\\nThe Temporary Update (or Dirty Read) Problem. This problem occurs when one \\ntransaction updates a database item and then the transaction fails for some reason (see Section 20.1.4). Meanwhile, the updated item is accessed (read) by another transaction before it is changed back (or rolled back) to its original value. Figure 20.3(b) shows an example where T\\n1 updates item X and then fails before completion, so the system must \\nroll back X to its original value. Before it can do so, however, transaction T2 reads the \\ntemporary  value of X, which will not be recorded permanently in the database because \\nof the failure of T1. The value of item X that is read by T2 is called dirty data  because it \\nhas been created by a transaction that has not completed and committed yet; hence, this problem is also known as the dirty read problem .\\nThe Incorrect Summary Problem. If one transaction is calculating an aggregate \\nsummary function on a number of database items while other transactions are \\nupdating some of these items, the aggregate function may calculate some values \\nbefore they are updated and others after they are updated. For example, suppose \\nthat a transaction T\\n3 is calculating the total number of reservations on all the flights; \\nmeanwhile, transaction T1 is executing. If the interleaving of operations shown in \\nFigure 20.3(c) occurs, the result of T3 will be off by an amount N because T3 reads \\nthe value of X after N  seats have been subtracted from it but reads the value of Y \\nbefore  those N seats have been added to it.(a)\\nread_item( X);\\nX := X – N;\\nwrite_item( X);\\nread_item( Y);\\nY := Y + N;\\nwrite_item( Y);(b)\\nread_item( X);\\nX := X + M;\\nwrite_item( X);T1 T2\\nFigure 20.2 \\nTwo sample  transactions. \\n(a) Transaction T\\n1. \\n(b) Transaction T2.'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 782}, page_content='752 Chapter 20 Introduction to Transaction Processing Concepts and Theory\\nThe Unrepeatable Read Problem. Another problem that may occur is called \\nunrepeatable read , where a transaction T reads the same item twice and the item is \\nchanged by another transaction T′ between the two reads. Hence, T receives differ-\\nent values  for its two reads of the same item. This may occur, for example, if during \\nan airline reservation transaction, a customer inquires about seat availability on several flights. When the customer decides on a particular flight, the transaction then reads the number of seats on that flight a second time before completing the reservation, and it may end up reading a different value for the item.\\n20.1.4 Why Recovery Is Needed\\nWhenever a transaction is submitted to a DBMS for execution, the system is responsible for making sure that either all the operations in the transaction are completed successfully and their effect is recorded permanently in the database, or that the transaction does not have any effect on the database or any other transactions. In the first case, the transaction is said to be committed , whereas \\nin the second case, the transaction is aborted . The DBMS must not permit some \\noperations of a transaction T to be applied to the database while other opera-\\ntions of T are not, because the whole transaction  is a logical unit of database \\nprocessing. If a transaction fails  after executing some of its operations but before \\nexecuting all of them, the operations already executed must be undone and have no lasting effect.\\nTypes of Failures. Failures are generally classified as transaction, system, and \\nmedia failures. There are several possible reasons for a transaction to fail in the middle of execution:\\n  1. A computer failure (system crash).  A hardware, software, or network error \\noccurs in the computer system during transaction execution. Hardware crashes are usually media failures—for example, main memory failure.\\n  2. A transaction or system error.  Some operation in the transaction may \\ncause it to fail, such as integer overflow or division by zero. Transaction fail-ure may also occur because of erroneous parameter values or because of a logical programming error.\\n3 Additionally, the user may interrupt the trans-\\naction during its execution.\\n  3. Local errors or exception conditions detected by the transaction.  During \\ntransaction execution, certain conditions may occur that necessitate cancel-lation of the transaction. For example, data for the transaction may not be found. An exception condition,\\n4 such as insufficient account balance in a \\nbanking database, may cause a transaction, such as a fund withdrawal, to be canceled. This exception could be programmed in the transaction itself, and in such a case would not be considered as a transaction failure.\\n3In general, a transaction should be thoroughly tested to ensure that it does not have any bugs (logical \\nprogramming errors).\\n4Exception conditions, if programmed correctly, do not constitute transaction failures.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 783}, page_content='20.2 Transaction and System Concepts  753\\n  4. Concurrency control enforcement.  The concurrency control method (see \\nChapter 21)may abort a transaction because it violates serializability (see Section 20.5), or it may abort one or more transactions to resolve a state of deadlock among several transactions (see Section 21.1.3). Transactions aborted because of serializability violations or deadlocks are typically restarted automatically at a later time.\\n  5. Disk failure.  Some disk blocks may lose their data because of a read or write \\nmalfunction or because of a disk read/write head crash. This may happen during a read or a write operation of the transaction.\\n  6. Physical problems and catastrophes.  This refers to an endless list of problems \\nthat includes power or air-conditioning failure, fire, theft, sabotage, overwrit-ing disks or tapes by mistake, and mounting of a wrong tape by the operator.\\nFailures of types 1, 2, 3, and 4 are more common than those of types 5 or 6. When-\\never a failure of type 1 through 4 occurs, the system must keep sufficient informa-tion to quickly recover from the failure. Disk failure or other catastrophic failures of type 5 or 6 do not happen frequently; if they do occur, recovery is a major task. We discuss recovery from failure in Chapter 22.\\nThe concept of transaction is fundamental to many techniques for concurrency \\ncontrol and recovery from failures.\\n20.2 Transaction and System Concepts\\nIn this section, we discuss additional concepts relevant to transaction processing. Section 20.2.1 describes the various states a transaction can be in and discusses \\nother operations needed in transaction processing. Section 20.2.2 discusses the \\n system log, which keeps information about transactions and data items that will be\\xa0needed for recovery. Section 20.2.3 describes the concept of commit points of transactions and why they are important in transaction processing. Finally, \\n Sec tion\\xa020.2.4 briefly discusses DBMS buffer replacement policies.\\n20.2.1 Transaction States and Additional Operations\\nA transaction is an atomic unit of work that should either be completed in its entirety \\nor not done at all. For recovery purposes, the system needs to keep track of when each transaction starts, terminates, and commits, or aborts (see Section 20.2.3). Therefore, the recovery manager of the DBMS needs to keep track of the following operations:\\n ■BEGIN_TRANSACTION . This marks the beginning of transaction execution.\\n ■READ  or WRITE . These specify read or write operations on the database \\nitems that are executed as part of a transaction.\\n ■END_TRANSACTION . This specifies that READ  and WRITE  transaction opera-\\ntions have ended and marks the end of transaction execution. However, at this point it may be necessary to check whether the changes introduced by the transaction can be permanently applied to the database (committed) or'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 784}, page_content='754 Chapter 20 Introduction to Transaction Processing Concepts and Theory\\nwhether the transaction has to be aborted because it violates serializability \\n(see Section 20.5) or for some other reason.\\n ■COMMIT_TRANSACTION . This signals a successful end  of the transaction so that \\nany changes (updates) executed by the transaction can be safely committed  to \\nthe database and will not be undone.\\n ■ROLLBACK  (or ABORT ). This signals that the transaction has ended unsuc-\\ncessfully,  so that any changes or effects that the transaction may have applied \\nto the database must be undone .\\nFigure 20.4 shows a state transition diagram that illustrates how a transaction \\nmoves through its execution states. A transaction goes into an active state  immedi-\\nately after it starts execution, where it can execute its READ  and WRITE  operations. \\nWhen the transaction ends, it moves to the partially committed state . At this \\npoint, some types of concurrency control protocols may do additional checks to see if the transaction can be committed or not. Also, some recovery protocols need to ensure that a system failure will not result in an inability to record the changes of the transaction permanently (usually by recording changes in the system log,  discussed in the next section).\\n5 If these checks are successful, the transaction is said \\nto have reached its commit point and enters the committed state . Commit points \\nare discussed in more detail in Section 20.2.3. When a transaction is committed, it has concluded its execution successfully and all its changes must be recorded perma nently in the database, even if a system failure occurs.\\nHowever, a transaction can go to the failed state  if one of the checks fails or if the trans-\\naction is aborted during its active state. The transaction may then have to be rolled back to undo the effect of its \\nWRITE  operations on the database. The terminated state  corre-\\nsponds to the transaction leaving the system. The transaction information that is main-tained in system tables while the transaction has been running is removed when the transaction terminates. Failed or aborted transactions may be restarted  later—either \\nautomatically or after being resubmitted by the user—as brand new transactions.\\n5Optimistic concurrency control (see Section 21.4) also requires that certain checks are made at this \\npoint to ensure that the transaction did not interfere with other executing transactions.ActiveBegin \\ntrans actionEnd \\ntransaction Commit\\nAbort AbortRead, Write\\nPartially committed\\nFailed TerminatedCommitted\\nFigure 20.4 \\nState transition diagram illustrating the states for transaction execution.'),\n",

The log is a sequential, append-only file that is kept on disk, so it is not affected by any type of failure except for disk or catastrophic failure. Typically, one (or more) main memory buffers, called the log buffers , \\nhold the last part of the log file, so that log entries are first added to the log main memory buffer. When the log buffer  is filled, or when certain other conditions \\noccur, the log buffer is appended to the end of the log file on disk . In addition, the \\nlog file from disk is periodically backed up to archival storage (tape) to guard against catastrophic failures. The following are the types of entries—called log \\nrecords —that are written to the log file and the corresponding action for each \\nlog record. In these entries, T refers to a unique transaction-id  that is generated \\nautomatically by the system for each transaction and that is used to identify each transaction:\\n  1. [start_transaction , T]. Indicates that transaction T has started execution.\\n  2. [write_item , T, X, old_value , new_value ]. Indicates that transaction T has \\nchanged the value of database item X from old_value  to new_value.\\n  3. [read_item , T, X]. Indicates that transaction T has read the value of database \\nitem X.\\n  4. [commit , T]. Indicates that transaction T has completed successfully, and affirms \\nthat its effect can be committed (recorded permanently) to the database.\\n  5. [abort , T]. Indicates that transaction T has been aborted.\\nProtocols for recovery that avoid cascading rollbacks (see Section 20.4.2)—which \\ninclude nearly all practical protocols— do not require  that READ  operations are \\nwritten to the system log. However, if the log is also used for other purposes—such as auditing (keeping track of all database operations)—then such entries can be included. Additionally, some recovery protocols require simpler \\nWRITE  entries \\nthat only include one of new_value  or old_value  instead of including both (see Sec-\\ntion 20.4.2).\\nNotice that we are assuming that all permanent changes to the database occur \\nwithin transactions, so the notion of recovery from a transaction failure amounts to either undoing or redoing transaction operations individually from the log. If the system crashes, we can recover to a consistent database state by examining the log and using one of the techniques described in Chapter 22. Because the log con-tains a record of every \\nWRITE  operation that changes the value of some database \\nitem, it is possible to undo  the effect of these WRITE  operations of a transaction T \\nby tracing backward through the log and resetting all items changed by a WRITE  \\noperation of T to their old_values .

Beyond the commit point, the transaction is said to be committed , and its effect must be permanently recorded  in \\nthe database. The transaction then writes a commit record [\\ncommit , T] into the log. \\nIf a system failure occurs, we can search back in the log for all transactions T that \\nhave written a [ start_transaction , T] record into the log but have not written their \\n[commit , T] record yet; these transactions may have to be rolled back  to undo their \\neffect  on the database during the recovery process. Transactions that have written \\ntheir commit record in the log must also have recorded all their WRITE  operations \\nin the log, so their effect on the database can be redone  from the log records.\\nNotice that the log file must be kept on disk. As discussed in Chapter 16, updating \\na disk file involves copying the appropriate block of the file from disk to a buffer in main memory, updating the buffer in main memory, and copying the buffer to disk. As we mentioned earlier, it is common to keep one or more blocks of the log file in main memory buffers, called the log buffer , until they are filled with log \\nentries and then to write them back to disk only once, rather than writing to disk every time a log entry is added. This saves the overhead of multiple disk writes of the same log file buffer. At the time of a system crash, only the log entries that have been written back to disk  are considered in the recovery process if the contents of \\nmain memory are lost. Hence, before  a transaction reaches its commit point, any \\nportion of the log that has not been written to the disk yet must now be written to the disk. This process is called force-writing  the log buffer to disk before commit-\\nting a transaction.\\n20.2.4 DBMS-Specific Buffer Replacement Policies\\nThe DBMS cache will hold the disk pages that contain information currently being processed in main memory buffers. If all the buffers in the DBMS cache are occu-pied and new disk pages are required to be loaded into main memory from disk, a page replacement policy  is needed to select the particular buffers to be replaced. \\nSome page replacement policies that have been developed specifically for database \\nsystems are briefly discussed next.\\nDomain Separation (DS) Method. In a DBMS, various types of disk pages \\nexist: index pages, data file pages, log file pages, and so on. In this method, the DBMS cache is divided into separate domains (sets of buffers). Each domain han-dles one type of disk pages, and page replacements within each domain are han-\\n7Undo and redo are discussed more fully in Chapter 22.'),\n",

Although this \\nachieves better performance on average that basic LRU, it is a static algorithm,  and \\nso does not adapt to dynamically changing loads because the number of available buffers for each domain is predetermined. Several variations of the DS page replacement policy have been proposed, which add dynamic load-balancing fea-tures. For example, the GRU  (Group LRU) gives each domain a priority level and \\nselects pages from the lowest-priority level domain first for replacement, whereas another method dynamically changes the number of buffers in each domain based on current workload.\\nHot Set Method. This page replacement algorithm is useful in queries that have \\nto scan a set of pages repeatedly, such as when a join operation is performed using the nested-loop method (see Chapter 18). If the inner loop file is loaded completely into main memory buffers without replacement (the hot set), the join will be per-formed efficiently because each page in the outer loop file will have to scan all the records in the inner loop file to find join matches. The hot set method determines for each database processing algorithm the set of disk pages that will be accessed repeatedly, and it does not replace them until their processing is completed.\\nThe DBMIN Method. This page replacement policy uses a model known as QLSM  \\n(query locality set model), which predetermines the pattern of page references for each algorithm for a particular type of database operation. We discussed various algorithms for relational operations such as SELECT and JOIN in Chapter 18. \\nDepending on the type of access method, the file characteristics, and the algorithm \\nused, the QLSM will estimate the number of main memory buffers needed for each file involved in the operation. The DBMIN page replacement policy will calculate a locality set  using QLSM for each file instance involved in the query (some queries \\nmay reference the same file twice, so there would be a locality set for each file instance needed in the query). DBMIN then allocates the appropriate number of buffers to each file instance involved in the query based on the locality set for that file instance. The concept of locality set is analogous to the concept of working set , \\nwhich is used in page replacement policies for processes by the operating system but there are multiple locality sets, one for each file instance in the query.\\n20.3 Desirable Properties of Transactions\\nTransactions should possess several properties, often called the ACID  properties; \\nthey should be enforced by the concurrency control and recovery methods of the DBMS. The following are the ACID properties:\\n ■Atomicity.  A transaction is an atomic unit of processing; it should either be \\nperformed in its entirety or not performed at all.\\n ■Consistency preservation.  A transaction should be consistency preserving, \\nmeaning that if it is completely executed from beginning to end without interference from other transactions, it should take the database from one consistent state to another.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 788}, page_content='758 Chapter 20 Introduction to Transaction Processing Concepts and Theory\\n ■Isolation.  A transaction should appear as though it is being executed in iso-\\nlation from other transactions, even though many transactions are execut-ing concurrently. That is, the execution of a transaction should not be interfered with by any other transactions executing concurrently.\\n ■Durability or permanency.  The changes applied to the database by a com-\\nmitted transaction must persist in the database. These changes must not be lost because of any failure.\\nThe atomicity property  requires that we execute a transaction to completion. It is \\nthe responsibility of the transaction recovery subsystem  of a DBMS to ensure atomi-\\ncity. If a transaction fails to complete for some reason, such as a system crash in the midst of transaction execution, the recovery technique must undo any effects of the transaction on the database. On the other hand, write operations of a committed transaction must be eventually written to disk.\\nThe preservation of consistency  is generally considered to be the responsibility of \\nthe programmers who write the database programs and of the DBMS module that enforces integrity constraints. Recall that a database state  is a collection of \\nall the stored data items (values) in the database at a given point in time. A  consistent state  of the database satisfies the constraints specified in the schema \\nas well as any other constraints on the database that should hold. A database program should be written in a way that guarantees that, if the database is in a consistent state before executing the transaction, it will be in a consistent state after the complete  execution of the transaction, assuming that no interference \\nwith other transactions  occurs.\\nThe isolation property  is enforced by the concurrency control subsystem  of the \\nDBMS.\\n8 If every transaction does not make its updates (write operations) visible to \\nother transactions until it is committed, one form of isolation is enforced that \\nsolves the temporary update problem and eliminates cascading rollbacks (see \\nChapter 22) but does not eliminate all other problems.\\nThe durability property  is the responsibility of the recovery subsystem  of the DBMS. \\nIn the next section, we introduce how recovery protocols enforce durability and \\natomicity and then discuss this in more detail in Chapter 22.\\nLevels of Isolation.  There have been attempts to define the level of isolation  of a \\ntransaction. A transaction is said to have level 0 (zero) isolation if it does not over-\\nwrite the dirty reads of higher-level transactions. Level 1 (one) isolation has no lost updates, and level 2 isolation has no lost updates and no dirty reads. Finally, level 3 isolation (also called true isolation ) has, in addition to level 2 properties, repeatable \\nreads.\\n9 Another type of isolation is called snapshot isolation , and several practical \\nconcurrency control methods are based on this. We shall discuss snapshot isolation \\nin Section 20.6, and again in Chapter 21, Section 21.4.\\n8We will discuss concurrency control protocols in Chapter 21.\\n9The SQL syntax for isolation level discussed in Section 20.6 is closely related to these levels.'),\n",

In this section, first we define the concept of schedules, and \\nthen we characterize the types of schedules that facilitate recovery when failures \\noccur. In Section 20.5, we characterize schedules in terms of the interference of \\nparticipating transactions; this discussion leads to the concepts of serializability and serializable schedules.\\n20.4.1 Schedules (Histories) of Transactions\\nA schedule  (or history ) S of n transactions T1, T2, … , Tn is an ordering of the \\noperations of the transactions. Operations from different transactions can be interleaved in the schedule S. However, for each transaction T\\ni that participates \\nin the schedule S, the operations of Ti in S must appear in the same order in \\nwhich they occur in Ti. The order of operations in S is considered to be a total \\nordering , meaning that for any two operations  in the schedule, one must occur \\nbefore the other. It is possible theoretically to deal with schedules whose opera-tions form partial orders , but we will assume for now total ordering of the opera-\\ntions in a schedule.\\nFor the purpose of recovery and concurrency control, we are mainly interested in \\nthe \\nread_item  and write_item  operations of the transactions, as well as the commit  and \\nabort  operations. A shorthand notation for describing a schedule uses the symbols \\nb, r, w, e, c, and a for the operations begin_transaction , read_item , write_item ,  \\nend_transaction , commit , and abort , respectively, and appends as a subscript  the \\ntransaction id (transaction number) to each operation in the schedule. In this notation, the database item X that is read or written follows the r and w operations \\nin parentheses. In some schedules, we will only show the read  and write  operations, \\nwhereas in other schedules we will show additional operations, such as commit or abort. The schedule in Figure 20.3(a), which we shall call S\\na, can be written as  follows \\nin this notation:\\nSa: r1(X); r2(X); w1(X); r1(Y); w2(X); w1(Y);\\nSimilarly, the schedule for Figure 20.3(b), which we call Sb, can be written as fol-\\nlows, if we assume that transaction T1 aborted after its read_item (Y) operation:\\nSb: r1(X); w1(X); r2(X); w2(X); r1(Y); a1;\\nConflicting Operations in a Schedule. Two operations in a schedule are said to \\nconflict  if they satisfy all three of the following conditions: (1) they belong to differ-\\nent transactions ; (2) they access the same item X ; and (3) at least one  of the opera-\\ntions is a write_item (X). For example, in schedule Sa, the operations r1(X) and w2(X) \\nconflict, as do the operations r2(X) and w1(X), and the operations w1(X) and w2(X). \\nHowever, the operations r1(X) and r2(X) do not conflict, since they are both read'),\n",

For example, if we change the order of the two operations r1(X); \\nw2(X) to w2(X); r1(X), then the value of X that is read by transaction T1 changes, \\nbecause in the second ordering the value of X is read by r1(X) after  it is changed by \\nw2(X), whereas in the first ordering the value is read before  it is changed. This is \\ncalled a read-write conflict . The other type is called a write-write conflict  and is \\nillustrated by the case where we change the order of two operations such as w1(X); \\nw2(X) to w2(X); w1(X). For a write-write conflict, the last value  of X will differ \\nbecause in one case it is written by T2 and in the other case by T1. Notice that two \\nread operations are not conflicting because changing their order makes no differ-ence in outcome.\\nThe rest of this section covers some theoretical definitions concerning schedules. A \\nschedule S of n transactions T\\n1, T2, … , Tn is said to be a complete schedule  if the \\nfollowing conditions hold:\\n  1. The operations in S are exactly those operations in T1, T2, … , Tn, including \\na commit or abort operation as the last operation for each transaction in \\nthe schedule.\\n  2. For any pair of operations from the same transaction Ti, their relative order \\nof appearance in S is the same as their order of appearance in Ti.\\n  3. For any two conflicting operations, one of the two must occur before the \\nother in the schedule.10\\nThe preceding condition (3) allows for two nonconflicting operations  to occur in \\nthe schedule without defining which occurs first, thus leading to the definition of \\na schedule as a partial order  of the operations in the n transactions.11 However, a \\ntotal order must be specified in the schedule for any pair of conflicting operations (condition 3) and for any pair of operations from the same transaction (condi-tion 2). Condition 1 simply states that all operations in the transactions must \\nappear in the complete schedule. Since every transaction has either committed or\\xa0aborted, a complete schedule will not contain any active transactions  at the end \\nof the schedule.\\nIn general, it is difficult to encounter complete schedules in a transaction process-\\ning system because new transactions are continually being submitted to the system. Hence, it is useful to define the concept of the committed projection  C(S) of a \\nschedule S, which includes only the operations in S that belong to committed trans-\\nactions—that is, transactions T\\ni whose commit operation ci is in S.\\n10Theoretically, it is not necessary to determine an order between pairs of nonconflicting  operations.\\n11In practice, most schedules have a total order of operations. If parallel processing is employed, it is \\ntheoretically possible to have schedules with partially ordered nonconflicting operations.'),\n",

In some cases, it is even not possible to recover correctly after a failure. Hence, it is impor-tant to characterize the types of schedules for which recovery is possible , as well as \\nthose for which recovery is relatively simple . These characterizations do not actually \\nprovide the recovery algorithm; they only attempt to theoretically characterize the different types of schedules.\\nFirst, we would like to ensure that, once a transaction T is committed, it should \\nnever  be necessary to roll back T. This ensures that the durability property of \\ntransactions is not violated (see Section 20.3). The schedules that theoretically meet this criterion are called recoverable schedules.  A schedule where a committed \\ntransaction may have to be rolled back during recovery is called nonrecoverable  \\nand hence should not be permitted by the DBMS. The condition for a recoverable \\nschedule  is as follows: A schedule S is recoverable if no transaction T in S commits \\nuntil all transactions T′ that have written some item X that T reads have commit-\\nted. A transaction T reads  from transaction T′ in a schedule S if some item X is \\nfirst written by T′ and later read by T. In addition, T′ should not have been aborted \\nbefore T reads item X, and there should be no transactions that write X after T′ \\nwrites it and before T reads it (unless those transactions, if any, have aborted \\nbefore T reads X).\\nSome recoverable schedules may require a complex recovery process, as we shall \\nsee, but if sufficient information is kept (in the log), a recovery algorithm can be devised for any recoverable schedule. The (partial) schedules S\\na and Sb from the \\npreceding section are both recoverable, since they satisfy the above definition. Con-sider the schedule S\\na′ given below, which is the same as schedule Sa except that two \\ncommit operations have been added to Sa:\\nSa′: r1(X); r2(X); w1(X); r1(Y); w2(X); c2; w1(Y); c1;\\nSa′ is recoverable, even though it suffers from the lost update problem; this problem \\nis handled by serializability theory (see Section 20.5). However, consider the two (partial) schedules S\\nc and Sd that follow:\\nSc: r1(X); w1(X); r2(X); r1(Y); w2(X); c2; a1;\\nSd: r1(X); w1(X); r2(X); r1(Y); w2(X); w1(Y); c1; c2;\\nSe: r1(X); w1(X); r2(X); r1(Y); w2(X); w1(Y); a1; a2;\\nSc is not recoverable because T2 reads item X from T1, but T2 commits before T1 \\ncommits. The problem occurs if T1 aborts after the c2 operation in Sc; then the value \\nof X that T2 read is no longer valid and T2 must be aborted after  it is committed, \\nleading to a schedule that is not recoverable . For the schedule to be recoverable, the \\nc2 operation in Sc must be postponed until after T1 commits, as shown in Sd. If T1 \\naborts instead of committing, then T2 should also abort as shown in Se, because the \\nvalue of X it read is no longer valid. In Se, aborting T2 is acceptable since it has not \\ncommitted yet, which is not the case for the nonrecoverable schedule Sc.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 792}, page_content='762 Chapter 20 Introduction to Transaction Processing Concepts and Theory\\nIn a recoverable schedule, no committed transaction ever needs to be rolled back, \\nand so the definition of a committed transaction as durable is not violated. How-ever, it is possible for a phenomenon known as cascading rollback  (or cascading \\nabort ) to occur in some recoverable schedules, where an uncommitted  transaction \\nhas to be rolled back because it read an item from a transaction that failed. This is illustrated in schedule S\\ne, where transaction T2 has to be rolled back because it read \\nitem X from T1, and T1 then aborted.\\nBecause cascading rollback can be time-consuming—since numerous transactions \\ncan be rolled back (see Chapter 22)—it is important to characterize the schedules where this phenomenon is guaranteed not to occur. A schedule is said to be cascadeless , or to avoid cascading rollback , if every transaction in the schedule \\nreads only items that were written by committed transactions. In this case, all items read will not be discarded because the transactions that wrote them have commit-ted, so no cascading rollback will occur. To satisfy this criterion, the r\\n2(X) com-\\nmand in schedules Sd and Se must be postponed until after T1 has committed (or \\naborted), thus delaying T2 but ensuring no cascading rollback if T1 aborts.\\nFinally, there is a third, more restrictive type of schedule, called a strict schedule , in \\nwhich transactions can neither read nor write  an item X until the last transaction \\nthat wrote X has committed (or aborted). Strict schedules simplify the recovery \\nprocess. In a strict schedule, the process of undoing a write_item (X) operation of an \\naborted transaction is simply to restore the before image  (old_value  or BFIM) of \\ndata item X. This simple procedure always works correctly for strict schedules, but \\nit may not work for recoverable or cascadeless schedules. For example, consider \\nschedule Sf:\\nSf: w1(X, 5); w2(X, 8); a1;\\nSuppose that the value of X was originally 9, which is the before image stored in the \\nsystem log along with the w1(X, 5) operation. If T1 aborts, as in Sf, the recovery pro-\\ncedure that restores the before image of an aborted write operation will restore the \\nvalue of X to 9, even though it has already been changed to 8 by transaction T2, thus \\nleading to potentially incorrect results. Although schedule Sf is cascadeless, it is not \\na strict schedule, since it permits T2 to write item X even though the transaction T1 \\nthat last wrote X had not yet committed (or aborted). A strict schedule does not \\nhave this problem.\\nIt is important to note that any strict schedule is also cascadeless, and any cascade-\\nless schedule is also recoverable. Suppose we have i transactions T1, T2, … , Ti, and \\ntheir number of operations are n1, n2, … , ni, respectively. If we make a set of all \\npossible schedules  of these transactions, we can divide the schedules into two dis-\\njoint subsets: recoverable and nonrecoverable. The cascadeless schedules will be a \\nsubset of the recoverable schedules, and the strict schedules will be a subset of the \\ncascadeless schedules. Thus, all strict schedules are cascadeless, and all cascadeless schedules are recoverable.\\nMost recovery protocols allow only strict schedules, so that the recovery process \\nitself is not complicated (see Chapter 22).'),\n",

Now we characterize the types of schedules that are always considered to be correct  when concurrent transactions are executing. Such schedules are known \\nas serializable schedules . Suppose that two users—for example, two airline reserva-\\ntions agents—submit to the DBMS transactions T\\n1 and T2 in Figure 20.2 at approx-\\nimately the same time. If no interleaving of operations is permitted, there are only two possible outcomes:\\n  1. Execute all the operations of transaction T1 (in sequence) followed by all the \\noperations of transaction T2 (in sequence).\\n  2. Execute all the operations of transaction T2 (in sequence) followed by all the \\noperations of transaction T1 (in sequence).\\nThese two schedules—called serial schedules —are shown in Figures 20.5(a) and (b), \\nrespectively. If interleaving of operations is allowed, there will be many possible orders in which the system can execute the individual operations of the trans-actions. Two possible schedules are shown in Figure 20.5(c). The concept of  serializability of schedules  is used to identify which schedules are correct when \\ntransaction executions have interleaving of their operations in the schedules. This section defines serializability and discusses how it may be used in practice.\\n20.5.1 Serial, Nonserial, and Conflict-Serializable Schedules\\nSchedules A and B in Figures 20.5(a) and (b) are called serial  because the operations \\nof each transaction are executed consecutively, without any interleaved operations from the other transaction. In a serial schedule, entire transactions are performed in serial order: T\\n1 and then T2 in Figure 20.5(a), and T2 and then T1 in Figure\\xa020.5(b). \\nSchedules C and D in Figure 20.5(c) are called nonserial  because each sequence \\ninterleaves operations from the two transactions.\\nFormally, a schedule S is serial  if, for every transaction T participating in the sched-\\nule, all the operations of T are executed consecutively in the schedule; otherwise, the \\nschedule is called nonserial . Therefore, in a serial schedule, only one transaction at a \\ntime is active—the commit (or abort) of the active transaction initiates execution of \\nthe next transaction. No interleaving occurs in a serial schedule. One reasonable \\nassumption we can make, if we consider the transactions to be independent , is that \\nevery serial schedule is considered correct . We can assume this because every transac-\\ntion is assumed to be correct if executed on its own (according to the consistency \\npreservation  property of Section 20.3). Hence, it does not matter which transaction is \\nexecuted first. As long as every transaction is executed from beginning to end in isolation from the operations of other transactions, we get a correct end result.\\nThe problem with serial schedules is that they limit concurrency by prohibiting \\ninterleaving of operations. In a serial schedule, if a transaction waits for an I/O'),\n",

Additionally, if some transaction T is \\nlong, the other transactions must wait for T to complete all its operations before \\nstarting. Hence, serial schedules are unacceptable  in practice. However, if we can \\ndetermine which other schedules are equivalent  to a serial schedule, we can allow \\nthese schedules to occur.\\nTo illustrate our discussion, consider the schedules in Figure 20.5, and assume that \\nthe initial values of database items are X = 90 and Y = 90 and that N = 3 and M = 2. \\nAfter executing transactions T1 and T2, we would expect the database values to be \\nX = 89 and Y = 93, according to the meaning of the transactions. Sure enough, exe-\\ncuting either of the serial schedules A or B gives the correct results. Now consider (a)\\nSchedule A Schedule Bread_item( X);\\nX := X – N;\\nwrite_item( X);\\nread_item( Y);\\nread_item( X);\\nX := X + M;\\nwrite_item( X);Time\\nY := Y + N;\\nwrite_item( Y); (b)\\nread_item( X);\\nX := X + M;\\nwrite_item( X);\\nTimeread_item( X);\\nX := X – N;\\nwrite_item( X);\\nread_item( Y);\\nY := Y + N;\\nwrite_item( Y);\\n(c) T1 T2\\nSchedule C Schedule Dread_item( X);\\nX := X – N;\\nwrite_item( X);\\nread_item( Y);read_item( X);\\nX := X + M;\\nwrite_item( X);Time\\nY := Y + N;\\nwrite_item( Y);read_item( X);\\nX := X + M;\\nwrite_item( X);read_item( X);\\nX := X – N;\\nwrite_item( X);\\nread_item( Y);\\nY := Y + N;\\nwrite_item( Y);T1 T2T1 T2 T1 T2\\nTime\\nFigure 20.5 \\nExamples of serial and nonserial schedules involving transactions T1 and T2.

Schedule C (which is the same as Figure 20.3(a)) \\ngives the results X = 92 and Y = 93, in which the X value is erroneous, whereas \\nschedule D gives the correct results.\\nSchedule C gives an erroneous result because of the lost update problem  discussed \\nin Section 20.1.3; transaction T2 reads the value of X before it is changed by transac-\\ntion T1, so only the effect of T2 on X is reflected in the database. The effect of T1 on \\nX is lost, overwritten by T2, leading to the incorrect result for item X. However, \\nsome nonserial schedules give the correct expected result, such as schedule D. We would like to determine which of the nonserial schedules always  give a correct \\nresult and which may give erroneous results. The concept used to characterize schedules in this manner is that of serializability of a schedule.\\nThe definition of serializable schedule  is as follows: A schedule S of n transactions \\nis serializable  if it is equivalent to some serial schedule  of the same n transactions. \\nWe will define the concept of equivalence of schedules  shortly. Notice that there \\nare n! possible serial schedules of n transactions and many more possible non-\\nserial schedules. We can form two disjoint groups of the nonserial schedules—those that are equivalent to one (or more) of the serial schedules and hence are serializable, and those that are not equivalent to any serial schedule and hence are \\nnot serializable.\\nSaying that a nonserial schedule S is serializable is equivalent to saying that it is cor-\\nrect, because it is equivalent to a serial schedule, which is considered correct. The remaining question is: When are two schedules considered equivalent ?\\nThere are several ways to define schedule equivalence. The simplest but least sat-\\nisfactory definition involves comparing the effects of the schedules on the data-\\nbase. Two schedules are called result equivalent  if they produce the same final \\nstate of the database. However, two different schedules may accidentally produce the same final state. For example, in Figure 20.6, schedules S\\n1 and S2 will produce \\nthe same final database state if they execute on a database with an initial value of \\nX = 100; however, for other initial values of X, the schedules are not result equiva-\\nlent. Additionally, these schedules execute different transactions, so they defi-nitely should not be considered equivalent. Hence, result equivalence alone cannot be used to define equivalence of schedules. The safest and most general approach to defining schedule equivalence is to focus only on the read_item and write_item operations of the transactions, and not make any assumptions about \\nthe other internal operations included in the transactions. For two schedules to be equivalent, the operations applied to each data item affected by the schedules should be applied to that item in both schedules in the same order . Two defini-\\ntions of equivalence of schedules are generally used: conflict equivalence  and view \\nequivalence . We discuss conflict equivalence next, which is the more commonly \\nused definition.\\nConflict Equivalence of Two Schedules. Two schedules are said to be conflict \\nequivalent  if the relative order of any two conflicting operations  is the same in both \\nschedules. Recall from Section 20.4.1 that two operations in a schedule are said to'),\n",

For example, as we discussed in Section 20.4.1, if a read and write operation occur in the order r\\n1(X), w2(X) in \\nschedule S1, and in the reverse order w2(X), r1(X) in schedule S2, the value read by \\nr1(X) can be different in the two schedules. Similarly, if two write operations occur \\nin the order w1(X), w2(X) in S1, and in the reverse order w2(X), w1(X) in S2, the next \\nr(X) operation in the two schedules will read potentially different values; or if these \\nare the last operations writing item X in the schedules, the final value of item X in \\nthe database will be different.\\nSerializable Schedules. Using the notion of conflict equivalence, we define a \\nschedule S to be serializable12 if it is (conflict) equivalent to some serial schedule S′. \\nIn such a case, we can reorder the nonconflicting  operations in S until we form the \\nequivalent serial schedule S′. According to this definition, schedule D in Fig-\\nure\\xa020.5(c) is equivalent to the serial schedule A in Figure 20.5(a). In both schedules, \\nthe read_item (X) of T2 reads the value of X written by T1, whereas the other read_item  \\noperations read the database values from the initial database state. Additionally, T1 \\nis the last transaction to write Y, and T2 is the last transaction to write X in both \\nschedules. Because A is a serial schedule and schedule D is equivalent to A, D is a serializable schedule. Notice that the operations r\\n1(Y) and w1(Y) of schedule D do \\nnot conflict with the operations r2(X) and w2(X), since they access different data \\nitems. Therefore, we can move r1(Y), w1(Y) before r2(X), w2(X), leading to the \\nequivalent serial schedule T1, T2.\\nSchedule C in Figure 20.5(c) is not equivalent to either of the two possible serial \\nschedules A and B, and hence is not serializable . Trying to reorder the operations of \\nschedule C to find an equivalent serial schedule fails because r2(X) and w1(X) con-\\nflict, which means that we cannot move r2(X) down to get the equivalent serial \\nschedule T1, T2. Similarly, because w1(X) and w2(X) conflict, we cannot move w1(X) \\ndown to get the equivalent serial schedule T2, T1.\\nAnother, more complex definition of equivalence—called view equivalence , which \\nleads to the concept of view serializability—is discussed in Section 20.5.4.S1\\nread_item( X);\\nX := X + 10;\\nwrite_item( X);S2\\nread_item( X);\\nX := X * 1.1;\\nwrite_item ( X);Figure 20.6 \\nTwo schedules that are result equivalent for the initial value of X = 100 but are not result \\nequivalent in general.\\n12We will use serializable  to mean conflict serializable.

Most concurrency control methods do not actually test for \\nserializability. Rather protocols, or rules, are developed that guarantee that any schedule that follows these rules will be serializable. Some methods guarantee seri-alizability in most cases, but do not guarantee it absolutely, in order to reduce the overhead of concurrency control. We discuss the algorithm for testing conflict seri-alizability of schedules here to gain a better understanding of these concurrency control protocols, which are discussed in Chapter 21.\\nAlgorithm 20.1 can be used to test a schedule for conflict serializability. The algo-\\nrithm looks at only the \\nread_item  and write_item  operations in a schedule to con-\\nstruct a precedence graph  (or serialization graph ), which is a directed graph   \\nG = (N, E) that consists of a set of nodes N = {T1, T2, … , Tn } and a set of directed \\nedges E = {e1, e2, … , em }. There is one node in the graph for each transaction Ti in \\nthe schedule. Each edge ei in the graph is of the form ( Tj → Tk ), 1 ≤ j ≤ n, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, \\nwhere Tj is the starting node  of ei and Tk is the ending node  of e i. Such an edge \\nfrom node Tj to node Tk is created by the algorithm if a pair of conflicting opera tions \\nexist in Tj and Tk and the conflicting operation in Tj appears in the schedule before  \\nthe conflicting operation  in Tk.\\nAlgorithm 20.1.  Testing Conflict Serializability of a Schedule S\\n  1. For each transaction Ti participating in schedule S, create a node labeled \\nTi in the precedence graph.\\n  2. For each case in S where Tj executes a read_item (X) after Ti executes a \\nwrite_item (X), create an edge ( Ti → Tj) in the precedence graph.\\n  3. For each case in S where Tj executes a write_item (X) after Ti executes a \\nread_item (X), create an edge ( Ti → Tj) in the precedence graph.\\n  4. For each case in S where Tj executes a write_item (X) after Ti executes a \\nwrite_item (X), create an edge ( Ti → Tj) in the precedence graph.\\n  5. The schedule S is serializable if and only if the precedence graph has no \\ncycles.\\nThe precedence graph is constructed as described in Algorithm 20.1. If there is a \\ncycle in the precedence graph, schedule S is not (conflict) serializable; if there is no \\ncycle, S is serializable. A cycle  in a directed graph is a sequence of edges  C = ((Tj → Tk), \\n(Tk → Tp), … , ( Ti → Tj)) with the property that the starting node of each edge—\\nexcept the first edge—is the same as the ending node of the previous edge, and the starting node of the first edge is the same as the ending node of the last edge (the sequence starts and ends at the same node).\\nIn the precedence graph, an edge from T\\ni to Tj means that transaction Ti must come \\nbefore transaction Tj in any serial schedule that is equivalent to S, because two con-\\nflicting operations appear in the schedule in that order. If there is no cycle in the pre-cedence graph, we can create an equivalent serial schedule  S′ that is equivalent to S, \\nby ordering the transactions that participate in S as follows: Whenever an edge exists'),\n",

Figure 20.7 shows such labels on the edges. When checking for a cycle, the labels are not relevant.\\nIn general, several serial schedules can be equivalent to S if the precedence graph for \\nS has no cycle. However, if the precedence graph has a cycle, it is easy to show that \\nwe cannot create any equivalent serial schedule, so S is not serializable. The prece-\\ndence graphs created for schedules A to D, respectively, in Figure 20.5 appear in Figures 20.7(a) to (d). The graph for schedule C has a cycle, so it is not serializable. The graph for schedule D has no cycle, so it is serializable, and the equivalent serial schedule is T\\n1 followed by T2. The graphs for schedules A and B have no cycles, as \\nexpected, because the schedules are serial and hence serializable.\\nAnother example, in which three transactions participate, is shown in Figure 20.8. \\nFigure 20.8(a) shows the read_item  and write_item  operations in each transaction. \\nTwo schedules E and F for these transactions are shown in Figures 20.8(b) and (c), \\nrespectively, and the precedence graphs for schedules E and F are shown in Fig-ures\\xa020.8(d) and (e).

To find an equivalent serial schedule, start \\nwith a node that does not have any incoming edges, and then make sure that the node order for every edge is not violated.\\n20.5.3 How Serializability Is Used for Concurrency Control\\nAs we discussed earlier, saying that a schedule S is (conflict) serializable—that is, S \\nis (conflict) equivalent to a serial schedule—is tantamount to saying that S is cor-\\nrect. Being serializable  is distinct from being serial , however. A serial schedule rep-\\nresents inefficient processing because no interleaving of operations from different transactions is permitted. This can lead to low CPU utilization while a transaction waits for disk I/O, or for a long transaction to delay other transactions, thus slowing down transaction processing considerably. A serializable schedule gives the benefits of concurrent execution without giving up any correctness. In practice, it is difficult to test for the serializability of a schedule. The interleaving of operations from con-current transactions—which are usually executed as processes by the operating system—is typically determined by the operating system scheduler, which allocates (d)\\nXY\\nY Y, ZT1Equivalent serial schedules\\nNone\\nReasonCycle X (T\\n1        T2),Y(T2        T1)\\nCycle X (T1        T2),YZ (T2       T3),Y(T3        T1)\\n(e) X,Y\\nY Y, ZEquivalent serial schedules\\n(f) Equivalent serial schedulesT2\\nT3\\nT1 T2\\nT3\\nT1 T2\\nT3T2 T3 T1T2 T3 T1\\nT1 T3 T2Figure 20.8 (continued) \\nAnother example of serializability testing.

Factors such as system load, time of transaction submis-\\nsion, and priorities of processes contribute to the ordering of operations in a sched-ule. Hence, it is difficult to determine how the operations of a schedule will be interleaved beforehand to ensure serializability. \\nIf transactions are executed at will and then the resulting schedule is tested for seri-\\nalizability, we must cancel the effect of the schedule if it turns out not to be serializ-\\nable. This is a serious problem that makes this approach impractical. The approach \\ntaken in most commercial DBMSs is to design protocols  (sets of rules) that—if \\nfollowed by every  individual transaction or if enforced by a DBMS concurrency \\ncontrol subsystem—will ensure serializability of all schedules in which the transac-\\ntions participate . Some protocols may allow nonserializable schedules in rare cases \\nto reduce the overhead of the concurrency control method (see Section 20.6).\\nAnother problem is that transactions are submitted continuously to the system, so \\nit is difficult to determine when a schedule begins and when it ends. Serializability theory can be adapted to deal with this problem by considering only the committed projection of a schedule S. Recall from Section 20.4.1 that the committed projection \\nC(S) of a schedule S includes only the operations in S that belong to committed \\ntransactions. We can theoretically define a schedule S to be serializable if its com-\\nmitted projection C(S) is equivalent to some serial schedule, since only committed \\ntransactions are guaranteed by the DBMS.\\nIn Chapter 21, we discuss a number of different concurrency control protocols \\nthat guarantee serializability. The most common technique, called two-phase \\nlocking , is based on locking data items to prevent concurrent transactions from \\ninterfering with one another, and enforcing an additional condition that guaran-tees serializability. This is used in some commercial DBMSs. We will also discuss a protocol based on the concept of snapshot isolation  that ensures serializability \\nin most but not all cases; this is used in some commercial DBMSs because it has less overhead than the two-phase locking protocol. Other protocols have been proposed\\n14; these include timestamp ordering , where each transaction is assigned \\na unique timestamp and the protocol ensures that any conflicting operations are \\nexecuted in the order of the transaction timestamps; multiversion protocols , \\nwhich are based on maintaining multiple versions of data items; and optimistic  \\n(also called certification  or validation ) protocols , which check for possible serial-\\nizability violations after the transactions terminate but before they are permitted to commit.\\n20.5.4 View Equivalence and View Serializability\\nIn Section 20.5.1, we defined the concepts of conflict equivalence of schedules and conflict serializability. Another less restrictive definition of equivalence of sched-ules is called view equivalence . This leads to another definition of serializability \\n14These other protocols have not been incorporated much into commercial systems; most relational \\nDBMSs use some variation of two-phase locking or snapshot isolation.'),\n",

Two schedules S and S′ are said to be view equivalent  if \\nthe following three conditions hold:\\n  1. The same set of transactions participates in S and S′, and S and S′ include the \\nsame operations of those transactions.\\n  2. For any operation ri(X) of Ti in S, if the value of X read by the operation has \\nbeen written by an operation wj(X) of Tj (or if it is the original value of X \\nbefore the schedule started), the same condition must hold for the value of X \\nread by operation ri(X) of Ti in S′.\\n  3. If the operation wk(Y) of Tk is the last operation to write item Y in S, then \\nwk(Y) of Tk must also be the last operation to write item Y in S′.\\nThe idea behind view equivalence is that, as long as each read operation of a trans-\\naction reads the result of the same write operation in both schedules, the write operations of each transaction must produce the same results. The read operations are hence said to see the same view  in both schedules. Condition 3 ensures that the \\nfinal write operation on each data item is the same in both schedules, so the data-base state should be the same at the end of both schedules. A schedule S is said to be \\nview serializable  if it is view equivalent to a serial schedule.\\nThe definitions of conflict serializability and view serializability are similar if a \\ncondition known as the constrained write assumption  (or no blind writes ) holds \\non all transactions in the schedule. This condition states that any write operation w\\ni(X) in Ti is preceded by a ri(X) in Ti and that the value written by wi(X) in Ti \\ndepends only on the value of X read by ri(X). This assumes that computation of \\nthe new value of X is a function f(X) based on the old value of X read from the \\ndatabase. A blind write  is a write operation in a transaction T on an item X that is \\nnot dependent on the old value of X, so it is not preceded by a read of X in the \\ntransaction T.\\nThe definition of view serializability is less restrictive than that of conflict serializ-\\nability under the unconstrained write assumption , where the value written by an \\noperation wi(X) in Ti can be independent of its old value. This is possible when \\nblind writes  are allowed, and it is illustrated by the following schedule Sg of three \\ntransactions T1: r1(X); w1(X); T2: w2(X); and T3: w3(X):\\nSg: r1(X); w2(X); w1(X); w3(X); c1; c2; c3;\\nIn Sg the operations w2(X) and w3(X) are blind writes, since T2 and T3 do not read \\nthe value of X. The schedule Sg is view serializable, since it is view equivalent to the \\nserial schedule T1, T2, T3. However, Sg is not conflict serializable, since it is not con-\\nflict equivalent to any serial schedule (as an exercise, the reader should construct the serializability graph for S\\ng and check for cycles). It has been shown that any \\nconflict-serializable schedule is also view serializable but not vice versa, as illus-trated by the preceding example. There is an algorithm to test whether a schedule S \\nis view serializable or not. However, the problem of testing for view serializability has been shown to be NP-hard, meaning that finding an efficient polynomial time algorithm for this problem is highly unlikely.'),\n",

Some applica-tions can produce schedules that are correct by satisfying conditions less strin-gent than either conflict serializability or view serializability. An example is the type of transactions known as debit-credit transactions —for example, those \\nthat apply deposits and withdrawals to a data item whose value is the current balance of a bank account. The semantics of debit-credit operations is that they update the value of a data item X by either subtracting from or adding to the \\nvalue of the data item. Because addition and subtraction operations are com-mutative—that is, they can be applied in any order—it is possible to produce correct schedules that are not serializable. For example, consider the following transactions, each of which may be used to transfer an amount of money between two bank accounts:\\nT\\n1: r1(X); X :{equal} X − 10; w1(X); r1(Y); Y :{equal} Y + 10; w1(Y);\\nT2: r2(Y); Y :{equal} Y − 20; w2(Y); r2(X); X :{equal} X + 20; w2(X);\\nConsider the following nonserializable schedule Sh for the two transactions:\\nSh: r1(X); w1(X); r2(Y); w2(Y); r1(Y); w1(Y); r2(X); w2(X);\\nWith the additional knowledge, or semantics , that the operations between each \\nri(I) and wi(I) are commutative, we know that the order of executing the \\nsequences consisting of (read, update, write) is not important as long as each (read, update, write) sequence by a particular transaction T\\ni on a particular item \\nI is not interrupted by conflicting operations. Hence, the schedule Sh is consid-\\nered to be correct even though it is not serializable. Researchers have been work-ing on extending concurrency control theory to deal with cases where serializability is considered to be too restrictive as a condition for correctness of schedules. Also, in certain domains of applications, such as computer-aided design (CAD) of complex systems like aircraft, design transactions last over a long time period. In such applications, more relaxed schemes of concurrency control have been proposed to maintain consistency of the database, such as eventual consistency . We shall discuss eventual consistency in the context of dis-\\ntributed databases in Chapter 23.\\n20.6 Transaction Support in SQL\\nIn this section, we give a brief introduction to transaction support in SQL. There are many more details, and the newer standards have more commands for trans-action processing. The basic definition of an SQL transaction is similar to our already defined concept of a transaction. That is, it is a logical unit of work and is guaranteed to be atomic. A single SQL statement is always considered to be atomic—either it completes execution without an error or it fails and leaves the database unchanged.'),\n",

Transaction initiation is \\ndone implicitly when particular SQL statements are encountered. However, every transaction must have an explicit end statement, which is either a \\nCOMMIT  or a \\nROLLBACK . Every transaction has certain characteristics attributed to it. These \\ncharacteristics are specified by a SET TRANSACTION  statement in SQL. The charac-\\nteristics are the access mode , the diagnostic area size , and the isolation level .\\nThe access mode  can be specified as READ ONLY  or READ WRITE . The default is \\nREAD WRITE , unless the isolation level of READ UNCOMMITTED  is specified (see \\nbelow), in which case READ ONLY  is assumed. A mode of READ WRITE  allows select, \\nupdate, insert, delete, and create commands to be executed. A mode of READ ONLY , \\nas the name implies, is simply for data retrieval.\\nThe diagnostic area size  option, DIAGNOSTIC SIZE  n, specifies an integer value n, \\nwhich indicates the number of conditions that can be held simultaneously in the diagnostic area. These conditions supply feedback information (errors or excep-tions) to the user or program on the n most recently executed SQL statement.\\nThe isolation level  option is specified using the statement \\nISOLATION LEVEL <isolation> , \\nwhere the value for < isolation > can be READ UNCOMMITTED , READ COMMITTED , \\nREPEATABLE  READ , or SERIALIZABLE .15 The default isolation level is SERIALIZABLE , \\nalthough some systems use READ COMMITTED  as their default. The use of the term \\nSERIALIZABLE  here is based on not allowing violations that cause dirty read, unre-\\npeatable read, and phantoms,16 and it is thus not identical to the way serializability \\nwas defined earlier in Section 20.5. If a transaction executes at a lower isolation level \\nthan SERIALIZABLE , then one or more of the following three violations may occur:\\n  1. Dirty read.  A transaction T1 may read the update of a transaction T2, which \\nhas not yet committed. If T2 fails and is aborted, then T1 would have read a \\nvalue that does not exist and is incorrect.\\n  2. Nonrepeatable read.  A transaction T1 may read a given value from a table. \\nIf another transaction T2 later updates that value and T1 reads that value \\nagain, T1 will see a different value.\\n  3. Phantoms.  A transaction T1 may read a set of rows from a table, perhaps \\nbased on some condition specified in the SQL WHERE -clause. Now suppose \\nthat a transaction T2 inserts a new row r that also satisfies the WHERE -clause \\ncondition used in T1, into the table used by T1. The record r is called a \\n phantom record  because it was not there when T1 starts but is there when \\nT1 ends. T1 may or may not see the phantom, a row that previously did not \\nexist. If the equivalent serial order is T1 followed by T2, then the record r \\nshould not be seen; but if it is T2 followed by T1,then the phantom record \\nshould be in the result given to T1. If the system cannot ensure the correct \\nbehavior, then it does not deal with the phantom record problem.\\n15These are similar to the isolation levels  discussed briefly at the end of Section 20.3.\\n16The dirty read and unrepeatable read problems were discussed in Section 20.1.3. Phantoms are dis-\\ncussed in Section 22.7 .1.'),\n",

If an error occurs on any of the SQL statements, the entire transaction is rolled back.

Any insertions, deletions, or updates that occur after the transaction starts will not be seen by the transaction. We will discuss a concurrency control protocol based on this concept in Chapter 21.\\n20.7 Summary\\nIn this chapter, we discussed DBMS concepts for transaction processing. We intro-duced the concept of a database transaction and the operations relevant to transac-tion processing in Section 20.1. We compared single-user systems to multiuser systems and then presented examples of how uncontrolled execution of concurrent transactions in a multiuser system can lead to incorrect results and database values in Section 20.1.1. We also discussed the various types of failures that may occur during transaction execution in Section 20.1.4.\\nNext, in Section 20.2, we introduced the typical states that a transaction passes \\nthrough during execution, and discussed several concepts that are used in recovery and concurrency control methods. The system log (Section 20.2.2) keeps track of database accesses, and the system uses this information to recover from failures. A transaction can succeed and reach its commit point, or it can fail and has to be rolled back. A committed transaction (Section 20.2.3) has its changes permanently recorded in the database. In Section 20.3, we presented an overview of the desirable properties of transactions—atomicity, consistency preservation, isolation, and durability—which are often referred to as the ACID properties.\\nThen we defined a schedule (or history) as an execution sequence of the opera-\\ntions of several transactions with interleaving in Section 20.4.1. We character-ized schedules in terms of their recoverability in Section 20.4.2. Recoverable schedules ensure that, once a transaction commits, it never needs to be undone. Cascadeless schedules add an additional condition to ensure that no aborted transaction requires the cascading abort of other transactions. Strict schedules provide an even stronger condition that allows a simple recovery scheme con-sisting of restoring the old values of items that have been changed by an aborted transaction.\\nThen in Section 20.5 we defined the equivalence of schedules and saw that a serial-\\nizable schedule is equivalent to some serial schedule. We defined the concepts of conflict equivalence and view equivalence. A serializable schedule is considered correct. We presented an algorithm for testing the (conflict) serializability of a schedule in Section 20.5.2. We discussed why testing for serializability is impracti-cal in a real system, although it can be used to define and verify concurrency con-trol protocols in Section 20.5.3, and we briefly mentioned less restrictive definitions of schedule equivalence in Sections 20.5.4 and 20.5.5. Finally, in Section 20.6, we gave a brief overview of how transaction concepts are used in practice within SQL, and we introduced the concept of snapshot isolation, which is used in several com-mercial DBMSs.'),\n",

(1975). The concept of the database transaction was first discussed in Gray (1981). Gray won the coveted ACM Turing Award in 1998 for his work on database transactions and implementation of transactions in relational DBMSs. Bernstein, Hadzilacos, and Goodman (1988) focus on concur-rency control and recovery techniques in both centralized and distributed database systems; it is an excellent reference. Papadimitriou (1986) offers a more theoretical perspective. A large reference book of more than a thousand pages by Gray and Reuter (1993) offers a more practical perspective of transaction processing concepts and techniques. Elmagarmid (1992) offers collections of research papers on trans-action processing for advanced applications. Transaction support in SQL is described in Date and Darwen (1997). View serializability is defined in Yannakakis (1984). Recoverability of schedules and reliability in databases is discussed in Hadzilacos (1983, 1988).

Most of these techniques ensure serializability of schedules—which we defined in Sec-tion\\xa021.5—using concurrency control protocols  (sets of rules) that guarantee serializ-\\nability. One important set of protocols—known as two-phase locking protocols — \\nemploys the technique of locking  data items to prevent multiple transactions from \\naccessing the items concurrently; a number of locking protocols are described in Sections 21.1 and 21.3.2. Locking protocols are used in some commercial DBMSs, but they are considered to have high overhead. Another set of concurrency control protocols uses timestamps . A timestamp is a unique identifier for each transaction, \\ngenerated by the system. Timestamp values are generated in the same order as the transaction start times. Concurrency control protocols that use timestamp ordering to ensure serializability are introduced in Section 21.2. In Section 21.3, we discuss multiversion  concurrency control protocols that use multiple versions of a data \\nitem. One multiversion protocol extends timestamp order to multiversion time-stamp ordering (Section 21.3.1), and another extends timestamp order to two-phase locking (Section 21.3.2). In Section 21.4, we present a protocol based on the concept of validation  or certification  of a transaction after it executes its opera-\\ntions; these are sometimes called optimistic protocols , and they also assume that \\nmultiple versions of a data item can exist. In Section 21.4, we discuss a protocol that \\nis based on the concept of snapshot isolation , which can utilize techniques similar \\nto those proposed in validation-based and multiversion methods; these protocols \\nare used in a number of commercial DBMSs and in certain cases are considered to \\nhave lower overhead than locking-based protocols.chapter 21'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 812}, page_content='782 Chapter 21 Concurrency Control Techniques\\nAnother factor that affects concurrency control is the granularity  of the data \\nitems—that is, what portion of the database a data item represents. An item can be as small as a single attribute (field) value or as large as a disk block, or even a whole file or the entire database. We discuss granularity of items and a multiple granular-ity concurrency control protocol, which is an extension of two-phase locking, in Section 21.5. In Section 21.6, we describe concurrency control issues that arise when indexes are used to process transactions, and in Section 21.7 we discuss some additional concurrency control concepts. Section 21.8 summarizes the chapter.\\nIt is sufficient to read Sections 21.1, 21.5, 21.6, and 21.7, and possibly 21.3.2, if your \\nmain interest is an introduction to the concurrency control techniques that are based on locking.\\n21.1  Two-Phase Locking Techniques  \\nfor Concurrency Control\\nSome of the main techniques used to control concurrent execution of transactions \\nare based on the concept of locking data items. A lock  is a variable associated with \\na data item that describes the status of the item with respect to possible operations \\nthat can be applied to it. Generally, there is one lock for each data item in the data-\\nbase. Locks are used as a means of synchronizing the access by concurrent transac-\\ntions to the database items. In Section 21.1.1, we discuss the nature and types of \\nlocks. Then, in Section 21.1.2, we present protocols that use locking to guarantee \\nserializability of transaction schedules. Finally, in Section 21.1.3, we describe two \\nproblems associated with the use of locks—deadlock and starvation—and show how these problems are handled in concurrency control protocols.\\n21.1.1 Types of Locks and System Lock Tables\\nSeveral types of locks are used in concurrency control. To introduce locking con-cepts gradually, first we discuss binary locks, which are simple but are also too \\nrestrictive for database concurrency control purposes  and so are not used much. \\nThen we discuss shared/exclusive  locks—also known as read/write  locks—which \\nprovide more general locking capabilities and are used in database locking schemes. In Section 21.3.2, we describe an additional type of lock called a certify lock , and we \\nshow how it can be used to improve performance of locking protocols.\\nBinary Locks. A binary lock  can have two states  or values : locked and unlocked \\n(or 1 and 0, for simplicity). A distinct lock is associated with each database item X. \\nIf the value of the lock on X is 1, item X cannot be accessed  by a database operation \\nthat requests the item. If the value of the lock on X is 0, the item can be accessed \\nwhen requested, and the lock value is changed to 1. We refer to the current value (or state) of the lock associated with item X as lock( X).\\nTwo operations, \\nlock_item  and unlock_item , are used with binary locking. A trans-\\naction requests access to an item X by first issuing a lock_item( X) operation. If'),\n",

If LOCK (X) = 0, it is set to 1 (the \\ntransaction locks  the item) and the transaction is allowed to access item X. When \\nthe transaction is through using the item, it issues an unlock_item( X) operation, \\nwhich sets LOCK (X) back to 0 ( unlocks  the item) so that X may be accessed by \\nother transactions. Hence, a binary lock enforces mutual exclusion  on the data \\nitem. A description of the lock_item (X) and unlock_item (X) operations is shown in \\nFigure 21.1.\\nNotice that the lock_item  and unlock_item  operations must be implemented as indi-\\nvisible units (known as critical sections  in operating systems); that is, no interleav-\\ning should be allowed once a lock or unlock operation is started until the operation terminates or the transaction waits. In Figure 21.1, the wait command within the \\nlock_item (X) operation is usually implemented by putting the transaction in a wait-\\ning queue for item X until X is unlocked and the transaction can be granted access \\nto it. Other transactions that also want to access X are placed in the same queue. \\nHence, the wait command is considered to be outside the lock_item  operation.\\nIt is simple to implement a binary lock; all that is needed is a binary-valued variable, \\nLOCK , associated with each data item X in the database. In its simplest form, each \\nlock can be a record with three fields: < Data_item_name , LOCK , Locking_transaction > \\nplus a queue for transactions that are waiting to access the item. The system needs to maintain only these records for the items that are currently locked  in a lock table , \\nwhich could be organized as a hash file on the item name. Items not in the lock \\ntable are considered to be unlocked. The DBMS has a lock manager subsystem  to \\nkeep track of and control access to locks.\\nIf the simple binary locking scheme described here is used, every transaction must \\nobey the following rules:\\n  1. A transaction T must issue the operation lock_item (X) before any  \\nread_item (X) or write_item (X) operations are performed in T.\\n  2. A transaction T must issue the operation unlock_item (X) after all read_item (X) \\nand write_item (X) operations are completed in T.lock_item( X):\\nB: if LOCK( X) = 0 (*item is unlocked*)\\n  then LOCK( X) ←1 (*lock the item*)\\n else\\n  begin\\n  wait (until LOCK( X) = 0\\n   and the lock manager wakes up the transaction);\\n  go to B\\n  end;\\nunlock_item( X):\\n LOCK( X) ← 0; (* unlock the item *)\\n if any transactions are waiting\\n  then wakeup one of the waiting transactions;Figure 21.1 \\nLock and unlock operations for binary locks.'),\n",

A transaction T will not issue a lock_item (X) operation if it already holds the \\nlock on item X.1\\n  4. A transaction T will not issue an unlock_item( X) operation unless it already \\nholds the lock on item X.\\nThese rules can be enforced by the lock manager module of the DBMS. Between the \\nlock_item (X) and unlock_item (X) operations in transaction T, T is said to hold the \\nlock  on item X. At most one transaction can hold the lock on a particular item. \\nThus no two transactions can access the same item concurrently.\\nShared/Exclusive (or Read/Write) Locks. The preceding binary locking \\nscheme is too restrictive for database items because at most one transaction can hold a lock on a given item. We should allow several transactions to access the same item X if they all access X for reading purposes only . This is because read \\noperations on the same item by different transactions are not conflicting  (see Sec-\\ntion 21.4.1). However, if a transaction is to write an item X, it must have exclusive \\naccess to X. For this purpose, a different type of lock, called a multiple-mode \\nlock , is used. In this scheme—called shared/exclusive  or read/write  locks—there \\nare three locking operations: \\nread_lock (X), write_lock (X), and unlock (X). A lock \\nassociated with an item X, LOCK (X), now has three possible states: read-locked , \\nwrite-locked , or unlocked . A read-locked item  is also called share-locked  because \\nother transactions are allowed to read the item, whereas a write-locked item  is \\ncalled exclusive-locked  because a single transaction exclusively holds the lock on \\nthe item.\\nOne method for implementing the preceding operations on a read/write lock is \\nto keep track of the number of transactions that hold a shared (read) lock on an \\nitem in the lock table, as well as a list of transaction ids that hold a shared lock. Each record in the lock table will have four fields: <\\nData_item_name , LOCK ,  \\nNo_of_reads , Locking_transaction(s) >. The system needs to maintain lock records \\nonly for locked items in the lock table. The value (state) of LOCK  is either read-\\nlocked or write-locked, suitably coded (if we assume no records are kept in \\nthe\\xa0lock table for unlocked items). If LOCK (X) = write-locked, the value of \\n locking_transaction(s) is a single transaction  that holds the exclusive (write) lock \\non X. If LOCK (X)=read-locked, the value of locking transaction(s) is a list of one \\nor more transactions that hold the shared (read) lock on X. The three operations \\nread_lock (X), write_lock (X), and unlock (X) are described in Figure 21.2.2 As before, \\neach of the three locking operations should be considered indivisible; no inter-\\nleaving should be allowed once one of the operations is started until either the \\noperation terminates by granting the lock or the transaction is placed in a wait-\\ning queue for the item.\\n1This rule may be removed if we modify the lock_item ( X) operation in Figure 21.1 so that if the item is \\ncurrently locked by the requesting transaction , the lock is granted.\\n2These algorithms do not allow upgrading  or downgrading  of locks, as described later in this section. The \\nreader can extend the algorithms to allow these additional operations.'),\n",

It is desirable to relax con-\\nditions 4 and 5 in the preceding list in order to allow lock conversion ; that is, a \\ntransaction that already holds a lock on item X is allowed under certain conditions \\nto convert  the lock from one locked state to another. For example, it is possible for \\na transaction T to issue a read_lock (X) and then later to upgrade  the lock by issuing \\na write_lock (X) operation. If T is the only transaction holding a read lock on X at the \\ntime it issues the write_lock (X) operation, the lock can be upgraded; otherwise, the \\ntransaction must wait. It is also possible for a transaction T to issue a write_lock (X) \\nand then later to downgrade  the lock by issuing a read_lock (X) operation. When \\nupgrading and downgrading of locks is used, the lock table must include transac-\\ntion identifiers in the record structure for each lock (in the locking_transaction(s) \\nfield) to store the information on which transactions hold locks on the item. The \\ndescriptions of the read_lock (X) and write_lock (X) operations in Figure 21.2 must be \\nchanged appropriately to allow for lock upgrading and downgrading. We leave this \\nas an exercise for the reader.\\nUsing binary locks or read/write locks in transactions, as described earlier, does not \\nguarantee serializability of schedules on its own. Figure 21.3 shows an example \\nwhere the preceding locking rules are followed but a nonserializable schedule may \\nresult. This is because in Figure 21.3(a) the items Y in T1 and X in T2 were unlocked \\ntoo early. This allows a schedule such as the one shown in Figure 21.3(c) to occur, \\nwhich is not a serializable schedule and hence gives incorrect results. To guarantee \\nserializability, we must follow an additional protocol  concerning the positioning of \\nlocking and unlocking operations in every transaction. The best-known protocol, two-phase locking, is described in the next section.\\n21.1.2 Guaranteeing Serializability by Two-Phase Locking\\nA transaction is said to follow the two-phase locking protocol  if all locking opera-\\ntions ( read_lock , write_lock ) precede the first unlock operation in the transaction.4 \\nSuch a transaction can be divided into two phases: an expanding  or growing \\n(first) phase , during which new locks on items can be acquired but none can be \\nreleased; and a shrinking (second) phase , during which existing locks can be \\nreleased but no new locks can be acquired.

Now, the schedule shown in Figure 21.3(c) is not permitted for T\\n1′ and T2′ (with their modified order of locking and unlocking operations) \\nunder the rules of locking described in Section 21.1.1 because T1′ will issue its  \\nwrite_lock (X) before  it unlocks item Y; consequently, when T2′ issues its read_lock (X), \\nit is forced to wait until T1′ releases the lock by issuing an unlock  (X) in the schedule. \\nHowever, this can lead to deadlock (see Section 21.1.3).(a) T1Initial values: X=20, Y=30\\nResult serial schedule T1\\nfollowed by T2: X=50, Y=80\\nResult of serial schedule T2\\nfollowed by T1: X=70, Y=50read_lock( Y);\\nread_item( Y);\\nunlock( Y);\\nwrite_lock( X);\\nread_item( X);\\nX := X + Y;\\nwrite_item( X);\\nunlock( X);\\nwrite_lock( X);\\nread_item( X);\\nX := X + Y;\\nwrite_item( X);\\nunlock( X);read_lock( X);\\nread_item( X);\\nunlock( X);\\nwrite_lock( Y);\\nread_item( Y);\\nY := X + Y;\\nwrite_item( Y);\\nunlock( Y);\\nread_lock( X);\\nread_item( X);\\nunlock( X);\\nwrite_lock( Y);\\nread_item( Y);\\nY := X + Y;\\nwrite_item( Y);\\nunlock( Y);(b)\\n(c)\\nTimeread_lock( Y);\\nread_item( Y);\\nunlock( Y);\\nResult of schedule S:\\nX=50, Y=50\\n(nonserializable)T2\\nT1 T2\\nFigure 21.3 \\nTransactions that do not obey two-phase locking.

The locking protocol, by enforcing two-phase lock-ing rules, also enforces serializability.\\nTwo-phase locking may limit the amount of concurrency that can occur in a sched-\\nule because a transaction T may not be able to release an item X after it is through \\nusing it if T must lock an additional item Y later; or, conversely, T must lock the \\nadditional item Y before it needs it so that it can release X. Hence, X must remain \\nlocked by T until all items that the transaction needs to read or write have been \\nlocked; only then can X be released by T. Meanwhile, another transaction seeking to \\naccess X may be forced to wait, even though T is done with X; conversely, if Y is \\nlocked earlier than it is needed, another transaction seeking to access Y is forced to \\nwait even though T is not using Y yet. This is the price for guaranteeing serializabil-\\nity of all schedules without having to check the schedules themselves.\\nAlthough the two-phase locking protocol guarantees serializability (that is, every \\nschedule that is permitted is serializable), it does not permit all possible  serializable \\nschedules (that is, some serializable schedules will be prohibited by the protocol).\\nBasic, Conservative, Strict, and Rigorous Two-Phase Locking. There are a \\nnumber of variations of two-phase locking (2PL). The technique just described is \\nknown as basic 2PL . A variation known as conservative 2PL  (or static 2PL ) \\nrequires a transaction to lock all the items it accesses before the transaction begins \\nexecution , by predeclaring  its read-set  and write-set . Recall from Section 21.1.2 that \\nthe read-set  of a transaction is the set of all items that the transaction reads, and the \\nwrite-set  is the set of all items that it writes. If any of the predeclared items needed \\ncannot be locked, the transaction does not lock any item; instead, it waits until all the items are available for locking. Conservative 2PL is a deadlock-free protocol , as \\nwe will see in Section 21.1.3 when we discuss the deadlock problem. However, it is difficult to use in practice because of the need to predeclare the read-set and write-set, which is not possible in some situations.\\nIn practice, the most popular variation of 2PL is strict 2PL , which guarantees strict \\nschedules (see Section 21.4).

A more restrictive variation of strict 2PL is rigorous 2PL , which also guarantees strict \\nschedules. In this variation, a transaction T does not release any of its locks (exclu-\\nsive or shared) until after it commits or aborts, and so it is easier to implement than strict 2PL.\\nNotice the difference between strict and rigorous 2PL: the former holds write-locks \\nuntil it commits, whereas the latter holds all locks (read and write). Also, the differ-ence between conservative and rigorous 2PL is that the former must lock all its items before it starts , so once the transaction starts it is in its shrinking phase; the \\nlatter does not unlock any of its items until after it terminates  (by committing or \\naborting), so the transaction is in its expanding phase until it ends.\\nUsually the concurrency control subsystem  itself is responsible for generating \\nthe\\xa0\\nread_lock  and write_lock  requests. For example, suppose the system is to enforce \\nthe strict 2PL protocol. Then, whenever transaction T issues a read_item (X), the \\n system calls the read_lock (X) operation on behalf of T. If the state of LOCK (X) is \\nwrite_locked by some other transaction T′, the system places T in the waiting queue \\nfor item X; otherwise, it grants the read_lock (X) request and permits the read_item (X) \\noperation of T to execute. On the other hand, if transaction T issues a write_item (X), \\nthe system calls the write_lock (X) operation on behalf of T. If the state of LOCK (X) is \\nwrite_locked or read_locked by some other transaction T′, the system places T in \\nthe waiting queue for item X; if the state of LOCK (X) is read_locked and T itself is \\nthe only transaction holding the read lock on X, the system upgrades the lock to \\nwrite_locked and permits the write_item (X) operation by T. Finally, if the state of \\nLOCK (X) is unlocked, the system grants the write_lock (X) request and permits the \\nwrite_item( X) operation to execute. After each action, the system must update its \\nlock table  appropriately.\\nLocking is generally considered to have a high overhead, because every read or \\nwrite operation is preceded by a system locking request. The use of locks can also \\ncause two additional problems: deadlock and starvation. We discuss these problems \\nand their solutions in the next section.\\n21.1.3 Dealing with Deadlock and Starvation\\nDeadlock  occurs when each  transaction T in a set of two or more transactions  is \\nwaiting for some item that is locked by some other transaction T′ in the set. Hence, \\neach transaction in the set is in a waiting queue, waiting for one of the other trans-actions in the set to release the lock on an item. But because the other transaction is also waiting, it will never release the lock. A simple example is shown in Fig-ure\\xa021.5(a), where the two transactions T\\n1′ and T2′ are deadlocked in a partial \\nschedule; T1′ is in the waiting queue for X, which is locked by T2′, whereas T2′ is in \\nthe waiting queue for Y, which is locked by T1′. Meanwhile, neither T1′ nor T2′ nor \\nany other transaction can access items X and Y.'),\n",

One way to prevent deadlock is to use a deadlock \\nprevention protocol .5 One deadlock prevention protocol, which is used in conserva-\\ntive two-phase locking, requires that every transaction lock all the items it needs in \\nadvance  (which is generally not a practical assumption)—if any of the items cannot be \\nobtained, none of the items are locked. Rather, the transaction waits and then tries again to lock all the items it needs. Obviously, this solution further limits concurrency. A second protocol, which also limits concurrency, involves ordering all the items  in the \\ndatabase and making sure that a transaction that needs several items will lock them \\naccording to that order. This requires that the programmer (or the system) is aware of the chosen order of the items, which is also not practical in the database context.\\nA number of other deadlock prevention schemes have been proposed that make a \\ndecision about what to do with a transaction involved in a possible deadlock situation: Should it be blocked and made to wait or should it be aborted, or should the transac-tion preempt and abort another transaction? Some of these techniques use the concept \\nof transaction timestamp  \\nTS(T′), which is a unique identifier assigned to each trans-\\naction. The timestamps are typically based on the order in which transactions are started; hence, if transaction T\\n1 starts before transaction T2, then TS(T1) < TS(T2). \\nNotice that the older  transaction (which starts first) has the smaller  timestamp value. \\nTwo schemes that prevent deadlock are called wait-die  and wound-wait . Suppose that \\ntransaction Ti tries to lock an item X but is not able to because X is locked by some \\nother transaction Tj with a conflicting lock. The rules followed by these schemes are:\\n ■Wait-die.  If TS(Ti) < TS(Tj), then ( Ti older than Tj) Ti is allowed to wait; \\notherwise ( Ti younger than Tj) abort Ti (Ti dies ) and restart it later with the \\nsame timestamp.\\n ■Wound-wait.  If TS(Ti) < TS(Tj), then ( Ti older than Tj) abort Tj (Ti wounds \\nTj) and restart it later with the same timestamp;  otherwise ( Ti younger than \\nTj) Ti is allowed to wait.(a) T1/H11032 (b)\\nread_lock( Y);\\nread_item( Y);\\nTime\\nwrite_lock( X);read_lock( X);\\nread_item( X);\\nwrite_lock( Y);T2/H11032\\n   T2/H11032 T1/H11032X\\nY\\nFigure 21.5 \\nIllustrating the deadlock problem.

The wound-wait approach does the opposite: A younger transaction is allowed to wait for an older one , whereas an older transaction requesting an item held \\nby a younger transaction preempts  the younger transaction by aborting it. Both \\nschemes end up aborting the younger  of the two transactions (the transaction that \\nstarted later) that may be involved  in a deadlock, assuming that this will waste less \\nprocessing. It can be shown that these two techniques are deadlock-free , since in wait-\\ndie, transactions only wait for younger transactions so no cycle is created. Similarly, in wound-wait, transactions only wait for older transactions so no cycle is created. How-ever, both techniques may cause some transactions to be aborted and restarted need-lessly, even though those transactions may never actually cause a deadlock .\\nAnother group of protocols that prevent deadlock do not require timestamps. \\nThese include the no waiting (NW) and cautious waiting (CW) algorithms. In the no waiting algorithm , if a transaction is unable to obtain a lock, it is immediately \\naborted and then restarted after a certain time delay without checking whether a deadlock will actually occur or not. In this case, no transaction ever waits, so no deadlock will occur. However, this scheme can cause transactions to abort and restart needlessly. The cautious waiting  algorithm was proposed to try to reduce \\nthe number of needless aborts/restarts. Suppose that transaction T\\ni tries to lock an \\nitem X but is not able to do so because X is locked by some other transaction Tj with \\na conflicting lock. The cautious waiting rule is as follows:\\n ■Cautious waiting.  If Tj is not blocked (not waiting for some other locked \\nitem), then Ti is blocked and allowed to wait; otherwise abort Ti.\\nIt can be shown that cautious waiting is deadlock-free, because no transaction will \\never wait for another blocked transaction. By considering the time b(T) at which \\neach blocked transaction T was blocked, if the two transactions Ti and Tj above both \\nbecome blocked and Ti is waiting for Tj, then b(Ti) < b(Tj), since Ti can only wait for \\nTj at a time when Tj is not blocked itself. Hence, the blocking times form a total \\nordering on all blocked transactions, so no cycle that causes deadlock can occur.\\nDeadlock Detection. An alternative approach to dealing with deadlock is \\n deadlock detection , where the system checks if a state of deadlock actually exists. \\nThis solution is attractive if we know there will be little interference among the transactions—that is, if different transactions will rarely access the same items at the same time. This can happen if the transactions are short and each transaction locks only a few items, or if the transaction load is light. On the other hand, if trans-actions are long and each transaction uses many items, or if the transaction load is heavy, it may be advantageous to use a deadlock prevention scheme.\\nA simple way to detect a state of deadlock is for the system to construct and main-\\ntain a wait-for graph . One node is created in the wait-for graph for each transac-\\ntion that is currently executing. Whenever a transaction T\\ni is waiting to lock an \\nitem X that is currently locked by a transaction Tj, a directed edge ( Ti → Tj) is cre-\\nated in the wait-for graph. When Tj releases the lock(s) on the items that Ti was'),\n",

We have a state of \\ndeadlock if and only if the wait-for graph has a cycle. One problem with this approach is the matter of determining when  the system should check for a dead-\\nlock. One possibility is to check for a cycle every time an edge is added to the wait-for graph, but this may cause excessive overhead. Criteria such as the number of currently executing transactions or the period of time several transactions have been waiting to lock items may be used instead to check for a cycle. Figure 21.5(b) shows the wait-for graph for the (partial) schedule shown in Figure 21.5(a).\\nIf the system is in a state of deadlock, some of the transactions causing the deadlock \\nmust be aborted. Choosing which transactions to abort is known as victim \\n selection . The algorithm for victim selection should generally avoid selecting trans-\\nactions that have been running for a long time and that have performed many \\nupdates, and it should try instead to select transactions that have not made many \\nchanges (younger transactions).\\nTimeouts. Another simple scheme to deal with deadlock is the use of timeouts . \\nThis method is practical because of its low overhead and simplicity. In this method, if a transaction waits for a period longer than a system-defined timeout period, the system assumes that the transaction may be deadlocked and aborts it—regardless of whether a deadlock actually exists.\\nStarvation. Another problem that may occur when we use locking is starvation , \\nwhich occurs when a transaction cannot proceed for an indefinite period of time while other transactions in the system continue normally. This may occur if the waiting scheme for locked items is unfair in that it gives priority to some transac-tions over others. One solution for starvation is to have a fair waiting scheme, such as using a first-come-first-served  queue; transactions are enabled to lock an item \\nin the order in which they originally requested the lock. Another scheme allows some transactions to have priority over others but increases the priority of a trans-action the longer it waits, until it eventually gets the highest priority and proceeds. Starvation can also occur because of victim selection if the algorithm selects the same transaction as victim repeatedly, thus causing it to abort and never finish exe-cution. The algorithm can use higher priorities for transactions that have been aborted multiple times to avoid this problem. The wait-die and wound-wait \\nschemes discussed previously avoid starvation, because they restart a transaction that has been aborted with its same original timestamp, so the possibility that the same transaction is aborted repeatedly is slim.\\n21.2  Concurrency Control Based  \\non Timestamp Ordering\\nThe use of locking, combined with the 2PL protocol, guarantees serializability of \\nschedules. The serializable schedules produced by 2PL have their equivalent serial \\nschedules based on the order in which executing transactions lock the items they \\nacquire. If a transaction needs an item that is already locked, it may be forced to \\nwait until the item is released. Some transactions may be aborted and restarted'),\n",

A different approach to concurrency control \\ninvolves using transaction timestamps to order transaction execution for an equiv-alent serial schedule. In Section 21.2.1, we discuss timestamps; and in Section 21.2.2, we discuss how serializability is enforced by ordering conflicting operations in dif-ferent transactions based on the transaction timestamps.\\n21.2.1 Timestamps\\nRecall that a timestamp  is a unique identifier created by the DBMS to identify a \\ntransaction. Typically, timestamp values are assigned in the order in which the transactions are submitted to the system, so a timestamp can be thought of as the transaction start time . We will refer to the timestamp of transaction T as TS(T). \\nConcurrency control techniques based on timestamp ordering do not use locks; hence, deadlocks cannot occur .\\nTimestamps can be generated in several ways. One possibility is to use a counter that \\nis incremented each time its value is assigned to a transaction. The transaction time-stamps are numbered 1, 2, 3, … in this scheme. A computer counter has a finite maximum value, so the system must periodically reset the counter to zero when no transactions are executing for some short period of time. Another way to implement timestamps is to use the current date/time value of the system clock and ensure that \\nno two timestamp values are generated during the same tick of the clock.\\n21.2.2  The Timestamp Ordering Algorithm  \\nfor Concurrency Control\\nThe idea for this scheme is to enforce the equivalent serial order on the transac-\\ntions based on their timestamps. A schedule in which the transactions participate \\nis then serializable, and the only equivalent serial schedule permitted  has the trans-\\nactions in order of their timestamp values. This is called timestamp ordering \\n(TO) . Notice how this differs from 2PL, where a schedule is serializable by being \\nequivalent to some serial schedule allowed by the locking protocols. In timestamp ordering, however, the schedule is equivalent to the particular serial order  corre-\\nsponding to the order of the transaction timestamps. The algorithm allows inter-leaving of transaction operations, but it must ensure that for each pair of conflicting \\noperations  in the schedule, the order in which the item is accessed must follow the \\ntimestamp order. To do this, the algorithm associates with each database item X \\ntwo timestamp (TS) values:\\n  1. read_TS( X). The read timestamp  of item X is the largest timestamp \\namong all the timestamps of transactions that have successfully read item \\nX—that is, read_TS (X) = TS(T), where T is the youngest  transaction that \\nhas read X successfully.\\n  2. write_TS( X). The write timestamp  of item X is the largest of all the time-\\nstamps of transactions that have successfully written item X—that is, \\nwrite_TS (X) = TS(T), where T is the youngest  transaction that has written \\nX successfully. Based on the algorithm, T will also be the last transaction \\nto write item X, as we shall see.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 824}, page_content='794 Chapter 21 Concurrency Control Techniques\\nBasic Timestamp Ordering (TO). Whenever some transaction T tries to issue a \\nread_item (X) or a write_item (X) operation, the basic TO  algorithm compares the \\ntimestamp of T with read_TS (X) and write_TS (X) to ensure that the timestamp order \\nof transaction execution is not violated. If this order is violated, then transaction T \\nis aborted and resubmitted to the system as a new transaction with a new time-\\nstamp . If T is aborted and rolled back, any transaction T1 that may have used a value \\nwritten by T must also be rolled back. Similarly, any transaction T2 that may have \\nused a value written by T1 must also be rolled back, and so on. This effect is known \\nas cascading rollback  and is one of the problems associated with basic TO, since \\nthe schedules produced are not guaranteed to be recoverable. An additional proto-\\ncol must be enforced to ensure that the schedules are recoverable, cascadeless, or \\nstrict. We first describe the basic TO algorithm here. The concurrency control algo-rithm must check whether conflicting operations violate the timestamp ordering in the following two cases:\\n  1. Whenever a transaction T issues a write_item (X) operation, the following \\ncheck is performed:\\na. If read_TS (X) > TS(T) or if write_TS (X) > TS(T), then abort and roll back T \\nand reject the operation. This should be done because some younger  trans-\\naction with a timestamp greater than TS(T)—and hence after T  in the \\ntimestamp ordering—has already read or written the value of item X \\nbefore T had a chance to write X, thus violating the timestamp ordering.\\nb. If the condition in part (a) does not occur, then execute the write_item (X) \\noperation of T and set write_TS (X) to TS(T).\\n  2. Whenever a transaction T issues a read_item (X) operation, the following \\ncheck is performed:\\na. If write_TS (X) > TS(T), then abort and roll back T and reject the operation. \\nThis should be done because some younger transaction with timestamp greater than \\nTS(T)—and hence after T  in the timestamp ordering—has \\nalready written the value of item X before T had a chance to read X.\\nb. If write_TS (X) ≤ TS(T), then execute the read_item (X) operation of T and \\nset read_TS (X) to the larger  of TS(T) and the current read_TS (X).\\nWhenever the basic TO algorithm detects two conflicting operations  that occur in \\nthe incorrect order, it rejects the later of the two operations by aborting the transac-tion that issued it. The schedules produced by basic TO are hence guaranteed to be conflict serializable . As mentioned earlier, deadlock does not occur with timestamp \\nordering. However, cyclic restart (and hence starvation) may occur if a transaction is continually aborted and restarted.\\nStrict Timestamp Ordering (TO). A variation of basic TO called strict TO  ensures \\nthat the schedules are both strict  (for easy recoverability) and (conflict) serializable. \\nIn this variation, a transaction T issues a \\nread_item (X) or write_item (X) such that  \\nTS(T) > write_TS (X) has its read or write operation delayed  until the transaction T′ \\nthat wrote  the value of X (hence TS(T′) = write_TS (X)) has committed or aborted.'),\n",

This \\n algorithm does not cause deadlock , since T waits for T′ only if TS(T) > TS(T′).\\nThomas’s Write Rule. A modification of the basic TO algorithm, known as \\nThomas’s write rule , does not enforce conflict serializability, but it rejects fewer \\nwrite operations by modifying the checks for the write_item (X) operation as follows:\\n  1. If read_TS (X) > TS(T), then abort and roll back T and reject the operation.\\n  2. If write_TS (X) > TS(T), then do not execute the write operation but continue \\nprocessing. This is because some transaction with timestamp greater than \\nTS(T)—and hence after T in the timestamp ordering—has already written \\nthe value of X. Thus, we must ignore the write_item (X) operation of T because \\nit is already outdated and obsolete. Notice that any conflict arising from this situation would be detected by case (1).\\n  3. If neither the condition in part (1) nor the condition in part (2) occurs, then execute the \\nwrite_item (X) operation of T and set write_TS (X) to TS(T).\\n21.3  Multiversion Concurrency  \\nControl Techniques\\nThese protocols for concurrency control keep copies of the old values of a data item \\nwhen the item is updated (written); they are known as multiversion concurrency \\ncontrol  because several versions (values) of an item are kept by the system. When a \\ntransaction requests to read an item, the appropriate  version is chosen to maintain \\nthe serializability of the currently executing schedule. One reason for keeping mul-tiple versions is that some read operations that would be rejected in other tech-niques can still be accepted by reading an older version  of the item to maintain \\nserializability. When a transaction writes an item, it writes a new version  and the old \\nversion(s) of the item is retained. Some multiversion concurrency control algo-\\nrithms use the concept of view serializability rather than conflict serializability.\\nAn obvious drawback of multiversion techniques is that more storage is needed to \\nmaintain multiple versions of the database items. In some cases, older versions can be kept in a temporary store. It is also possible that older versions may have to be maintained anyway—for example, for recovery purposes. Some database applica-tions may require older versions to be kept to maintain a history of the changes of data item values. The extreme case is a temporal database  (see Section 26.2), which \\nkeeps track of all changes and the times at which they occurred. In such cases, there is no additional storage penalty for multiversion techniques, since older versions are already maintained.\\nSeveral multiversion concurrency control schemes have been proposed. We dis-\\ncuss two schemes here, one based on timestamp ordering and the other based on 2PL. In addition, the validation concurrency control method (see Section 21.4) also maintains multiple versions, and the snapshot isolation  technique used in'),\n",

The read timestamp  of Xi is the largest of all the timestamps \\nof transactions that have successfully read version Xi.\\n  2. write_TS( Xi). The write timestamp  of Xi is the timestamp of the transac-\\ntion that wrote the value of version Xi.\\nWhenever a transaction T is allowed to execute a write_item (X) operation, a new ver-\\nsion Xk+1 of item X is created, with both the write_TS (Xk+1) and the read_TS (Xk+1) set to \\nTS(T). Correspondingly, when a transaction T is allowed to read the value of version \\nXi, the value of read_TS (Xi) is set to the larger of the current read_TS (Xi) and TS(T).\\nTo ensure serializability, the following rules are used:\\n  1. If transaction T issues a write_item (X) operation, and version i of X has the \\nhighest write_TS (Xi) of all versions of X that is also less than or equal to  TS(T), \\nand read_TS (Xi) > TS(T), then abort and roll back transaction T; otherwise, \\ncreate a new version Xj of X with read_TS (Xj) = write_TS (Xj) = TS(T).\\n  2. If transaction T issues a read_item (X) operation, find the version i of X that \\nhas the highest write_TS (Xi) of all versions of X that is also less than or equal \\nto TS(T); then return the value of Xi to transaction T, and set the value of \\nread_TS (Xi) to the larger of TS(T) and the current read_TS (Xi).\\nAs we can see in case 2, a read_item (X) is always successful , since it finds the appro-\\npriate version Xi to read based on the write_TS  of the various existing versions of X. \\nIn case 1, however, transaction T may be aborted and rolled back. This happens if T \\nattempts to write a version of X that should have been read by another transaction \\nT′ whose timestamp is read_TS (Xi); however, T′ has already read version Xi, which \\nwas written by the transaction with timestamp equal to write_TS (Xi). If this conflict \\noccurs, T is rolled back; otherwise, a new version of X, written by transaction T, is \\ncreated. Notice that if T is rolled back, cascading rollback may occur. Hence, to \\nensure recoverability, a transaction T should not be allowed to commit until after \\nall the transactions that have written some version that T has read have committed.\\n21.3.2 Multiversion Two-Phase Locking Using Certify Locks\\nIn this multiple-mode locking scheme, there are three locking modes  for an item—\\nread, write, and certify —instead of just the two modes (read, write) discussed previ-\\nously. Hence, the state of LOCK (X) for an item X can be one of read-locked, \\nwrite-locked, certify-locked, or unlocked. In the standard locking scheme, with \\nonly read and write locks (see Section 21.1.1), a write lock is an exclusive lock. We \\ncan describe the relationship between read and write locks in the standard scheme'),\n",

An entry of Yes \\nmeans that if a transaction T holds the type of lock specified in the column header \\non item X and if transaction T′ requests the type of lock specified in the row header \\non the same item X, then T′ can obtain the lock  because the locking modes are com-\\npatible. On the other hand, an entry of No in the table indicates that the locks are \\nnot compatible, so T′ must wait  until T releases  the lock.\\nIn the standard locking scheme, once a transaction obtains a write lock on an item, \\nno other transactions can access that item. The idea behind multiversion 2PL is to allow other transactions T′ to read an item X while a single transaction T holds a \\nwrite lock on X. This is accomplished by allowing two versions  for each item X; one \\nversion, the committed version , must always have been written by some commit-\\nted transaction. The second local version  X′ can be created when a transaction T \\nacquires a write lock on X. Other transactions can continue to read the committed \\nversion  of X while T holds the write lock. Transaction T can write the value of X′ as \\nneeded, without affecting the value of the committed version X. However, once T is \\nready to commit, it must obtain a certify lock  on all items that it currently holds \\nwrite locks on before it can commit; this is another form of lock upgrading . The \\ncertify lock is not compatible with read locks, so the transaction may have to delay its commit until all its write-locked items are released by any reading transactions in order to obtain the certify locks. Once the certify locks—which are exclusive locks—are acquired, the committed version X of the data item is set to the value of \\nversion X′, version X′ is discarded, and the certify locks are then released. The lock \\ncompatibility table for this scheme is shown in Figure 21.6(b).\\nIn this multiversion 2PL scheme, reads can proceed concurrently with a single write \\noperation—an arrangement not permitted under the standard 2PL schemes. The cost is that a transaction may have to delay its commit until it obtains exclusive certify locks on all the items  it has updated. It can be shown that this scheme avoids \\ncascading aborts, since transactions are only allowed to read the version X that was \\nwritten by a committed transaction.

For example, in \\nlocking, a check is done to determine whether the item being accessed is locked. In timestamp ordering, the transaction timestamp is checked against the read and write timestamps of the item. Such checking represents overhead during transac-tion execution, with the effect of slowing down the transactions.\\nIn optimistic concurrency control techniques , also known as validation  or \\n certification techniques , no checking  is done while the transaction is executing. \\nSeveral concurrency control methods are based on the validation technique. We will describe only one scheme in Section 21.4.1. Then, in Section 21.4.2, we discuss concurrency control techniques that are based on the concept of snapshot  isolation . \\nThe implementations of these concurrency control methods can utilize a combina-tion of the concepts from validation-based techniques and versioning techniques, as well as utilizing timestamps. Some of these methods may suffer from anomalies \\nthat can violate serializability, but because they generally have lower overhead than \\n2PL, they have been implemented in several relational DBMSs.\\n21.4.1 Validation-Based (Optimistic) Concurrency Control\\nIn this scheme, updates in the transaction are not applied directly to the database \\nitems on disk until the transaction reaches its end and is validated . During transac-\\ntion execution, all updates are applied to local copies  of the data items that are \\nkept for the transaction.6 At the end of transaction execution, a validation phase  \\nchecks whether any of the transaction’s updates violate serializability. Certain information needed by the validation phase must be kept by the system. If serializ-ability is not violated, the transaction is committed and the database is updated from the local copies; otherwise, the transaction is aborted and then restarted later.\\nThere are three phases for this concurrency control protocol:\\n  1. Read phase.  A transaction can read values of committed data items from the \\ndatabase. However, updates are applied only to local copies (versions) of the data items kept in the transaction workspace.\\n  2. Validation phase.  Checking is performed to ensure that serializability will \\nnot be violated if the transaction updates are applied to the database.\\n  3. Write phase.  If the validation phase is successful, the transaction updates \\nare applied to the database; otherwise, the updates are discarded and the transaction is restarted.\\nThe idea behind optimistic concurrency control is to do all the checks at once; hence, \\ntransaction execution proceeds with a minimum of overhead until the validation \\n6Note that this can be considered as keeping multiple versions of items!'),\n",

If there is little interference among transactions, most will be vali-\\ndated successfully. However, if there is much interference, many transactions that execute to completion will have their results discarded and must be restarted later; under such circumstances, optimistic techniques do not work well. The techniques are called optimistic  because they assume that little interference will occur and hence \\nmost transaction will be validated successfully, so that there is no need to do check-ing during transaction execution. This assumption is generally true in many transac-tion processing workloads.\\nThe optimistic protocol we describe uses transaction timestamps and also requires \\nthat the \\nwrite_sets  and read_sets  of the transactions be kept by the system. Addition-\\nally, start  and end times for the three phases need to be kept for each transaction. \\nRecall that the write_set  of a transaction is the set of items it writes, and the read_set  \\nis the set of items it reads. In the validation phase for transaction Ti, the protocol \\nchecks that Ti does not interfere with any recently committed transactions or with \\nany other concurrent transactions that have started their validation phase. The vali-dation phase for T\\ni checks that, for each  such transaction Tj that is either recently \\ncommitted or is in its validation phase, one of the following conditions holds:\\n  1. Transaction Tj completes its write phase before Ti starts its read phase.\\n  2. Ti starts its write phase after Tj completes its write phase, and the read_set  of \\nTi has no items in common with the write_set  of Tj.\\n  3. Both the read_set  and write_set  of Ti have no items in common with the \\nwrite_set  of Tj, and Tj completes its read phase before Ti completes its \\nread phase.\\nWhen validating transaction Ti against each one of the transactions Tj, the first \\n condition is checked first since (1) is the simplest condition to check. Only if \\ncondi tion 1 is false is condition 2 checked, and only if (2) is false is condition 3—the \\nmost complex to evaluate—checked. If any one of these three conditions holds with each transaction T\\nj, there is no interference and Ti is validated successfully. If none  \\nof these three conditions holds for any one Tj, the validation of transaction Ti fails \\n(because Ti and Tj may violate serializability) and so Ti is aborted and restarted later \\nbecause interference with Tj may  have occurred.\\n21.4.2 Concurrency Control Based on Snapshot Isolation\\nAs we discussed in Section 20.6, the basic definition of snapshot isolation  is that a \\ntransaction sees the data items that it reads based on the committed values of the \\nitems in the database snapshot  (or database state) when the transaction starts. Snap-\\nshot isolation will ensure that the phantom record problem does not occur, since \\nthe database transaction, or, in some cases, the database statement, will only see the records that were committed in the database at the time the transaction started. Any insertions, deletions, or updates that occur after the transaction starts will not be seen by the transaction. In addition, snapshot isolation does not allow the prob-lems of dirty read and nonrepeatable read to occur. However, certain anomalies that violate serializability can occur when snapshot isolation is used as the basis for'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 830}, page_content='800 Chapter 21 Concurrency Control Techniques\\nconcurrency control. Although these anomalies are rare, they are very difficult to \\ndetect and may result in an inconsistent or corrupted database. The interested reader can refer to the end-of-chapter bibliography for papers that discuss in detail the rare types of anomalies that can occur.\\nIn this scheme, read operations do not require read locks to be applied to the items, \\nthus reducing the overhead associated with two-phase locking. However, write \\noperations do require write locks. Thus, for transactions that have many reads, the \\nperformance is much better than 2PL. When writes do occur, the system will have to keep track of older versions of the updated items in a temporary version store  \\n(sometimes known as tempstore), with the timestamps of when the version was created. This is necessary so that a transaction that started before the item was writ-ten can still read the value (version) of the item that was in the database snapshot when the transaction started.\\nTo keep track of versions, items that have been updated will have pointers to a list \\nof recent versions of the item in the tempstore,  so that the correct item can be read \\nfor each transaction. The tempstore items will be removed when no longer needed, so a method to decide when to remove unneeded versions will be needed.\\nVariations of this method have been used in several commercial and open source \\nDBMSs, including Oracle and PostGRES. If the users require guaranteed serializ-ability, then the problems with anomalies that violate serializability will have to be solved by the programmers/software engineers by analyzing the set of transactions to determine which types of anomalies can occur, and adding checks that do not permit these anomalies. This can place a burden on the software developers when compared to the DBMS enforcing serializability in all cases.\\nVariations of snapshot isolation (SI) techniques, known as serializable snapshot \\nisolation (SSI) , have been proposed and implemented in some of the DBMSs that \\nuse SI as their primary concurrency control method. For example, recent versions of the PostGRES DBMS allow the user to choose between basic SI and SSI. The tradeoff is ensuring full serializability with SSI versus living with possible rare anomalies but having better performance with basic SI. The interested reader is referred to the end-of-chapter bibliography for more complete discussions of these topics.\\n21.5  Granularity of Data Items and  \\nMultiple Granularity Locking\\nAll concurrency control techniques assume that the database is formed of a number \\nof named data items. A database item could be chosen to be one of the following:\\n ■A database record\\n ■A field value of a database record\\n ■A disk block\\n ■A whole file\\n ■The whole database'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 831}, page_content='21.5 Granularity of Data Items and Multiple Granularity Locking  801\\nThe particular choice of data item type can affect the performance of concurrency \\ncontrol and recovery. In Section 21.5.1, we discuss some of the tradeoffs with regard to choosing the granularity level used for locking; and in Section 21.5.2, we discuss a multiple granularity locking scheme, where the granularity level (size of the data item) may be changed dynamically.\\n21.5.1 Granularity Level Considerations for Locking\\nThe size of data items is often called the data item granularity . Fine granularity  \\nrefers to small item sizes, whereas coarse granularity  refers to large item sizes. Sev-\\neral tradeoffs must be considered in choosing the data item size. We will discuss data item size in the context of locking, although similar arguments can be made for other concurrency control techniques.\\nFirst, notice that the larger the data item size is, the lower the degree of concurrency \\npermitted. For example, if the data item size is a disk block, a transaction T that \\nneeds to lock a single record B must lock the whole disk block X that contains B \\nbecause a lock is associated with the whole data item (block). Now, if another trans-action S wants to lock a different record C that happens to reside in the same disk \\nblock X in a conflicting lock mode, it is forced to wait. If the data item size was a \\nsingle record instead of a disk block, transaction S would be able to proceed, because \\nit would be locking a different data item (record).\\nOn the other hand, the smaller the data item size is, the more the number of items \\nin the database. Because every item is associated with a lock, the system will have a larger number of active locks to be handled by the lock manager. More lock and unlock operations will be performed, causing a higher overhead. In addition, more storage space will be required for the lock table. For timestamps, storage is required for the \\nread_TS  and write_TS  for each data item, and there will be similar overhead \\nfor handling a large number of items.\\nGiven the above tradeoffs, an obvious question can be asked: What is the best item \\nsize? The answer is that it depends on the types of transactions involved . If a typical \\ntransaction accesses a small number of records, it is advantageous to have the data item granularity be one record. On the other hand, if a transaction typically accesses many records in the same file, it may be better to have block or file granularity so that the transaction will consider all those records as one (or a few) data items.\\n21.5.2 Multiple Granularity Level Locking\\nSince the best granularity size depends on the given transaction, it seems appropri-ate that a database system should support multiple levels of granularity, where the \\ngranularity level can be adjusted dynamically for various mixes of transactions. Fig-\\nure 21.7 shows a simple granularity hierarchy with a database containing two files, \\neach file containing several disk pages, and each page containing several records. This can be used to illustrate a multiple granularity level  2PL protocol, with \\nshared/exclusive locking modes, where a lock can be requested at any level. How-ever, additional types of locks will be needed to support such a protocol efficiently.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 832}, page_content='802 Chapter 21 Concurrency Control Techniques\\nConsider the following scenario, which refers to the example in Figure 21.7. Sup-\\npose transaction T1 wants to update all the records  in file f1, and T1 requests and is \\ngranted an exclusive lock for f1. Then all of f1’s pages ( p11 through p1n)—and the \\nrecords contained on those pages—are locked in exclusive mode. This is beneficial for T\\n1 because setting a single file-level lock is more efficient than setting n page-\\nlevel locks or having to lock each record individually. Now suppose another trans-action T\\n2 only wants to read record r1nj from page p1n of file f1; then T2 would \\nrequest a shared record-level lock on r1nj. However, the database system (that is, the \\ntransaction manager or, more specifically, the lock manager) must verify the com-patibility of the requested lock with already held locks. One way to verify this is to traverse the tree from the leaf r\\n1nj to p1n to f1 to db. If at any time a conflicting lock \\nis held on any of those items, then the lock request for r1nj is denied and T2 is \\nblocked and must wait. This traversal would be fairly efficient.\\nHowever, what if transaction T2’s request came before  transaction T1’s request? In \\nthis case, the shared record lock is granted to T2 for r1nj, but when T1’s file-level lock \\nis requested, it can be time-consuming for the lock manager to check all nodes (pages and records) that are descendants of node f\\n1 for a lock conflict. This would \\nbe very inefficient and would defeat the purpose of having multiple granularity level locks.\\nTo make multiple granularity level locking practical, additional types of locks, \\ncalled intention locks , are needed. The idea behind intention locks is for a transac-\\ntion to indicate, along the path from the root to the desired node, what type of lock (shared or exclusive) it will require from one of the node’s descendants. There are three types of intention locks:\\n  1. Intention-shared (IS) indicates that one or more shared locks will be requested on some descendant node(s).\\n  2. Intention-exclusive (IX) indicates that one or more exclusive locks will be requested on some descendant node(s).db\\nr111 r11j r121 r12j r1n1 r1nj r211 r21k r221 r22k r2m1 r2mk. . . . . . . . .. . .\\n. . . . . . . . . . . .. . .\\n. . .p11 p12f1\\np1n p21 p22 p2mf2\\nFigure 21.7 \\nA granularity hierarchy for illustrating multiple granularity level locking.'),\n",

Shared-intention-exclusive (SIX) indicates that the current node is locked in \\nshared mode but that one or more exclusive locks will be requested on some descendant node(s).\\nThe compatibility table of the three intention locks, and the actual shared and \\nexclusive locks, is shown in Figure 21.8. In addition to the three types of intention locks, an appropriate locking protocol must be used. The multiple granularity \\nlocking (MGL)  protocol consists of the following rules:\\n  1. The lock compatibility (based on Figure 21.8) must be adhered to.\\n  2. The root of the tree must be locked first, in any mode.\\n  3. A node N can be locked by a transaction T in S or IS mode only if the parent \\nnode N is already locked by transaction T in either IS or IX mode.\\n  4. A node N can be locked by a transaction T in X, IX, or SIX mode only if the \\nparent of node N is already locked by transaction T in either IX or SIX mode.\\n  5. A transaction T can lock a node only if it has not unlocked any node (to \\nenforce the 2PL protocol).\\n  6. A transaction T can unlock a node, N, only if none of the children of node N \\nare currently locked by T.\\nRule 1 simply states that conflicting locks cannot be granted. Rules 2, 3, and 4 state \\nthe conditions when a transaction may lock a given node in any of the lock modes. Rules 5 and 6 of the MGL protocol enforce 2PL rules to produce serializable sched-ules. Basically, the locking starts from the root  and goes down the tree until the \\nnode that needs to be locked is encountered, whereas unlocking starts from the \\nlocked node  and goes up the tree until the root itself is unlocked. To illustrate the \\nMGL protocol with the database hierarchy in Figure 21.7, consider the following three transactions:\\n  1. T1 wants to update record r111 and record r211.\\n  2. T2 wants to update all records on page p12.\\n  3.

However, holding locks on index pages until the shrinking phase of 2PL could cause an undue amount of transaction blocking because searching an index always starts at the \\nroot. For example, if a transaction wants to insert a record (write operation), the \\nroot would be locked in exclusive mode, so all other conflicting lock requests for the index must wait until the transaction enters its shrinking phase. This blocks all other transactions from accessing the index, so in practice other approaches to locking an index must be used.\\nThe tree structure of the index can be taken advantage of when developing a con-\\ncurrency control scheme. For example, when an index search (read operation) is being executed, a path in the tree is traversed from the root to a leaf. Once a lower-level node in the path has been accessed, the higher-level nodes in that path will not be used again. So once a read lock on a child node is obtained, the lock on the par-ent node can be released. When an insertion is being applied to a leaf node (that is, when a key and a pointer are inserted), then a specific leaf node must be locked in exclusive mode. However, if that node is not full, the insertion will not cause changes to higher-level index nodes, which implies that they need not be locked exclusively.\\nA conservative approach for insertions would be to lock the root node in exclusive \\nmode and then to access the appropriate child node of the root. If the child node is not full, then the lock on the root node can be released. This approach can be applied all the way down the tree to the leaf, which is typically three or four levels from the root. Although exclusive locks are held, they are soon released. An alterna-tive, more optimistic approach  would be to request and hold shared  locks on the \\nnodes leading to the leaf node, with an exclusive  lock on the leaf. If the insertion \\ncauses the leaf to split, insertion will propagate to one or more higher-level nodes. Then, the locks on the higher-level nodes can be upgraded to exclusive mode.\\nAnother approach to index locking is to use a variant of the B\\n+-tree, called the \\nB-link tree . In a B-link tree, sibling nodes on the same level are linked at every level. \\nThis allows shared locks to be used when requesting a page and requires that the lock be released before accessing the child node. For an insert operation, the shared lock on a node would be upgraded to exclusive mode. If a split occurs, the parent node must be relocked in exclusive mode. One complication is for search opera-tions executed concurrently with the update. Suppose that a concurrent update operation follows the same path as the search and inserts a new entry into the leaf node. Additionally, suppose that the insert causes that leaf node to split. When the insert is done, the search process resumes, following the pointer to the desired leaf, only to find that the key it is looking for is not present because the split has moved that key into a new leaf node, which would be the right sibling  of the original leaf'),\n",

However, the search process can still succeed if it follows the pointer (link) in \\nthe original leaf node to its right sibling, where the desired key has been moved.\\nHandling the deletion case, where two or more nodes from the index tree merge, is \\nalso part of the B-link tree concurrency protocol. In this case, locks on the nodes to be merged are held as well as a lock on the parent of the two nodes to be merged.\\n21.7 Other Concurrency Control Issues\\nIn this section, we discuss some other issues relevant to concurrency control. In Section 21.7.1, we discuss problems associated with insertion and deletion of records and we revisit the phantom problem , which may occur when records are \\ninserted. This problem was described as a potential problem requiring a concur-rency control measure in Section 20.6. In Section 21.7.2, we discuss problems that may occur when a transaction outputs some data to a monitor before it commits, and then the transaction is later aborted.\\n21.7.1 Insertion, Deletion, and Phantom Records\\nWhen a new data item is inserted  in the database, it obviously cannot be accessed \\nuntil after the item is created and the insert operation is completed. In a locking \\nenvironment, a lock for the item can be created and set to exclusive (write) mode; \\nthe lock can be released at the same time as other write locks would be released, based on the concurrency control protocol being used. For a timestamp-based pro-tocol, the read and write timestamps of the new item are set to the timestamp of the creating transaction.\\nNext, consider a deletion operation  that is applied on an existing data item. For \\nlocking protocols, again an exclusive (write) lock must be obtained before the trans-action can delete the item. For timestamp ordering, the protocol must ensure that no later transaction has read or written the item before allowing the item to be deleted.\\nA situation known as the phantom problem  can occur when a new record that is \\nbeing inserted by some transaction T satisfies a condition that a set of records \\naccessed by another transaction T′ must satisfy. For example, suppose that transac-\\ntion T is inserting a new \\nEMPLOYEE  record whose Dno = 5, whereas transaction T′ \\nis accessing all EMPLOYEE  records whose Dno = 5 (say, to add up all their Salary  \\nvalues to calculate the personnel budget for department 5). If the equivalent serial order is T followed by T′, then T′ must read the new \\nEMPLOYEE  record and include \\nits Salary  in the sum calculation. For the equivalent serial order T′ followed by T, the \\nnew salary should not be included. Notice that although the transactions logically conflict, in the latter case there is really no record (data item) in common between the two transactions, since T′ may have locked all the records with \\nDno = 5 before T  \\ninserted the new record. This is because the record that causes the conflict is a phantom record  that has suddenly appeared in the database on being inserted. If \\nother operations in the two transactions conflict, the conflict due to the phantom record may not be recognized by the concurrency control protocol.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 837}, page_content='21.8 Summary  807\\nOne solution to the phantom record problem is to use index locking , as discussed \\nin Section 21.6. Recall from Chapter 19 that an index includes entries that have an attribute value plus a set of pointers to all records in the file with that value. For example, an index on \\nDno of EMPLOYEE  would include an entry for each distinct \\nDno value plus a set of pointers to all EMPLOYEE  records with that value. If the index \\nentry is locked before the record itself can be accessed, then the conflict on the phantom record can be detected, because transaction T′ would request a read lock \\non the index entry  for \\nDno = 5, and T would request a write lock on the same entry \\nbefore  it could place the locks on the actual records. Since the index locks conflict, \\nthe phantom conflict would be detected.\\nA more general technique, called predicate locking , would lock access to all records \\nthat satisfy an arbitrary predicate  (condition) in a similar manner; however, predi-\\ncate locks have proved to be difficult to implement efficiently. If the concurrency control method is based on snapshot isolation (see Section 21.4.2), then the trans-action that reads the items will access the database snapshot at the time the transac-tion starts; any records inserted after that will not be retrieved by the transaction.\\n21.7.2 Interactive Transactions\\nAnother problem occurs when interactive transactions read input and write output to an interactive device, such as a monitor screen, before they are committed. The problem is that a user can input a value of a data item to a transaction T that is \\nbased on some value written to the screen by transaction T′, which may not have \\ncommitted. This dependency between T and T′ cannot be modeled by the system \\nconcurrency control method, since it is only based on the user interacting with the two transactions.\\nAn approach to dealing with this problem is to postpone output of transactions to \\nthe screen until they have committed.\\n21.7.3 Latches\\nLocks held for a short duration are typically called latches . Latches do not follow \\nthe usual concurrency control protocol such as two-phase locking. For example, a latch can be used to guarantee the physical integrity of a disk page when that page is being written from the buffer to disk. A latch would be acquired for the page, the page written to disk, and then the latch released.\\n21.8 Summary\\nIn this chapter, we discussed DBMS techniques for concurrency control. We started in Section 21.1 by discussing lock-based protocols, which are commonly used in practice. In Section 21.1.2 we described the two-phase locking (2PL) pro-tocol and a number of its variations: basic 2PL, strict 2PL, conservative 2PL, and rigorous 2PL. The strict and rigorous variations are more common because of'),\n",

We introduced the concepts of shared (read) \\nand exclusive (write) locks (Section 21.1.1) and showed how locking can guarantee serializability when used in conjunction with the two-phase locking rule. We also presented various techniques for dealing with the deadlock problem in Sec-tion\\xa021.1.3, which can occur with locking. In practice, it is common to use time-outs and deadlock detection (wait-for graphs). Deadlock prevention protocols, such as no waiting and cautious waiting, can also be used.\\nWe then presented other concurrency control protocols. These include the time-\\nstamp ordering protocol (Section 21.2), which ensures serializability based on the order of transaction timestamps. Timestamps are unique, system-generated trans-action identifiers. We discussed Thomas’s write rule, which improves performance but does not guarantee serializability. The strict timestamp ordering protocol was also presented. We discussed two multiversion protocols (Section 21.3), which assume that older versions of data items can be kept in the database. One tech-nique, called multiversion two-phase locking (which has been used in practice), assumes that two versions can exist for an item and attempts to increase concur-rency by making write and read locks compatible (at the cost of introducing an additional certify lock mode). We also presented a multiversion protocol based on timestamp ordering. In Section 21.4.1, we presented an example of an optimistic protocol, which is also known as a certification or validation protocol.\\nWe then discussed concurrency control methods that are based on the concept of \\nsnapshot isolation in Section 21.4.2; these are used in several DBMSs because of their lower overhead. The basic snapshot isolation method can allow nonserializ-able schedules in rare cases because of certain anomalies that are difficult to detect; these anomalies may cause a corrupted database. A variation known as serializable snapshot isolation has been recently developed and ensures serializable schedules.\\nThen in Section 21.5 we turned our attention to the important practical issue of \\ndata item granularity. We described a multigranularity locking protocol that allows the change of granularity (item size) based on the current transaction mix, with the goal of improving the performance of concurrency control. An important practical issue was then presented in Section 21.6, which is to develop locking protocols for indexes so that indexes do not become a hindrance to con-current access. Finally, in Section 21.7, we introduced the phantom problem and problems with interactive transactions, and we briefly described the concept of latches and how this concept differs from locks.\\nReview Questions\\n 21.1.

In Section 20.1.4 we discussed the different causes of failure, such as system \\ncrashes and transaction errors. In Section 20.2, we introduced some of the concepts that are used by recovery processes, such as the system log and commit points.\\nThis chapter presents additional concepts that are relevant to recovery protocols \\nand provides an overview of the various database recovery algorithms. We start \\nin Section 22.1 with an outline of a typical recovery procedure and a categoriza-\\ntion of recovery algorithms, and then we discuss several recovery concepts, including write-ahead logging, in-place versus shadow updates, and the process of rolling back (undoing) the effect of an incomplete or failed transaction. In Sec-tion 22.2, we present recovery techniques based on deferred update,  also known \\nas the \\nNO-UNDO/REDO  technique, where the data on disk is not updated until \\nafter  a transaction commits. In Section 22.3, we discuss recovery techniques based \\non immediate update , where data can be updated on disk during transaction exe-\\ncution; these include the UNDO/REDO  and UNDO/NO-REDO  algorithms. In Sec-\\ntion 22.4, we discuss the technique known as shadowing or shadow paging, which can be categorized as a \\nNO-UNDO/NO-REDO  algorithm. An example of a practical \\nDBMS recovery scheme, called ARIES, is presented in Section 22.5. Recovery in multidatabases is briefly discussed in Section 22.6. Finally, techniques for recov-ery from catastrophic failure are discussed in Section 22.7. Section 22.8 summa-rizes the chapter.\\nOur emphasis is on conceptually describing several different approaches to recov-\\nery. For descriptions of recovery features in specific systems, the reader should con-sult the bibliographic notes at the end of the chapter and the online and printed user manuals for those systems.

We will discuss recovery concepts indepen-\\ndently of concurrency control mechanisms.\\n22.1 Recovery Concepts\\n22.1.1  Recovery Outline and Categorization  \\nof Recovery Algorithms\\nRecovery from transaction failures usually means that the database is restored  to \\nthe most recent consistent state before the time of failure. To do this, the system must keep information about the changes that were applied to data items by the various transactions. This information is typically kept in the system log , as we \\ndiscussed in Section 21.2.2. A typical strategy for recovery may be summarized informally as follows:\\n  1. If there is extensive damage to a wide portion of the database due to cata-strophic failure, such as a disk crash, the recovery method restores a past copy of the database that was backed up  to archival storage (typically tape or \\nother large capacity offline storage media) and reconstructs a more current state by reapplying or redoing  the operations of committed transactions \\nfrom the backed-up  log, up to the time of failure.\\n  2. When the database on disk is not physically damaged, and a noncatastrophic \\nfailure of types 1 through 4 in Section 21.1.4 has occurred, the recovery \\nstrategy is to identify any changes that may cause an inconsistency in the \\ndatabase. For example, a transaction that has updated some database items \\non disk but has not been committed needs to have its changes reversed by undoing  its write operations. It may also be necessary to redo  some opera-\\ntions in order to restore a consistent state of the database; for example, if a \\ntransaction has committed but some of its write operations have not yet \\nbeen written to disk. For noncatastrophic failure, the recovery protocol does \\nnot need a complete archival copy of the database. Rather, the entries kept in the online system log on disk are analyzed to determine the appropriate actions for recovery.\\nConceptually, we can distinguish two main policies for recovery from non-\\ncatastrophic transaction failures: deferred update and immediate update. The deferred update  techniques do not physically update the database on disk until after  \\na transaction commits; then the updates are recorded in the database. Before reach-ing commit, all transaction updates are recorded in the local transaction workspace or in the main memory buffers that the DBMS maintains (the DBMS main memory cache; see Section 20.2.4). Before commit, the updates are recorded persistently in the log file on disk, and then after commit, the updates are written to the database from the main memory buffers. If a transaction fails before reaching its commit point, it will not have changed the database on disk in any way, so \\nUNDO  is not \\nneeded. It may be necessary to REDO  the effect of the operations of a committed'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 845}, page_content='22.1 Recovery Concepts  815\\ntransaction from the log, because their effect may not yet have been recorded in the \\ndatabase on disk. Hence, deferred update is also known as the NO-UNDO/REDO  \\nalgorithm . We discuss this technique in Section 22.2.\\nIn the immediate update  techniques, the database may be updated  by some opera-\\ntions of a transaction before  the transaction reaches its commit point. However, \\nthese operations must also be recorded in the log on disk  by force-writing before  \\nthey are applied to the database on disk, making recovery still possible. If a trans-\\naction fails after recording some changes in the database on disk but before reach-\\ning its commit point, the effect of its operations on the database must be undone; that is, the transaction must be rolled back. In the general case of immediate update, both undo  and redo  may be required during recovery. This technique, \\nknown as the \\nUNDO/REDO  algorithm , requires both operations during recovery \\nand is used most often in practice. A variation of the algorithm where all updates are required to be recorded in the database on disk before  a transaction commits \\nrequires undo  only, so it is known as the \\nUNDO/NO-REDO  algorithm . We discuss \\nthese two techniques in Section 22.3.\\nThe UNDO  and REDO  operations are required to be idempotent —that is, executing \\nan operation multiple times is equivalent to executing it just once. In fact, the whole \\nrecovery process should be idempotent because if the system were to fail during the \\nrecovery process, the next recovery attempt might UNDO  and REDO  certain  \\nwrite_item  operations that had already been executed during the first recovery pro-\\ncess. The result of recovery from a system crash during recovery  should be the same \\nas the result of recovering when there is no crash during recovery !\\n22.1.2 Caching (Buffering) of Disk Blocks\\nThe recovery process is often closely intertwined with operating system func-\\ntions—in particular, the buffering of database disk pages in the DBMS main memory cache. Typically, multiple disk pages that include the data items to be updated are cached  into main memory buffers and then updated in memory \\nbefore being written back to disk. The caching of disk pages is traditionally an operating system function, but because of its importance to the efficiency of recovery procedures, it is handled by the DBMS by calling low-level operating systems routines (see Section 20.2.4).\\nIn general, it is convenient to consider recovery in terms of the database disk pages \\n(blocks). Typically a collection of in-memory buffers, called the DBMS cache , is \\nkept under the control of the DBMS for the purpose of holding these buffers. A directory  for the cache is used to keep track of which database items are in the buf-\\nfers.\\n1 This can be a table of < Disk_page_address , Buffer_location , … > entries. When \\nthe DBMS requests action on some item, first it checks the cache directory to deter-mine whether the disk page containing the item is in the DBMS cache. If it is not, \\n1This is somewhat similar to the concept of page tables used by the operating system.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 846}, page_content='816 Chapter 22 Database Recovery Techniques\\nthe item must be located on disk, and the appropriate disk pages are copied into the \\ncache. It may be necessary to replace  (or flush ) some of the cache buffers to make \\nspace available for the new item (see Section 20.2.4).\\nThe entries in the DBMS cache directory hold additional information relevant to \\nbuffer management. Associated with each buffer in the cache is a dirty bit , which \\ncan be included in the directory entry to indicate whether or not the buffer has been \\nmodified. When a page is first read from the database disk into a cache buffer, a new \\nentry is inserted in the cache directory with the new disk page address, and the dirty bit is set to 0 (zero). As soon as the buffer is modified, the dirty bit for the corre-sponding directory entry is set to 1 (one). Additional information, such as the trans-action id(s) of the transaction(s) that modified the buffer, are also kept in the directory. When the buffer contents are replaced (flushed) from the cache, the con-tents must first be written back to the corresponding disk page only if its dirty bit is 1 .\\nAnother bit, called the pin-unpin  bit, is also needed—a page in the cache is pinned  \\n(bit value 1 (one)) if it cannot be written back to disk as yet. For example, the recov-ery protocol may restrict certain buffer pages from being written back to the disk until the transactions that changed this buffer have committed.\\nTwo main strategies can be employed when flushing a modified buffer back to disk. \\nThe first strategy, known as in-place updating , writes the buffer to the same origi-\\nnal disk location,  thus overwriting the old value of any changed data items on disk.\\n2 \\nHence, a single copy of each database disk block is maintained. The second strategy, \\nknown as shadowing , writes an updated buffer at a different disk location, so mul-\\ntiple versions of data items can be maintained, but this approach is not typically \\nused in practice.\\nIn general, the old value of the data item before updating is called the before image \\n(BFIM) , and the new value after updating is called the after image (AFIM) . If shad-\\nowing is used, both the BFIM and the AFIM can be kept on disk; hence, it is not strictly necessary to maintain a log for recovering. We briefly discuss recovery based on shadowing in Section 22.4.\\n22.1.3  Write-Ahead Logging, Steal/No-Steal,  \\nand Force/No-Force\\nWhen in-place updating is used, it is necessary to use a log for recovery (see Sec-\\ntion\\xa021.2.2). In this case, the recovery mechanism must ensure that the BFIM of the \\ndata item is recorded in the appropriate log entry and that the log entry is flushed to \\ndisk before the BFIM is overwritten with the AFIM in the database on disk. This \\nprocess is generally known as write-ahead logging  and is necessary so we can \\nUNDO  the operation if this is required during recovery. Before we can describe a \\nprotocol for write-ahead logging, we need to distinguish between two types of log entry information included for a write command: the information needed for \\nUNDO  \\n2In-place updating is used in most systems in practice.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 847}, page_content='22.1 Recovery Concepts  817\\nand the information needed for REDO . A REDO -type log entry  includes the new \\nvalue  (AFIM) of the item written by the operation since this is needed to redo  the \\neffect of the operation from the log (by setting the item value in the database on disk to its AFIM). The \\nUNDO -type log entries  include the old value  (BFIM) of the \\nitem since this is needed to undo  the effect of the operation from the log (by setting \\nthe item value in the database back to its BFIM). In an UNDO/REDO  algorithm, both \\nBFIM and AFIM are recorded into a single log entry. Additionally, when cascading rollback (see Section 22.1.5) is possible, \\nread_item  entries in the log are considered to \\nbe UNDO -type entries.\\nAs mentioned, the DBMS cache holds the cached database disk blocks in main \\nmemory buffers. The DBMS cache includes not only data file blocks , but also index \\nfile blocks  and log file blocks  from the disk. When a log record is written, it is stored \\nin the current log buffer in the DBMS cache. The log is simply a sequential (append-only) disk file, and the DBMS cache may contain several log blocks in main mem-ory buffers (typically, the last n log blocks of the log file). When an update to a data \\nblock—stored in the DBMS cache—is made, an associated log record is written to the last log buffer in the DBMS cache. With the write-ahead logging approach, the log buffers (blocks) that contain the associated log records for a particular data block update must first be written to disk  before the data block itself can be written \\nback to disk from its main memory buffer.\\nStandard DBMS recovery terminology includes the terms steal/no-steal  and  \\nforce/no-force , which specify the rules that govern when  a page from the database \\ncache can be written to disk:\\n  1. If a cache buffer page updated by a transaction cannot  be written to disk before \\nthe transaction commits, the recovery method is called a no-steal approach . \\nThe pin-unpin bit will be set to 1 (pin) to indicate that a cache buffer cannot be \\nwritten back to disk. On the other hand, if the recovery protocol allows writing an updated buffer before  the transaction commits, it is called steal . Steal is \\nused when the DBMS cache (buffer) manager needs a buffer frame for another transaction and the buffer manager replaces an existing page that had been updated but whose transaction has not committed. The no-steal rule  means \\nthat \\nUNDO  will never be needed during recovery, since a committed transac-\\ntion will not have any of its updates on disk before it commits.\\n  2. If all pages updated by a transaction are immediately written to disk before  \\nthe transaction commits, the recovery approach is called a force approach . \\nOtherwise, it is called no-force . The force rule  means that REDO  will never \\nbe needed during recovery, since any committed transaction will have all its \\nupdates on disk before it is committed.\\nThe deferred update ( NO-UNDO ) recovery scheme discussed in Section 22.2 follows \\na no-steal  approach. However, typical database systems employ a steal/no-force  \\n(UNDO/REDO) strategy. The advantage of steal  is that it avoids the need for a very \\nlarge buffer space to store all updated pages in memory. The advantage of no-force  \\nis that an updated page of a committed transaction may still be in the buffer when'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 848}, page_content='818 Chapter 22 Database Recovery Techniques\\nanother transaction needs to update it, thus eliminating the I/O cost to write that \\npage multiple times to disk and possibly having to read it again from disk. This may provide a substantial saving in the number of disk I/O operations when a specific page is updated heavily by multiple transactions.\\nTo permit recovery when in-place updating is used, the appropriate entries required \\nfor recovery must be permanently recorded in the log on disk before changes are \\napplied to the database. For example, consider the following write-ahead logging \\n(WAL)  protocol for a recovery algorithm that requires both \\nUNDO  and REDO :\\n  1. The before image of an item cannot be overwritten by its after image in the \\ndatabase on disk until all UNDO -type log entries for the updating transaction—\\nup to this point—have been force-written to disk.\\n  2. The commit operation of a transaction cannot be completed until all the \\nREDO -type and UNDO -type log records for that transaction have been force-\\nwritten to disk.\\nTo facilitate the recovery process, the DBMS recovery subsystem may need to \\nmaintain a number of lists related to the transactions being processed in the system. These include a list for active transactions  that have started but not committed as \\nyet, and they may also include lists of all committed  and aborted transactions  \\nsince the last checkpoint (see the next section). Maintaining these lists makes the recovery process more efficient.\\n22.1.4  Checkpoints in the System Log  \\nand Fuzzy Checkpointing\\nAnother type of entry in the log is called a checkpoint .3 A [checkpoint, list of active \\ntransactions ] record is written into the log periodically at that point when the system \\nwrites out to the database on disk all DBMS buffers that have been modified. As a consequence of this, all transactions that have their \\n[commit,  T ] entries in the log \\nbefore a [checkpoint]  entry do not need to have their WRITE  operations redone  in \\ncase of a system crash, since all their updates will be recorded in the database on \\ndisk during checkpointing. As part of checkpointing, the list of transaction ids for \\nactive transactions at the time of the checkpoint is included in the checkpoint record, so that these transactions can be easily identified during recovery.\\nThe recovery manager of a DBMS must decide at what intervals to take a check-\\npoint. The interval may be measured in time—say, every m minutes—or in the \\nnumber t of committed transactions since the last checkpoint, where the values of \\nm or t are system parameters. Taking a checkpoint consists of the following actions:\\n  1. Suspend execution of transactions temporarily.\\n  2. Force-write all main memory buffers that have been modified to disk.\\n3The term checkpoint  has been used to describe more restrictive situations in some systems, such as \\nDB2. It has also been used in the literature to describe entirely different concepts.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 849}, page_content='22.1 Recovery Concepts  819\\n  3. Write a [checkpoint]  record to the log, and force-write the log to disk.\\n  4. Resume executing transactions.\\nAs a consequence of step 2, a checkpoint record in the log may also include addi-\\ntional information, such as a list of active transaction ids, and the locations \\n(addresses) of the first and most recent (last) records in the log for each active \\ntransaction. This can facilitate undoing transaction operations in the event that a transaction must be rolled back.\\nThe time needed to force-write all modified memory buffers may delay transaction \\nprocessing because of step 1, which is not acceptable in practice. To overcome this, it is common to use a technique called fuzzy checkpointing . In this technique, the \\nsystem can resume transaction processing after a \\n[begin_checkpoint]  record is writ-\\nten to the log without having to wait for step 2 to finish. When step 2 is completed, an \\n[end_checkpoint, … ]  record is written in the log with the relevant information \\ncollected during checkpointing. However, until step 2 is completed, the previous checkpoint record should remain valid. To accomplish this, the system maintains a file on disk that contains a pointer to the valid checkpoint, which continues to point to the previous checkpoint record in the log. Once step 2 is concluded, that pointer is changed to point to the new checkpoint in the log.\\n22.1.5 Transaction Rollback and Cascading Rollback\\nIf a transaction fails for whatever reason after updating the database, but before the transaction commits, it may be necessary to roll back  the transaction. If any data \\nitem values have been changed by the transaction and written to the database on \\ndisk, they must be restored to their previous values (BFIMs). The undo-type log \\nentries are used to restore the old values of data items that must be rolled back.\\nIf a transaction T is rolled back, any transaction S that has, in the interim, read the \\nvalue of some data item X written by T must also be rolled back. Similarly, once S is \\nrolled back, any transaction R that has read the value of some data item Y written by \\nS must also be rolled back; and so on. This phenomenon is called cascading \\n rollback , and it can occur when the recovery protocol ensures recoverable  schedules \\nbut does not ensure strict  or cascadeless  schedules (see Section 20.4.2). Understand-\\nably, cascading rollback can be complex and time-consuming. That is why almost all recovery mechanisms are designed so that cascading rollback is never required.\\nFigure 22.1 shows an example where cascading rollback is required. The read and \\nwrite operations of three individual transactions are shown in Figure 22.1(a). Fig-ure\\xa022.1(b) shows the system log at the point of a system crash for a particular execution schedule of these transactions. The values of data items A, B, C, and D, which are used \\nby the transactions, are shown to the right of the system log entries. We assume that the original item values, shown in the first line, are A = 30, B = 15, C = 40, and D = 20. At the \\npoint of system failure, transaction T\\n3 has not reached its conclusion and must be rolled \\nback. The WRITE  operations of T3, marked by a single * in Figure 22.1(b), are the T3 \\noperations that are undone during transaction rollback. Figure 22.1(c) graphically \\nshows the operations of the different transactions along the time axis.'),\n",

From Figure 22.1(c), we see that trans-\\naction T2 reads the value of item B that was written by transaction T3; this can also \\nbe determined by examining the log. Because T3 is rolled back, T2 must now be \\nrolled back, too. The WRITE  operations of T2, marked by ** in the log, are the ones \\nthat are undone. Note that only write_item  operations need to be undone during \\ntransaction rollback; read_item  operations are recorded in the log only to determine \\nwhether cascading rollback of additional transactions is necessary.\\nIn practice, cascading rollback of transactions is never  required because practical \\nrecovery methods guarantee cascadeless or strict  schedules. Hence, there is also no \\nneed to record any read_item  operations in the log because these are needed only for \\ndetermining cascading rollback.\\n22.1.6 Transaction Actions That Do Not Affect the Database\\nIn general, a transaction will have actions that do not affect the database, such as \\ngenerating and printing messages or reports from information retrieved from the database. If a transaction fails before completion, we may not want the user to get these reports, since the transaction has failed to complete. If such erroneous reports are produced, part of the recovery process would have to inform the user that these reports are wrong, since the user may take an action that is based on these reports and that affects the database. Hence, such reports should be generated only after the \\ntransaction reaches its commit point.  A common method of dealing with such \\nactions is to issue the commands that generate the reports but keep them as batch jobs, which are executed only after the transaction reaches its commit point. If the transaction fails, the batch jobs are canceled.\\n22.2  NO-UNDO/REDO Recovery Based  \\non Deferred Update\\nThe idea behind deferred update is to defer or postpone any actual updates to the \\ndatabase on disk until the transaction completes its execution successfully and \\nreaches its commit point.4\\nDuring transaction execution, the updates are recorded only in the log and in the \\ncache buffers. After the transaction reaches its commit point and the log is force-written to disk, the updates are recorded in the database. If a transaction fails before reaching its commit point, there is no need to undo any operations because the \\ntransaction has not affected the database on disk in any way. Therefore, only \\nREDO -\\ntype log entries  are needed in the log, which include the new value  (AFIM) of the \\nitem written by a write operation. The UNDO -type log entries  are not needed since \\nno undoing of operations will be required during recovery. Although this may sim-plify the recovery process, it cannot be used in practice unless transactions are short and each transaction changes few items. For other types of transactions, there is the \\npotential for running out of buffer space because transaction changes must be held \\n4Hence deferred update can generally be characterized as a no-steal approach.'),\n",

A transaction cannot change the database on disk until it reaches its commit \\npoint; hence all buffers that have been changed by the transaction must be pinned until the transaction commits (this corresponds to a no-steal policy ).\\n  2. A transaction does not reach its commit point until all its REDO -type log \\nentries are recorded in the log and the log buffer is force-written to disk.\\nNotice that step 2 of this protocol is a restatement of the write-ahead logging (WAL) \\nprotocol. Because the database is never updated on disk until after the transaction commits, there is never a need to \\nUNDO  any operations. REDO  is needed in case the \\nsystem fails after a transaction commits but before all its changes are recorded in the database on disk. In this case, the transaction operations are redone from the log entries during recovery.\\nFor multiuser systems with concurrency control, the concurrency control and \\nrecovery processes are interrelated. Consider a system in which concurrency con-trol uses strict two-phase locking, so the locks on written items remain in effect until the transaction reaches its commit point.  After that, the locks can be released. \\nThis ensures strict and serializable schedules. Assuming that \\n[checkpoint]  entries are \\nincluded in the log, a possible recovery algorithm for this case, which we call RDU_M  \\n(Recovery using Deferred Update in a Multiuser environment), is given next.\\nProcedure RDU_M (NO-UNDO/REDO  with checkpoints).  Use two lists of trans-\\nactions maintained by the system: the committed transactions T since the last \\ncheckpoint ( commit list ), and the active transactions T′ (active list ). REDO  all \\nthe WRITE  operations of the committed transactions from the log, in the order \\nin which they were written into the log.  The transactions that are active and did \\nnot commit are effectively canceled and must be resubmitted.\\nThe REDO  procedure is defined as follows:\\nProcedure  REDO (WRITE_OP) . Redoing a write_item  operation WRITE_OP  con-\\nsists of examining its log entry [write_item,  T, X, new_value]  and setting the value \\nof item X in the database to new_value , which is the after image (AFIM).\\nFigure 22.2 illustrates a timeline for a possible schedule of executing transactions. \\nWhen the checkpoint was taken at time t1, transaction T1 had committed, whereas \\ntransactions T3 and T4 had not.

The write_item  operations of T2 and T3 must be \\nredone, however, because both transactions reached their commit points after the \\nlast checkpoint. Recall that the log is force-written before committing a transaction. \\nTransactions T4 and T5 are ignored: They are effectively canceled or rolled back \\nbecause none of their write_item  operations were recorded in the database on disk \\nunder the deferred update protocol (no-steal policy).'),\n",

A drawback of the method described here is that it limits the concurrent execution of transactions because all write-locked items remain locked until the transaction reaches its commit \\npoint.  Additionally, it may require excessive buffer space to hold all updated items \\nuntil the transactions commit. The method’s main benefit is that transaction opera-tions never need to be undone,  for two reasons:\\n  1. A transaction does not record any changes in the database on disk until after \\nit reaches its commit point—that is, until it completes its execution success-fully. Hence, a transaction is never rolled back because of failure during transaction execution.\\n  2. A transaction will never read the value of an item that is written by an uncommitted transaction, because items remain locked until a transaction reaches its commit point. Hence, no cascading rollback will occur.\\nFigure 22.3 shows an example of recovery for a multiuser system that utilizes the \\nrecovery and concurrency control method just described.\\n22.3  Recovery Techniques Based  \\non Immediate Update\\nIn these techniques, when a transaction issues an update command, the database on \\ndisk can be updated immediately , without any need to wait for the transaction to \\nreach its commit point.

If the transaction is allowed to commit before all its changes are written to the database, we have the most general case, known as the \\nUNDO/REDO  \\nrecovery algorithm . In this case, the steal/no-force strategy  is applied (see \\nSection 22.1.3). This is also the most complex technique, but the most com-monly used in practice. We will outline an \\nUNDO/REDO  recovery algorithm \\nand leave it as an exercise for the reader to develop the UNDO/NO-REDO  \\nvariation. In Section 22.5, we describe a more practical approach known as the ARIES recovery technique.\\nWhen concurrent execution is permitted, the recovery process again depends on \\nthe protocols used for concurrency control. The procedure \\nRIU_M  (Recovery using \\nImmediate Updates for a Multiuser environment) outlines a recovery algorithm for concurrent transactions with immediate update (\\nUNDO/REDO  recovery). Assume \\nthat the log includes checkpoints and that the concurrency control protocol produces strict schedules —as, for example, the strict two-phase locking protocol \\ndoes. Recall that a strict schedule does not allow a transaction to read or write an item unless the transaction that wrote the item has committed. However, deadlocks can occur in strict two-phase locking, thus requiring abort and \\nUNDO  of transac-\\ntions. For a strict schedule, UNDO  of an operation requires changing the item back \\nto its old value (BFIM).\\nProcedure RIU_M  (UNDO/REDO  with checkpoints).\\n  1. Use two lists of transactions maintained by the system: the committed \\ntransactions since the last checkpoint and the active transactions.\\n  2. Undo all the write_item  operations of the active  (uncommitted) transac-\\ntions, using the UNDO  procedure. The operations should be undone in \\nthe reverse of the order in which they were written into the log.\\n  3. Redo all the write_item  operations of the committed  transactions from \\nthe log, in the order in which they were written into the log, using the \\nREDO  procedure defined earlier.\\nThe UNDO  procedure is defined as follows:\\nProcedure UNDO  (WRITE_OP ). Undoing a write_item  operation write_op  consists \\nof examining its log entry [write_item,  T, X, old_value, new_value]  and setting the \\nvalue of item X in the database to old_value , which is the before image (BFIM). \\nUndoing a number of write_item  operations from one or more transactions from \\nthe log must proceed in the reverse order  from the order in which the operations \\nwere written in the log.\\nAs we discussed for the NO-UNDO/REDO  procedure, step 3 is more efficiently done \\nby starting from the end of the log  and redoing only the last update of each item X.  \\nWhenever an item is redone, it is added to a list of redone items and is not redone \\nagain. A similar procedure can be devised to improve the efficiency of step 2 so \\nthat an item can be undone at most once during recovery. In this case, the earliest \\nUNDO  is applied first by scanning the log in the forward direction (starting from'),\n",

Whenever an item is undone, it is added to a list of \\nundone items and is not undone again.\\n22.4 Shadow Paging\\nThis recovery scheme does not require the use of a log in a single-user environ-ment. In a multiuser environment, a log may be needed for the concurrency control method. Shadow paging considers the database to be made up of a number of fixed-size disk pages (or disk blocks)—say, n—for recovery purposes. A directory  with n \\nentries\\n5 is constructed, where the ith entry points to the ith database page on disk. \\nThe directory is kept in main memory if it is not too large, and all references—reads or writes—to database pages on disk go through it. When a transaction begins exe-cuting, the current directory —whose entries point to the most recent or current \\ndatabase pages on disk—is copied into a shadow directory . The shadow directory \\nis then saved on disk while the current directory is used by the transaction.\\nDuring transaction execution, the shadow directory is never  modified. When a \\nwrite_item  operation is performed, a new copy of the modified database page is cre-\\nated, but the old copy of that page is not overwritten.  Instead, the new page is writ-\\nten elsewhere—on some previously unused disk block. The current directory entry is modified to point to the new disk block, whereas the shadow directory is not modified and continues to point to the old unmodified disk block. Figure 22.4 illus-trates the concepts of shadow and current directories. For pages updated by the transaction, two versions are kept. The old version is referenced by the shadow directory and the new version by the current directory.\\n5The directory is similar to the page table maintained by the operating system for each process.Current directory\\n(after updating \\npages 2, 5)Database disk \\nblocks (pages)Shadow directory\\n(not updated)\\nPage 5 (old)\\nPage 1\\nPage 4Page 2 (old)Page 3\\nPage 6\\nPage 2 (new)Page 5 (new)1\\n2\\n34561\\n2\\n3456Figure 22.4 \\nAn example of shadow paging.'),\n",

The state of the data-base before transaction execution is available through the shadow directory, and that state is recovered by reinstating the shadow directory. The database thus is returned to its state prior to the transaction that was executing when the crash occurred, and any modified pages are discarded. Committing a transaction corre-sponds to discarding the previous shadow directory. Since recovery involves nei-ther undoing nor redoing data items, this technique can be categorized as a \\nNO-UNDO/NO-REDO  technique for recovery.\\nIn a multiuser environment with concurrent transactions, logs and checkpoints must \\nbe incorporated into the shadow paging technique. One disadvantage of shadow pag-ing is that the updated database pages change location on disk. This makes it difficult to keep related database pages close together on disk without complex storage man-agement strategies. Furthermore, if the directory is large, the overhead of writing shadow directories to disk as transactions commit is significant. A further complica-tion is how to handle garbage collection  when a transaction commits. The old pages \\nreferenced by the shadow directory that have been updated must be released and added to a list of free pages for future use. These pages are no longer needed after the transaction commits. Another issue is that the operation to migrate between current and shadow directories must be implemented as an atomic operation.\\n22.5 The ARIES Recovery Algorithm\\nWe now describe the ARIES algorithm as an example of a recovery algorithm used in database systems. It is used in many relational database-related products of IBM. ARIES uses a steal/no-force approach for writing, and it is based on three concepts: write-ahead logging, repeating history during redo, and logging changes during undo. We discussed write-ahead logging in Section 22.1.3. The second concept, repeating history , means that ARIES will retrace all actions of the database system \\nprior to the crash to reconstruct the database state when the crash occurred.  Trans-\\nactions that were uncommitted at the time of the crash (active transactions) are undone. The third concept, logging during undo , will prevent ARIES from repeat-\\ning the completed undo operations if a failure occurs during recovery, which causes a restart of the recovery process.\\nThe ARIES recovery procedure consists of three main steps: analysis, \\nREDO , and \\nUNDO . The analysis step  identifies the dirty (updated) pages in the buffer6 and the \\nset of transactions active at the time of the crash. The appropriate point in the log where the \\nREDO  operation should start is also determined. The REDO  phase  actu-\\nally reapplies updates from the log to the database. Generally, the REDO  operation \\nis applied only to committed transactions. However, this is not the case in ARIES. \\n6The actual buffers may be lost during a crash, since they are in main memory. Additional tables stored in \\nthe log during checkpointing (Dirty Page Table, Transaction Table) allow ARIES to identify this information (as discussed later in this section).'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 858}, page_content='828 Chapter 22 Database Recovery Techniques\\nCertain information in the ARIES log will provide the start point for REDO , from \\nwhich REDO  operations are applied until the end of the log is reached. Additionally, \\ninformation stored by ARIES and in the data pages will allow ARIES to determine whether the operation to be redone has actually been applied to the database and therefore does not need to be reapplied. Thus, only the necessary REDO operations  \\nare applied during recovery. Finally, during the \\nUNDO  phase , the log is scanned \\nbackward and the operations of transactions that were active at the time of the crash are undone in reverse order. The information needed for ARIES to accomplish its recovery procedure includes the log, the Transaction Table, and the Dirty Page Table. Additionally, checkpointing is used. These tables are maintained by the transaction manager and written to the log during checkpointing.\\nIn ARIES, every log record has an associated log sequence number (LSN)  that is \\nmonotonically increasing and indicates the address of the log record on disk. Each LSN corresponds to a specific change  (action) of some transaction. Also, each data \\npage will store the LSN of the latest log record corresponding to a change for that \\npage.  A log record is written for any of the following actions: updating a page \\n(write), committing a transaction (commit), aborting a transaction (abort), undo-ing an update (undo), and ending a transaction (end). The need for including the first three actions in the log has been discussed, but the last two need some explana-tion. When an update is undone, a compensation log record  is written in the log so \\nthat the undo does not have to be repeated. When a transaction ends, whether by \\ncommitting or aborting, an end log record  is written.\\nCommon fields in all log records include the previous LSN for that transaction, the \\ntransaction ID, and the type of log record. The previous LSN is important because \\nit links the log records (in reverse order) for each transaction. For an update (write) action, additional fields in the log record include the page ID for the page that con-tains the item, the length of the updated item, its offset from the beginning of the page, the before image of the item, and its after image.\\nIn addition to the log, two tables are needed for efficient recovery: the Transaction \\nTable  and the Dirty Page Table , which are maintained by the transaction manager. \\nWhen a crash occurs, these tables are rebuilt in the analysis phase of recovery. The Transaction Table contains an entry for each active transaction,  with information \\nsuch as the transaction ID, transaction status, and the LSN of the most recent log record for the transaction. The Dirty Page Table contains an entry for each dirty page in the DBMS cache, which includes the page ID and the LSN corresponding to the earliest update to that page.\\nCheckpointing  in ARIES consists of the following: writing a \\nbegin_checkpoint  \\nrecord to the log, writing an end_checkpoint  record to the log, and writing the LSN \\nof the begin_checkpoint  record to a special file. This special file is accessed during \\nrecovery to locate the last checkpoint information. With the end_checkpoint  record, \\nthe contents of both the Transaction Table and Dirty Page Table are appended to \\nthe end of the log. To reduce the cost, fuzzy checkpointing  is used so that the \\nDBMS can continue to execute transactions during checkpointing (see Sec-\\ntion\\xa022.1.4). Additionally, the contents of the DBMS cache do not have to be flushed'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 859}, page_content='22.5 The ARIES Recovery Algorithm  829\\nto disk during checkpoint, since the Transaction Table and Dirty Page Table—\\nwhich are appended to the log on disk—contain the information needed for  recovery. Note that if a crash occurs during checkpointing, the special file will refer to the previous checkpoint, which would be used for recovery.\\nAfter a crash, the ARIES recovery manager takes over. Information from the \\nlast checkpoint is first accessed through the special file. The analysis phase  \\nstarts at the \\nbegin_checkpoint  record and proceeds to the end of the log. When the \\nend_checkpoint  record is encountered, the Transaction Table and Dirty Page Table \\nare accessed (recall that these tables were written in the log during checkpointing). During analysis, the log records being analyzed may cause modifications to these two tables. For instance, if an end log record was encountered for a transaction T in \\nthe Transaction Table, then the entry for T is deleted from that table. If some other \\ntype of log record is encountered for a transaction T′, then an entry for T′ is inserted \\ninto the Transaction Table, if not already present, and the last LSN field is modified. If the log record corresponds to a change for page P, then an entry would be made \\nfor page P (if not present in the table) and the associated LSN field would be \\n modified. When the analysis phase is complete, the necessary information for \\nREDO  and UNDO  has been compiled in the tables.\\nThe REDO  phase  follows next. To reduce the amount of unnecessary work, ARIES \\nstarts redoing at a point in the log where it knows (for sure) that previous changes \\nto dirty pages have already been applied to the database on disk.  It can determine \\nthis by finding the smallest LSN, M, of all the dirty pages in the Dirty Page Table, \\nwhich indicates the log position where ARIES needs to start the REDO  phase. Any \\nchanges corresponding to an LSN < M, for redoable transactions, must have already \\nbeen propagated to disk or already been overwritten in the buffer; otherwise, those \\ndirty pages with that LSN would be in the buffer (and the Dirty Page Table). So, \\nREDO  starts at the log record with LSN = M and scans forward to the end of the log.\\nFor each change recorded in the log, the REDO  algorithm would verify whether or \\nnot the change has to be reapplied. For example, if a change recorded in the log pertains to page P that is not in the Dirty Page Table, then this change is already on \\ndisk and does not need to be reapplied. Or, if a change recorded in the log (with LSN = N, say) pertains to page P and the Dirty Page Table contains an entry for P \\nwith LSN greater than N, then the change is already present. If neither of these two \\nconditions holds, page P is read from disk and the LSN stored on that page, LSN( P), \\nis compared with N. If N < LSN( P), then the change has been applied and the page \\ndoes not need to be rewritten to disk.\\nOnce the \\nREDO  phase is finished, the database is in the exact state that it was in \\nwhen the crash occurred. The set of active transactions—called the undo_set —has \\nbeen identified in the Transaction Table during the analysis phase. Now, the UNDO  \\nphase  proceeds by scanning backward from the end of the log and undoing the \\nappropriate actions. A compensating log record is written for each action that is \\nundone. The UNDO  reads backward in the log until every action of the set of trans-\\nactions in the undo_set  has been undone. When this is completed, the recovery pro-\\ncess is finished and normal processing can begin again.'),\n",

Hence the REDO  \\nwill start at log record 1 and proceed with the REDO  of updates. The LSNs {1, 2, 6, 7} \\ncorresponding to the updates for pages C, B, A, and C, respectively, are not less than the LSNs of those pages (as shown in the Dirty Page Table). So those data pages will be read again and the updates reapplied from the log (assuming the actual LSNs stored on those data pages are less than the corresponding log entry). At this point, the \\nREDO  phase is finished and the UNDO  phase starts. From the Transaction \\nTable (Figure 22.5(c)), UNDO  is applied only to the active transaction T3. The UNDO  \\nphase starts at log entry 6 (the last update for T3) and proceeds backward in the log. \\nThe backward chain of updates for transaction T3 (only log record 6 in this exam-\\nple) is followed and undone.\\n22.6 Recovery in Multidatabase Systems\\nSo far, we have implicitly assumed that a transaction accesses a single database. In \\nsome cases, a single transaction, called a multidatabase transaction , may require \\naccess to multiple databases. These databases may even be stored on different types of \\nDBMSs; for example, some DBMSs may be relational, whereas others are object-\\noriented, hierarchical, or network DBMSs. In such a case, each DBMS involved in the \\nmultidatabase transaction may have its own recovery technique and transaction man-\\nager separate from those of the other DBMSs. This situation is somewhat similar to the \\ncase of a distributed database management system (see Chapter 23), where parts of the database reside at different sites that are connected by a communication network.\\nTo maintain the atomicity of a multidatabase transaction, it is necessary to have a \\ntwo-level recovery mechanism. A global recovery manager , or coordinator , is \\nneeded to maintain information needed for recovery, in addition to the local recov-\\nery managers and the information they maintain (log, tables). The coordinator usu-ally follows a protocol called the two-phase commit protocol , whose two phases \\ncan be stated as follows:\\n ■Phase 1.  When all participating databases signal the coordinator that the \\npart of the multidatabase transaction involving each has concluded, the coordinator sends a message prepare for commit  to each participant to get \\nready for committing the transaction. Each participating database receiving that message will force-write all log records and needed information for local recovery to disk and then send a ready to commit  or OK signal to the \\ncoordinator. If the force-writing to disk fails or the local transaction cannot commit for some reason, the participating database sends a cannot commit  \\nor not OK  signal to the coordinator. If the coordinator does not receive a \\nreply from the database within a certain time out interval, it assumes a not \\nOK response.\\n ■Phase 2.  If all participating databases reply OK, and the coordinator’s vote is \\nalso OK, the transaction is successful, and the coordinator sends a commit  \\nsignal for the transaction to the participating databases. Because all the local \\neffects of the transaction and information needed for local recovery have'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 862}, page_content='832 Chapter 22 Database Recovery Techniques\\nbeen recorded in the logs of the participating databases, local recovery from \\nfailure is now possible. Each participating database completes transaction commit by writing a \\n[commit]  entry for the transaction in the log and perma-\\nnently updating the database if needed. Conversely, if one or more of the participating databases or the coordinator have a not OK  response, the \\ntransaction has failed, and the coordinator sends a message to roll back  or \\nUNDO  the local effect of the transaction to each participating database. This \\nis done by undoing the local transaction operations, using the log.\\nThe net effect of the two-phase commit protocol is that either all participating data-\\nbases commit the effect of the transaction or none of them do. In case any of the participants—or the coordinator—fails, it is always possible to recover to a state where either the transaction is committed or it is rolled back. A failure during or before phase 1 usually requires the transaction to be rolled back, whereas a failure during phase 2 means that a successful transaction can recover and commit.\\n22.7  Database Backup and Recovery  \\nfrom Catastrophic Failures\\nSo far, all the techniques we have discussed apply to noncatastrophic failures. A key \\nassumption has been that the system log is maintained on the disk and is not lost as \\na result of the failure. Similarly, the shadow directory must be stored on disk to \\nallow recovery when shadow paging is used. The recovery techniques we have dis-\\ncussed use the entries in the system log or the shadow directory to recover from failure by bringing the database back to a consistent state.\\nThe recovery manager of a DBMS must also be equipped to handle more catastrophic \\nfailures such as disk crashes. The main technique used to handle such crashes is a database backup , in which the whole database and the log are periodically copied \\nonto a cheap storage medium such as magnetic tapes or other large capacity offline storage devices. In case of a catastrophic system failure, the latest backup copy can be reloaded from the tape to the disk, and the system can be restarted.\\nData from critical applications such as banking, insurance, stock market, and other \\ndatabases is periodically backed up in its entirety and moved to physically separate safe locations. Subterranean storage vaults have been used to protect such data from flood, storm, earthquake, or fire damage. Events like the 9/11 terrorist attack in New York (in 2001) and the Katrina hurricane disaster in New Orleans (in 2005) have created a greater awareness of disaster recovery of critical databases .\\nTo avoid losing all the effects of transactions that have been executed since the last \\nbackup, it is customary to back up the system log at more frequent intervals than full database backup by periodically copying it to magnetic tape. The system log is usu-ally substantially smaller than the database itself and hence can be backed up more frequently. Therefore, users do not lose all transactions they have performed since the last database backup. All committed transactions recorded in the portion of the system log that has been backed up to tape can have their effect on the database'),\n",

Hence, to recover from disk \\nfailure, the database is first recreated on disk from its latest backup copy on tape. Fol-lowing that, the effects of all the committed transactions whose operations have been recorded in the backed-up copies of the system log are reconstructed.\\n22.8 Summary\\nIn this chapter, we discussed the techniques for recovery from transaction failures. The main goal of recovery is to ensure the atomicity property of a transaction. If a transaction fails before completing its execution, the recovery mechanism has to make sure that the transaction has no lasting effects on the database. First in Sec-tion\\xa022.1 we gave an informal outline for a recovery process, and then we discussed system concepts for recovery. These included a discussion of caching, in-place updating versus shadowing, before and after images of a data item, \\nUNDO  versus \\nREDO  recovery operations, steal/no-steal and force/no-force policies, system check-\\npointing, and the write-ahead logging protocol.\\nNext we discussed two different approaches to recovery: deferred update (Sec-\\ntion\\xa0 22.2) and immediate update (Section 22.3). Deferred update techniques  postpone any actual updating of the database on disk until a transaction reaches its commit point. The transaction force-writes the log to disk before recording the updates in the database. This approach, when used with certain concurrency  control methods, is designed never to require transaction rollback, and recovery simply consists of redoing the operations of transactions committed after the last \\ncheckpoint from the log. The disadvantage is that too much buffer space may be \\nneeded, since updates are kept in the buffers and are not applied to disk until a \\ntrans action commits. Deferred update can lead to a recovery algorithm known as \\nNO-UNDO /REDO . Immediate update techniques may apply changes to the database \\non disk before the transaction reaches a successful conclusion. Any changes applied \\nto the database must first be recorded in the log and force-written to disk so that \\nthese operations can be undone if necessary. We also gave an overview of a recovery algorithm for immediate update known as \\nUNDO /REDO . Another algorithm, \\nknown as UNDO /NO-REDO , can also be developed for immediate update if all trans-\\naction actions are recorded in the database before commit.\\nWe discussed the shadow paging technique for recovery in Section 22.4, which \\nkeeps track of old database pages by using a shadow directory. This technique, \\nwhich is classified as NO-UNDO/NO-REDO , does not require a log in single-user sys-\\ntems but still needs the log for multiuser systems. We also presented ARIES in Sec-\\ntion 22.5, which is a specific recovery scheme used in many of IBM’s relational \\ndatabase products. Then in Section 22.6 we discussed the two-phase commit proto-\\ncol, which is used for recovery from failures involving multidatabase transactions. Finally, we discussed recovery from catastrophic failures in Section 22.7, which is typically done by backing up the database and the log to tape.

Distributed databases bring the advantages of distributed computing to the database domain. A distributed computing system  \\nconsists of a number of processing sites or nodes that are interconnected by a com-puter network and that cooperate in performing certain assigned tasks. As a general goal, distributed computing systems partition a big, unmanageable problem into smaller pieces and solve it efficiently in a coordinated manner. Thus, more comput-ing power is harnessed to solve a complex task, and the autonomous processing nodes can be managed independently while they cooperate to provide the needed functionalities to solve the problem. DDB technology resulted from a merger of two technologies: database technology and distributed systems technology.\\nSeveral distributed database prototype systems were developed in the 1980s and \\n1990s to address the issues of data distribution, data replication, distributed query and transaction processing, distributed database metadata management, and other topics. More recently, many new technologies have emerged that combine distrib-uted and database technologies. These technologies and systems are being devel-oped for dealing with the storage, analysis, and mining of the vast amounts of data that are being produced and collected, and they are referred to generally as big data \\ntechnologies . The origins of big data technologies come from distributed systems \\nand database systems, as well as data mining and machine learning algorithms that can process these vast amounts of data to extract needed knowledge.\\nIn this chapter, we discuss the concepts that are central to data distribution and the \\nmanagement of distributed data. Then in the following two chapters, we give an overview of some of the new technologies that have emerged to manage and process big data. Chapter 24 discusses the new class of database systems known as NOSQL chapter 23'),\n",

Chapter 25 introduces the concepts and systems being used for pro-cessing and analysis of big data, such as map-reduce and other distributed process-ing technologies. We also discuss cloud computing concepts in Chapter 25.\\nSection 23.1 introduces distributed database management and related concepts. \\nIssues of distributed database design, involving fragmenting and sharding of data \\nand distributing it over multiple sites, as well as data replication, are discussed in Section 23.2. Section 23.3 gives an overview of concurrency control and recovery in distributed databases. Sections 23.4 and  23.5 introduce distributed transaction pro-cessing and distributed query processing techniques, respectively. Sections 23.6 and  23.7 introduce different types of distributed database systems and their architec-tures, including federated and multidatabase systems. The problems of heterogene-ity and the needs of autonomy in federated database systems are also highlighted. Section 23.8 discusses catalog management schemes in distributed databases. Sec-tion 23.9 summarizes the chapter.\\nFor a short introduction to the topic of distributed databases, Sections 23.1 through  \\n23.5 may be covered and the other sections may be omitted.\\n23.1 Distributed Database Concepts\\nWe can define a distributed database (DDB)  as a collection of multiple logically \\ninterrelated databases distributed over a computer network, and a distributed \\ndatabase management system (DDBMS)  as a software system that manages a dis-\\ntributed database while making the distribution transparent to the user.\\n23.1.1 What Constitutes a DDB\\nFor a database to be called distributed, the following minimum conditions should be satisfied:\\n ■Connection of database nodes over a computer network.  There are mul-\\ntiple computers, called sites  or nodes . These sites must be connected by an \\nunderlying network  to transmit data and commands among sites.\\n ■Logical interrelation of the connected databases.  It is essential that the \\ninformation in the various database nodes be logically related.\\n ■Possible absence of homogeneity among connected nodes.  It is not neces-\\nsary that all nodes be identical in terms of data, hardware, and software.\\nThe sites may all be located in physical proximity—say, within the same building or a \\ngroup of adjacent buildings—and connected via a local area network , or they may be \\ngeographically distributed over large distances and connected via a long-haul  or wide \\narea network . Local area networks typically use wireless hubs or cables, whereas \\nlong-haul networks use telephone lines, cables, wireless communication infrastruc-\\ntures, or satellites. It is common to have a combination of various types of networks.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 873}, page_content='23.1 Distributed Database Concepts  843\\nNetworks may have different topologies  that define the direct communication \\npaths among sites. The type and topology of the network used may have a signifi-cant impact on the performance and hence on the strategies for distributed query processing and distributed database design. For high-level architectural issues, however, it does not matter what type of network is used; what matters is that each site be able to communicate, directly or indirectly, with every other site. For the remainder of this chapter, we assume that some type of network exists among nodes, regardless of any particular topology. We will not address any network- specific issues, although it is important to understand that for an efficient operation of a distributed database system (DDBS), network design and performance issues are critical and are an integral part of the overall solution. The details of the under-lying network are invisible to the end user.\\n23.1.2 Transparency\\nThe concept of transparency extends the general idea of hiding implementation details from end users. A highly transparent system offers a lot of flexibility to the end user/application developer since it requires little or no awareness of underly-ing details on their part. In the case of a traditional centralized database, transpar-ency simply pertains to logical and physical data independence for application developers. However, in a DDB scenario, the data and software are distributed over multiple nodes connected by a computer network, so additional types of transparencies are introduced.\\nConsider the company database in Figure 5.5 that we have been discussing through-\\nout the book. The \\nEMPLOYEE , PROJECT , and WORKS_ON  tables may be fragmented \\nhorizontally (that is, into sets of rows, as we will discuss in Section 23.2) and stored \\nwith possible replication, as shown in Figure 23.1. The following types of transpar-\\nencies are possible:\\n ■Data organization transparency (also known as distribution  or network \\ntransparency ). This refers to freedom for the user from the operational \\ndetails of the network and the placement of the data in the distributed sys-\\ntem. It may be divided into location transparency and naming transparency. \\nLocation transparency  refers to the fact that the command used to perform \\na task is independent of the location of the data and the location of the node where the command was issued. Naming transparency  implies that once a \\nname is associated with an object, the named objects can be accessed unam-biguously without additional specification as to where the data is located.\\n ■Replication transparency.  As we show in Figure 23.1, copies of the same \\ndata objects may be stored at multiple sites for better availability, perfor-\\nmance, and reliability. Replication transparency makes the user unaware of \\nthe existence of these copies.\\n ■Fragmentation transparency.  Two types of fragmentation are possible. \\nHorizontal fragmentation  distributes a relation (table) into subrelations \\nthat are subsets of the tuples (rows) in the original relation; this is also known'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 874}, page_content='844 Chapter 23 Distributed Database Concepts\\nas sharding  in the newer big data and cloud computing systems. Vertical \\nfragmentation  distributes a relation into subrelations where each subrelation \\nis defined by a subset of the columns of the original relation. Fragmentation transparency makes the user unaware of the existence of fragments.\\n ■Other transparencies include design transparency  and execution \\n transparency —which refer, respectively, to freedom from knowing how the \\ndistributed database is designed and where a transaction executes.\\n23.1.3 Availability and Reliability\\nReliability and availability are two of the most common potential advantages cited for distributed databases. Reliability  is broadly defined as the probability that a \\nsystem is running (not down) at a certain time point, whereas availability  is the \\nprobability that the system is continuously available during a time interval. We can directly relate reliability and availability of the database to the faults, errors, and failures associated with it. A failure can be described as a deviation of a system’s behavior from that which is specified in order to ensure correct execution of opera-tions. Errors  constitute that subset of system states that causes the failure. Fault  is \\nthe cause of an error.\\nTo construct a system that is reliable, we can adopt several approaches. One com-\\nmon approach stresses fault tolerance ; it recognizes that faults will occur, and it \\ndesigns mechanisms that can detect and remove faults before they can result in a EMPLOYEES \\nPROJECTS \\nWORKS_ON All\\nAll\\nAllEMPLOYEES\\nPROJECTS\\nWORKS_ONSan Francisco \\nand Los Angeles\\nSan Francisco\\nSan Francisco \\nemployees\\nEMPLOYEES \\nPROJECTS\\nWORKS_ONLos Angeles\\nLos Angeles and \\nSan Francisco\\nLos Angeles \\nemployeesEMPLOYEES\\nPROJECTS\\nWORKS_ONNew York\\nAll\\nNew York \\nemployees\\nEMPLOYEES \\nPROJECTS WORKS_ONAtlanta\\nAtlantaAtlanta \\nemployeesChicago\\n(Headquarters)\\nNew York\\nLos Angeles AtlantaSan Francisco\\nCommunications\\nNetwork\\nFigure 23.1 Data distribution and replication among distributed databases.'),\n",

Another more stringent approach attempts to ensure that the final \\nsystem does not contain any faults. This is done through an exhaustive design pro-cess followed by extensive quality control and testing. A reliable DDBMS tolerates failures of underlying components, and it processes user requests as long as data-base consistency is not violated. A DDBMS recovery manager has to deal with fail-ures arising from transactions, hardware, and communication networks. Hardware failures can either be those that result in loss of main memory contents or loss of secondary storage contents. Network failures occur due to errors associated with messages and line failures. Message errors can include their loss, corruption, or out-of-order arrival at destination.\\nThe previous definitions are used in computer systems in general, where there is a \\ntechnical distinction between reliability and availability. In most discussions related to DDB, the term availability  is used generally as an umbrella term to cover both \\nconcepts.\\n23.1.4 Scalability and Partition Tolerance\\nScalability  determines the extent to which the system can expand its capacity while \\ncontinuing to operate without interruption. There are two types of scalability:\\n  1. Horizontal scalability:  This refers to expanding the number of nodes in the \\ndistributed system. As nodes are added to the system, it should be possible to distribute some of the data and processing loads from existing nodes to the new nodes.\\n  2. Vertical scalability:  This refers to expanding the capacity of the individual \\nnodes in the system, such as expanding the storage capacity or the process-ing power of a node.\\nAs the system expands its number of nodes, it is possible that the network, which \\nconnects the nodes, may have faults that cause the nodes to be partitioned into groups of nodes. The nodes within each partition are still connected by a subnet-work, but communication among the partitions is lost. The concept of partition \\ntolerance  states that the system should have the capacity to continue operating \\nwhile the network is partitioned.\\n23.1.5 Autonomy\\nAutonomy  determines the extent to which individual nodes or DBs in a connected \\nDDB can operate independently. A high degree of autonomy is desirable for \\nincreased flexibility and customized maintenance of an individual node. Autonomy \\ncan be applied to design, communication, and execution. Design autonomy  refers \\nto independence of data model usage and transaction management techniques among nodes. Communication autonomy  determines the extent to which each \\nnode can decide on sharing of information with other nodes. Execution autonomy  \\nrefers to independence of users to act as they please.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 876}, page_content='846 Chapter 23 Distributed Database Concepts\\n23.1.6 Advantages of Distributed Databases\\nSome important advantages of DDB are listed below.\\n  1. Improved ease and flexibility of application development . Developing \\nand maintaining applications at geographically distributed sites of an organization is facilitated due to transparency of data distribution and control.\\n  2. Increased availability.  This is achieved by the isolation of faults to their \\nsite of origin without affecting the other database nodes connected to the network. When the data and DDBMS software are distributed over many sites, one site may fail while other sites continue to operate. Only the data and software that exist at the failed site cannot be accessed. Further improvement is achieved by judiciously replicating data and software at more than one site. In a centralized system, failure at a single site makes the whole system unavailable to all users. In a distributed database, some of the data may be unreachable, but users may still be able to access other parts of the database. If the data in the failed site has been replicated at another site prior to the failure, then the user will not be affected at all. The ability of the system to survive network partitioning also contributes to high availability.\\n  3. Improved performance.  A distributed DBMS fragments the database \\nby keeping the data closer to where it is needed most. Data localization  \\nreduces the contention for CPU and I/O services and simultaneously reduces access delays involved in wide area networks. When a large database is distributed over multiple sites, smaller databases exist at each site. As a result, local queries and transactions accessing data at a single site have better performance because of the smaller local data-bases. In addition, each site has a smaller number of transactions exe-cuting than if all transactions are submitted to a single centralized database. Moreover, interquery and intraquery parallelism can be achieved by executing multiple queries at different sites, or by breaking up a query into a number of subqueries that execute in parallel. This contributes to improved performance.\\n  4. Easier expansion via scalability . In a distributed environment, expansion \\nof the system in terms of adding more data, increasing database sizes, or adding more nodes is much easier than in centralized (non-distributed) systems.\\nThe transparencies we discussed in Section 23.1.2 lead to a compromise between \\nease of use and the overhead cost of providing transparency. Total transparency provides the global user with a view of the entire DDBS as if it is a single centralized system. Transparency is provided as a complement to autonomy , which gives the \\nusers tighter control over local databases. Transparency features may be imple-mented as a part of the user language, which may translate the required services into appropriate operations.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 877}, page_content='23.2 Data Fragmentation, Replication, and Allocation Techniques for Distributed Database Design  847\\n23.2  Data Fragmentation, Replication,  \\nand Allocation Techniques for Distributed Database Design\\nIn this section, we discuss techniques that are used to break up the database into \\nlogical units, called fragments , which may be assigned for storage at the various \\nnodes. We also discuss the use of data replication , which permits certain data to be \\nstored in more than one site to increase availability and reliability; and the process of allocating  fragments—or replicas of fragments—for storage at the various nodes. \\nThese techniques are used during the process of distributed database design . The \\ninformation concerning data fragmentation, allocation, and replication is stored in a global directory  that is accessed by the DDBS applications as needed.\\n23.2.1 Data Fragmentation and Sharding\\nIn a DDB, decisions must be made regarding which site should be used to store \\nwhich portions of the database. For now, we will assume that there is no replication ; \\nthat is, each relation—or portion of a relation—is stored at one site only. We dis-cuss replication and its effects later in this section. We also use the terminology of relational databases, but similar concepts apply to other data models. We assume that we are starting with a relational database schema and must decide on how to distribute the relations over the various sites. To illustrate our discussion, we use the relational database schema shown in Figure 5.5.\\nBefore we decide on how to distribute the data, we must determine the logical units  of \\nthe database that are to be distributed. The simplest logical units are the relations themselves; that is, each whole  relation is to be stored at a particular site. In our exam-\\nple, we must decide on a site to store each of the relations \\nEMPLOYEE , DEPARTMENT , \\nPROJECT , WORKS_ON , and DEPENDENT  in Figure 5.5. In many cases, however, a \\nrelation can be divided into smaller logical units for distribution. For example, consider the company database shown in Figure 5.6, and assume there are three computer sites—one for each department in the company.\\n1 \\nWe may want to store the database information relating to each department at the computer site for that department. A technique called horizontal fragmentation  or \\nsharding  can be used to partition each relation by department.\\nHorizontal Fragmentation (Sharding). A horizontal fragment  or shard  of a \\nrelation is a subset of the tuples in that relation. The tuples that belong to the horizontal fragment can be specified by a condition on one or more attributes of the relation, or by some other mechanism. Often, only a single attribute is involved in the condition. For example, we may define three horizontal fragments on the \\nEMPLOYEE  relation in \\nFigure 5.6 with the following conditions: ( Dno = 5), ( Dno = 4), and ( Dno = 1)—each \\n1Of course, in an actual situation, there will be many more tuples in the relation than those shown in \\nFigure 5.6.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 878}, page_content='848 Chapter 23 Distributed Database Concepts\\nfragment contains the EMPLOYEE  tuples working for a particular department. Sim-\\nilarly, we may define three horizontal fragments for the PROJECT  relation, with the \\nconditions ( Dnum  = 5), ( Dnum  = 4), and ( Dnum  = 1)—each fragment contains the \\nPROJECT  tuples controlled by a particular department. Horizontal fragmentation  \\ndivides a relation horizontally  by grouping rows to create subsets of tuples, where \\neach subset has a certain logical meaning. These fragments can then be assigned to different sites (nodes) in the distributed system. Derived horizontal  fragmentation  \\napplies the partitioning of a primary relation (\\nDEPARTMENT  in our example) to \\nother secondary relations ( EMPLOYEE  and PROJECT  in our example), which are \\nrelated to the primary via a foreign key. Thus, related data between the primary and the secondary relations gets fragmented in the same way.\\nVertical Fragmentation. Each site may not need all the attributes of a relation, \\nwhich would indicate the need for a different type of fragmentation. Vertical \\n fragmentation  divides a relation “vertically” by columns. A vertical fragment  of a \\nrelation keeps only certain attributes of the relation. For example, we may want to \\nfragment the \\nEMPLOYEE  relation into two vertical fragments. The first fragment \\nincludes personal information— Name , Bdate , Address , and Sex—and the second \\nincludes work-related information— Ssn, Salary , Super_ssn , and Dno. This vertical \\nfragmentation is not quite proper, because if the two fragments are stored sepa-\\nrately, we cannot put the original employee tuples back together since there is no \\ncommon attribute  between the two fragments. It is necessary to include the primary \\nkey or some unique key attribute in every  vertical fragment so that the full relation \\ncan be reconstructed from the fragments. Hence, we must add the Ssn attribute to \\nthe personal information fragment.\\nNotice that each horizontal fragment on a relation R can be specified in the rela-\\ntional algebra by a σCi(R) (select) operation. A set of horizontal fragments whose \\nconditions C1, C2, … , Cn include all the tuples in R—that is, every tuple in R satis-\\nfies ( C1 OR C2 OR … OR Cn)—is called a complete horizontal fragmentation  of R. \\nIn many cases a complete horizontal fragmentation is also disjoint ; that is, no tuple \\nin R satisfies ( Ci AND  Cj) for any i ≠ j. Our two earlier examples of horizontal frag-\\nmentation for the EMPLOYEE  and PROJECT  relations were both complete and dis-\\njoint. To reconstruct the relation R from a complete  horizontal fragmentation, we \\nneed to apply the UNION  operation to the fragments.\\nA vertical fragment on a relation R can be specified by a πLi(R) operation in the \\nrelational algebra. A set of vertical fragments whose projection lists L1, L2, … , Ln \\ninclude all the attributes in R but share only the primary key attribute of R is called \\na complete vertical fragmentation  of R. In this case the projection lists satisfy the \\nfollowing two conditions:\\n ■L1 ∪ L2 ∪ … ∪ Ln = ATTRS (R)\\n ■Li ∩ Lj = PK(R) for any i ≠ j, where ATTRS (R) is the set of attributes of R and \\nPK(R) is the primary key of R\\nTo reconstruct the relation R from a complete  vertical fragmentation, we apply \\nthe OUTER UNION  operation to the vertical fragments (assuming no horizontal'),\n",

Notice that we could also apply a FULL OUTER JOIN  opera-\\ntion and get the same result for a complete vertical fragmentation, even when some horizontal fragmentation may also have been applied. The two vertical frag-ments of the \\nEMPLOYEE  relation with projection lists L1 = {Ssn, Name , Bdate , \\nAddress , Sex} and L2 = {Ssn, Salary , Super_ssn , Dno} constitute a complete vertical \\nfragmentation of EMPLOYEE .\\nTwo horizontal fragments that are neither complete nor disjoint are those defined on \\nthe EMPLOYEE  relation in Figure 5.5 by the conditions ( Salary  > 50000) and ( Dno = 4); \\nthey may not include all EMPLOYEE  tuples, and they may include common tuples. \\nTwo vertical fragments that are not complete are those defined by the attribute lists L\\n1 = {Name , Address } and L2 = {Ssn, Name , Salary }; these lists violate both conditions \\nof a complete vertical fragmentation.\\nMixed (Hybrid) Fragmentation. We can intermix the two types of fragmenta-\\ntion, yielding a mixed fragmentation . For example, we may combine the horizon-\\ntal and vertical fragmentations of the EMPLOYEE  relation given earlier into a mixed \\nfragmentation that includes six fragments. In this case, the original relation can be \\nreconstructed by applying UNION  and OUTER UNION  (or OUTER JOIN ) operations \\nin the appropriate order. In general, a fragment  of a relation R can be specified by a \\nSELECT-PROJECT  combination of operations πL(σC(R)). If C = TRUE  (that is, all \\ntuples are selected) and L ≠ ATTRS (R), we get a vertical fragment, and if C ≠ TRUE  and \\nL = ATTRS (R), we get a horizontal fragment. Finally, if C ≠ TRUE  and L\\xa0≠\\xa0ATTRS (R), \\nwe get a mixed fragment. Notice that a relation can itself be considered a fragment \\nwith C = TRUE  and L = ATTRS (R). In the following discussion, the term fragment  is \\nused to refer to a relation or to any of the preceding types of fragments.\\nA fragmentation schema  of a database is a definition of a set of fragments that includes \\nall attributes and tuples in the database and satisfies the condition that the whole data-\\nbase can be reconstructed from the fragments by applying some sequence of OUTER \\nUNION  (or OUTER JOIN ) and UNION  operations. It is also sometimes useful— although \\nnot necessary—to have all the fragments be disjoint except for the repetition of pri-mary keys among vertical (or mixed) fragments. In the latter case, all replication and distribution of fragments is clearly specified at a subsequent stage, separately from fragmentation.\\nAn allocation schema  describes the allocation of fragments to nodes (sites) of the \\nDDBS; hence, it is a mapping that specifies for each fragment the site(s) at which it is stored. If a fragment is stored at more than one site, it is said to be replicated . We \\ndiscuss data replication and allocation next.\\n23.2.2 Data Replication and Allocation\\nReplication is useful in improving the availability of data. The most extreme case is replication of the whole database  at every site in the distributed system, thus creat-\\ning a fully replicated distributed database . This can improve availability remark-\\nably because the system can continue to operate as long as at least one site is up. It'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 880}, page_content='850 Chapter 23 Distributed Database Concepts\\nalso improves performance of retrieval (read performance) for global queries \\nbecause the results of such queries can be obtained locally from any one site; hence, a retrieval query can be processed at the local site where it is submitted, if that site includes a server module. The disadvantage of full replication is that it can slow down update operations (write performance) drastically, since a single logical update must be performed on every copy  of the database to keep the copies consis-\\ntent. This is especially true if many copies of the database exist. Full replication makes the concurrency control and recovery techniques more expensive than they would be if there was no replication, as we will see in Section 23.3.\\nThe other extreme from full replication involves having no replication —that is, \\neach fragment is stored at exactly one site. In this case, all fragments must be  dis-\\njoint, except for the repetition of primary keys among vertical (or mixed) frag-ments. This is also called nonredundant allocation .\\nBetween these two extremes, we have a wide spectrum of partial replication  of \\nthe data—that is, some fragments of the database may be replicated whereas oth-ers may not. The number of copies of each fragment can range from one up to the total number of sites in the distributed system. A special case of partial repli-cation is occurring heavily in applications where mobile workers—such as sales forces, financial planners, and claims adjustors—carry partially replicated data-bases with them on laptops and PDAs and synchronize them periodically with the server database. A description of the replication of fragments is sometimes called a replication schema .\\nEach fragment—or each copy of a fragment—must be assigned to a particular site in \\nthe distributed system. This process is called data distribution  (or data  allocation ). \\nThe choice of sites and the degree of replication depend on the performance and availability goals of the system and on the types and frequencies of transactions submitted at each site. For example, if high availability is required, transactions can be submitted at any site, and most transactions are retrieval only, a fully replicated database is a good choice. However, if certain transactions that access particular parts of the database are mostly submitted at a particular site, the corresponding set of fragments can be allocated at that site only. Data that is accessed at multiple sites \\ncan be replicated at those sites. If many updates are performed, it may be useful to \\nlimit replication. Finding an optimal or even a good solution to distributed data allocation is a complex optimization problem.\\n23.2.3 Example of Fragmentation, Allocation, and Replication\\nWe now consider an example of fragmenting and distributing the company data-base in Figures 5.5 and  5.6. Suppose that the company has three computer sites—\\none for each current department. Sites 2 and 3 are for departments 5 and 4, \\nrespectively. At each of these sites, we expect frequent access to the \\nEMPLOYEE  and \\nPROJECT  information for the employees who work in that department  and the \\nprojects controlled by that department.  Further, we assume that these sites mainly \\naccess the Name , Ssn, Salary , and Super_ssn  attributes of EMPLOYEE . Site 1 is used'),\n",

To determine the fragments to be replicated at sites 2 and 3, first we can horizontally fragment \\nDEPARTMENT  by its key Dnumber . Then we apply derived \\nfragmentation to the EMPLOYEE , PROJECT , and DEPT_LOCATIONS  relations based \\non their foreign keys for department number—called Dno, Dnum , and Dnumber , \\nrespectively, in Figure 5.5. We can vertically fragment the resulting EMPLOYEE  \\nfragments to include only the attributes { Name , Ssn, Salary , Super_ssn , Dno}. \\n Figure\\xa023.2 shows the mixed fragments EMPD_5  and EMPD_4 , which include the \\nEMPLOYEE  tuples satisfying the conditions Dno = 5 and Dno = 4, respectively. The \\nhorizontal fragments of PROJECT , DEPARTMENT , and DEPT_LOCATIONS  are \\n similarly fragmented by department number. All these fragments—stored at sites 2\\xa0and 3—are replicated because they are also stored at headquarters—site 1.\\nWe must now fragment the \\nWORKS_ON  relation and decide which fragments of \\nWORKS_ON  to store at sites 2 and 3. We are confronted with the problem that no \\nattribute of WORKS_ON  directly indicates the department to which each tuple \\nbelongs. In fact, each tuple in WORKS_ON  relates an employee e to a project P. We \\ncould fragment WORKS_ON  based on the department D in which e works or based \\non the department D′ that controls P. Fragmentation becomes easy if we have a \\nconstraint stating that D = D′ for all WORKS_ON  tuples—that is, if employees can \\nwork only on projects controlled by the department they work for. However, there is no such constraint in our database in Figure 5.6. For example, the \\nWORKS_ON  \\ntuple <333445555, 10, 10.0> relates an employee who works for department 5 with a project controlled by department 4. In this case, we could fragment \\nWORKS_ON  \\nbased on the department in which the employee works (which is expressed by the condition C) and then fragment further based on the department that controls the \\nprojects that employee is working on, as shown in Figure 23.3.\\nIn Figure 23.3, the union of fragments G\\n1, G2, and G3 gives all WORKS_ON  tuples \\nfor employees who work for department 5. Similarly, the union of fragments G4, G5, \\nand G6 gives all WORKS_ON  tuples for employees who work for department 4. On \\nthe other hand, the union of fragments G1, G4, and G7 gives all WORKS_ON  tuples \\nfor projects controlled by department 5. The condition for each of the fragments G1 \\nthrough G9 is shown in Figure 23.3. The relations that represent M:N relationships, \\nsuch as WORKS_ON , often have several possible logical fragmentations. In our distri-\\nbution in Figure 23.2, we choose to include all fragments that can be joined to either an \\nEMPLOYEE  tuple or a PROJECT  tuple at sites 2 and 3. Hence, we place the union of \\nfragments G1, G2, G3, G4, and G7 at site 2 and the union of fragments G4, G5, G6, G2, \\nand G8 at site 3. Notice that fragments G2 and G4 are replicated at both sites. This allo-\\ncation strategy permits the join between the local EMPLOYEE  or PROJECT  fragments at \\nsite 2 or site 3 and the local WORKS_ON  fragment to be performed completely locally. \\nThis clearly demonstrates how complex the problem of database fragmentation and \\nallocation is for large databases. The Selected Bibliography at the end of this chapter \\ndiscusses some of the work done in this area.'),\n",

These include the following:\\n ■Dealing with multiple copies  of the data items.  The concurrency control \\nmethod is responsible for maintaining consistency among these copies. The recovery method is responsible for making a copy consistent with other cop-ies if the site on which the copy is stored fails and recovers later.\\n ■Failure of individual sites.  The DDBMS should continue to operate with its \\nrunning sites, if possible, when one or more individual sites fail. When a site recovers, its local database must be brought up-to-date with the rest of the sites before it rejoins the system.\\n ■Failure of communication links.  The system must be able to deal with the \\nfailure of one or more of the communication links that connect the sites. An extreme case of this problem is that network partitioning  may occur. This \\nbreaks up the sites into two or more partitions, where the sites within each partition can communicate only with one another and not with sites in other partitions.\\n ■Distributed commit.  Problems can arise with committing a transaction \\nthat is accessing databases stored on multiple sites if some sites fail during the commit process. The two-phase commit protocol  (see Section 21.6) is \\noften used to deal with this problem.\\n ■Distributed deadlock.  Deadlock may occur among several sites, so \\ntechniques for dealing with deadlocks must be extended to take this into account.\\nDistributed concurrency control and recovery techniques must deal with these \\nand other problems. In the following subsections, we review some of the tech-niques that have been suggested to deal with recovery and concurrency control in DDBMSs.\\n23.3.1  Distributed Concurrency Control Based  \\non a Distinguished Copy of a Data Item\\nTo deal with replicated data items in a distributed database, a number of concur-\\nrency control methods have been proposed that extend the concurrency control techniques that are used in centralized databases. We discuss these techniques in the context of extending centralized locking.  Similar extensions apply to other con-\\ncurrency control techniques. The idea is to designate a particular copy  of each data \\nitem as a distinguished copy . The locks for this data item are associated with the \\ndistinguished copy,  and all locking and unlocking requests are sent to the site that \\ncontains that copy.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 885}, page_content='23.3 Overview of Concurrency Control and Recovery in Distributed Databases  855\\nA number of different methods are based on this idea, but they differ in their \\nmethod of choosing the distinguished copies. In the primary site technique , all \\ndistinguished copies are kept at the same site. A modification of this approach is the primary site with a backup site . Another approach is the primary copy  \\nmethod, where the distinguished copies of the various data items can be stored in different sites. A site that includes a distinguished copy of a data item basically acts as the coordinator site  for concurrency control on that item. We discuss these \\ntechniques next.\\nPrimary Site Technique. In this method, a single primary site  is designated to be \\nthe coordinator site  for all database items.  Hence, all locks are kept at that site, and \\nall requests for locking or unlocking are sent there. This method is thus an exten-\\nsion of the centralized locking approach. For example, if all transactions follow the \\ntwo-phase locking protocol, serializability is guaranteed. The advantage of this approach is that it is a simple extension of the centralized approach and thus is not overly complex. However, it has certain inherent disadvantages. One is that all locking requests are sent to a single site, possibly overloading that site and causing a system bottleneck. A second disadvantage is that failure of the primary site para-lyzes the system, since all locking information is kept at that site. This can limit system reliability and availability.\\nAlthough all locks are accessed at the primary site, the items themselves can be accessed \\nat any site at which they reside. For example, once a transaction obtains a \\nRead_lock  on \\na data item from the primary site, it can access any copy of that data item. However, once a transaction obtains a \\nWrite_lock  and updates a data item, the DDBMS is respon-\\nsible for updating all copies  of the data item before releasing the lock.\\nPrimary Site with Backup Site. This approach addresses the second disadvan-\\ntage of the primary site method by designating a second site to be a backup site . All \\nlocking information is maintained at both the primary and the backup sites. In case of primary site failure, the backup site takes over as the primary site, and a new backup site is chosen. This simplifies the process of recovery from failure of the primary site, since the backup site takes over and processing can resume after a new backup site is chosen and the lock status information is copied to that site. It slows down the process of acquiring locks, however, because all lock requests and grant-ing of locks must be recorded at both the primary and the backup sites  before a \\nresponse is sent to the requesting transaction. The problem of the primary and backup sites becoming overloaded with requests and slowing down the system remains undiminished.\\nPrimary Copy Technique. This method attempts to distribute the load of lock \\ncoordination among various sites by having the distinguished copies of different data items stored at different sites.  Failure of one site affects any transactions that \\nare accessing locks on items whose primary copies reside at that site, but other transactions are not affected. This method can also use backup sites to enhance reli-ability and availability.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 886}, page_content='856 Chapter 23 Distributed Database Concepts\\nChoosing a New Coordinator Site in Case of Failure. Whenever a coordina-\\ntor site fails in any of the preceding techniques, the sites that are still running must choose a new coordinator. In the case of the primary site approach with no backup \\nsite, all executing transactions must be aborted and restarted in a tedious recovery process. Part of the recovery process involves choosing a new primary site and cre-ating a lock manager process and a record of all lock information at that site. For methods that use backup sites, transaction processing is suspended while the backup site is designated as the new primary site and a new backup site is chosen and is sent copies of all the locking information from the new primary site.\\nIf a backup site X is about to become the new primary site, X can choose the new \\nbackup site from among the system’s running sites. However, if no backup site existed, or if both the primary and the backup sites are down, a process called election  can be used to choose the new coordinator site. In this process, any site Y \\nthat attempts to communicate with the coordinator site repeatedly and fails to do so \\ncan assume that the coordinator is down and can start the election process by send-ing a message to all running sites proposing that Y become the new coordinator. As \\nsoon as Y receives a majority of yes votes, Y can declare that it is the new coordina-\\ntor. The election algorithm itself is complex, but this is the main idea behind the election method. The algorithm also resolves any attempt by two or more sites to become coordinator at the same time. The references in the Selected Bibliography at the end of this chapter discuss the process in detail.\\n23.3.2 Distributed Concurrency Control Based on Voting\\nThe concurrency control methods for replicated items discussed earlier all use the idea of a distinguished copy that maintains the locks for that item. In the voting \\nmethod , there is no distinguished copy; rather, a lock request is sent to all sites that \\nincludes a copy of the data item. Each copy maintains its own lock and can grant or deny the request for it. If a transaction that requests a lock is granted that lock by a \\nmajority  of the copies, it holds the lock and informs all copies  that it has been \\ngranted the lock. If a transaction does not receive a majority of votes granting it a lock within a certain time-out period,  it cancels its request and informs all sites of \\nthe cancellation.\\nThe voting method is considered a truly distributed concurrency control method, \\nsince the responsibility for a decision resides with all the sites involved. Simulation studies have shown that voting has higher message traffic among sites than do the distinguished copy methods. If the algorithm takes into account possible site fail-ures during the voting process, it becomes extremely complex.\\n23.3.3 Distributed Recovery\\nThe recovery process in distributed databases is quite involved. We give only a very brief idea of some of the issues here. In some cases it is difficult even to determine whether a site is down without exchanging numerous messages with other sites. For'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 887}, page_content='23.4 Overview of Transaction Management in Distributed Databases  857\\nexample, suppose that site X sends a message to site Y and expects a response from \\nY but does not receive it. There are several possible explanations:\\n ■The message was not delivered to Y because of communication failure.\\n ■Site Y is down and could not respond.\\n ■Site Y is running and sent a response, but the response was not delivered.\\nWithout additional information or the sending of additional messages, it is difficult \\nto determine what actually happened.\\nAnother problem with distributed recovery is distributed commit. When a transac-\\ntion is updating data at several sites, it cannot commit until it is sure that the effect of the transaction on every  site cannot be lost. This means that every site must first \\nhave recorded the local effects of the transactions permanently in the local site log on disk. The two-phase commit protocol is often used to ensure the correctness of distributed commit (see Section 21.6).\\n23.4  Overview of Transaction Management  \\nin Distributed Databases\\nThe global and local transaction management software modules, along with the \\nconcurrency control and recovery manager of a DDBMS, collectively guarantee the \\nACID properties of transactions (see Chapter 20).\\nAn additional component called the global transaction manager  is introduced for \\nsupporting distributed transactions. The site where the transaction originated can \\ntemporarily assume the role of global transaction manager and coordinate the exe-\\ncution of database operations with transaction managers across multiple sites. \\nTransaction managers export their functionality as an interface to the application programs. The operations exported by this interface are similar to those covered in Section 20.2.1, namely \\nBEGIN_TRANSACTION , READ  or WRITE , END_TRANSACTION , \\nCOMMIT_TRANSACTION , and ROLLBACK  (or ABORT ). The manager stores book-\\nkeeping information related to each transaction, such as a unique identifier, origi-\\nnating site, name, and so on. For READ  operations, it returns a local copy if valid and \\navailable. For WRITE  operations, it ensures that updates are visible across all sites \\ncontaining copies (replicas) of the data item. For ABORT  operations, the manager \\nensures that no effects of the transaction are reflected in any site of the distributed database. For \\nCOMMIT  operations, it ensures that the effects of a write are persistently \\nrecorded on all databases containing copies of the data item. Atomic termination \\n(COMMIT / ABORT ) of distributed transactions is commonly implemented using the \\ntwo-phase commit protocol (see Section 22.6).\\nThe transaction manager passes to the concurrency controller module the database \\noperations and associated information. The controller is responsible for acquisition \\nand release of associated locks. If the transaction requires access to a locked \\nresource, it is blocked until the lock is acquired. Once the lock is acquired, the oper-\\nation is sent to the runtime processor, which handles the actual execution of the'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 888}, page_content='858 Chapter 23 Distributed Database Concepts\\ndatabase operation. Once the operation is completed, locks are released and the \\ntransaction manager is updated with the result of the operation.\\n23.4.1 Two-Phase Commit Protocol\\nIn Section 22.6, we described the two-phase commit protocol  (2PC ), which requires \\na global recovery manager , or coordinator , to maintain information needed for \\nrecovery, in addition to the local recovery managers and the information they maintain (log, tables). The two-phase commit protocol has certain drawbacks that led to the development of the three-phase commit protocol, which we discuss next.\\n23.4.2 Three-Phase Commit Protocol\\nThe biggest drawback of 2PC is that it is a blocking protocol. Failure of the coordi-nator blocks all participating sites, causing them to wait until the coordinator recovers. This can cause performance degradation, especially if participants are holding locks to shared resources. Other types of problems may also occur that make the outcome of the transaction nondeterministic.\\nThese problems are solved by the three-phase commit (3PC) protocol, which essen-\\ntially divides the second commit phase into two subphases called prepare-to-commit  \\nand commit . The prepare-to-commit phase is used to communicate the result of \\nthe vote phase to all participants. If all participants vote yes, then the coordinator instructs them to move into the prepare-to-commit state. The commit subphase is identical to its two-phase counterpart. Now, if the coordinator crashes during this subphase, another participant can see the transaction through to completion. It can simply ask a crashed participant if it received a prepare-to-commit message. If it did not, then it safely assumes to abort. Thus the state of the protocol can be recov-ered irrespective of which participant crashes. Also, by limiting the time required for a transaction to commit or abort to a maximum time-out period, the protocol ensures that a transaction attempting to commit via 3PC releases locks on time-out.\\nThe main idea is to limit the wait time for participants who have prepared to com-\\nmit and are waiting for a global commit or abort from the coordinator. When a participant receives a precommit message, it knows that the rest of the participants have voted to commit. If a precommit message has not been received, then the par-ticipant will abort and release all locks.\\n23.4.3 Operating System Support for Transaction Management\\nThe following are the main benefits of operating system (OS)-supported transaction management:\\n ■Typically, DBMSs use their own semaphores2 to guarantee mutually exclu-\\nsive access to shared resources.

Hence if the OS deactivates a DBMS process hold-ing a lock, other DBMS processes wanting this locked resource get blocked. Such a situation can cause serious performance degradation. OS-level knowledge of semaphores can help eliminate such situations.\\n ■Specialized hardware support for locking can be exploited to reduce associ-\\nated costs. This can be of great importance, since locking is one of the most common DBMS operations.\\n ■Providing a set of common transaction support operations though the kernel \\nallows application developers to focus on adding new features to their prod-ucts as opposed to reimplementing the common functionality for each appli-cation. For example, if different DDBMSs are to coexist on the same machine and they chose the two-phase commit protocol, then it is more beneficial to have this protocol implemented as part of the kernel so that the DDBMS developers can focus more on adding new features to their products.\\n23.5  Query Processing and Optimization in  \\nDistributed Databases\\nNow we give an overview of how a DDBMS processes and optimizes a query. First \\nwe discuss the steps involved in query processing and then elaborate on the commu-nication costs of processing a distributed query. Then we discuss a special operation, called a semijoin,  which is used to optimize some types of queries in a DDBMS. A \\ndetailed discussion about optimization algorithms is beyond the scope of this text. We attempt to illustrate optimization principles using suitable examples.\\n3\\n23.5.1 Distributed Query Processing\\nA distributed database query is processed in stages as follows:\\n  1. Query Mapping.  The input query on distributed data is specified formally \\nusing a query language. It is then translated into an algebraic query on global \\nrelations. This translation is done by referring to the global conceptual \\nschema and does not take into account the actual distribution and replica-tion of data. Hence, this translation is largely identical to the one performed in a centralized DBMS. It is first normalized, analyzed for semantic errors, simplified, and finally restructured into an algebraic query.\\n  2. Localization.  In a distributed database, fragmentation results in relations \\nbeing stored in separate sites, with some fragments possibly being repli-\\ncated. This stage maps the distributed query on the global schema to sepa-\\nrate queries on individual fragments using data distribution and replication \\ninformation.\\n3For a detailed discussion of optimization algorithms, see Ozsu and Valduriez (1999).'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 890}, page_content='860 Chapter 23 Distributed Database Concepts\\n  3. Global Query Optimization.  Optimization consists of selecting a strategy \\nfrom a list of candidates that is closest to optimal. A list of candidate queries can be obtained by permuting the ordering of operations within a fragment query generated by the previous stage. Time is the preferred unit for mea-suring cost. The total cost is a weighted combination of costs such as CPU cost, I/O costs, and communication costs. Since DDBs are connected by a network, often the communication costs over the network are the most sig-nificant. This is especially true when the sites are connected through a wide area network (WAN).\\n  4. Local Query Optimization.  This stage is common to all sites in the DDB. \\nThe techniques are similar to those used in centralized systems.\\nThe first three stages discussed above are performed at a central control site, \\nwhereas the last stage is performed locally.\\n23.5.2 Data Transfer Costs of Distributed Query Processing\\nWe discussed the issues involved in processing and optimizing a query in a central-ized DBMS in Chapter 19. In a distributed system, several additional factors further complicate query processing. The first is the cost of transferring data over the net-work. This data includes intermediate files that are transferred to other sites for further processing, as well as the final result files that may have to be transferred to the site where the query result is needed. Although these costs may not be very high if the sites are connected via a high-performance local area network, they become significant in other types of networks. Hence, DDBMS query optimization algo-rithms consider the goal of reducing the amount of data transfer  as an optimization \\ncriterion in choosing a distributed query execution strategy.\\nWe illustrate this with two simple sample queries. Suppose that the \\nEMPLOYEE  and \\nDEPARTMENT  relations in Figure 3.5 are distributed at two sites as shown in Fig-\\nure\\xa023.4. We will assume in this example that neither relation is fragmented. Accord-ing to Figure 23.4, the size of the \\nEMPLOYEE  relation is 100 * 10,000 = 106 bytes, and \\nthe size of the DEPARTMENT  relation is 35 * 100 = 3,500 bytes. Consider the query Q: \\nFor each employee, retrieve the employee name and the name of the department for \\nwhich the employee works.  This can be stated as follows in the relational algebra:\\nQ: πFname,Lname,Dname (EMPLOYEE   Dno=Dnumber  DEPARTMENT )\\nThe result of this query will include 10,000 records, assuming that every employee \\nis related to a department. Suppose that each record in the query result is 40 bytes \\nlong.  The query is submitted at a distinct site 3, which is called the result site  \\nbecause the query result is needed there. Neither the EMPLOYEE  nor the \\n DEPARTMENT  relations reside at site 3. There are three simple strategies for execut-\\ning this distributed query:\\n  1. Transfer both the EMPLOYEE  and the DEPARTMENT  relations to the result \\nsite, and perform the join at site 3. In this case, a total of 1,000,000 + 3,500 = \\n1,003,500 bytes must be transferred.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 891}, page_content='23.5 Query Processing and Optimization in Distributed Databases  861\\n  2. Transfer the EMPLOYEE  relation to site 2, execute the join at site 2, and send \\nthe result to site 3. The size of the query result is 40 * 10,000 = 400,000 bytes, \\nso 400,000 + 1,000,000 = 1,400,000 bytes must be transferred.\\n  3. Transfer the DEPARTMENT  relation to site 1, execute the join at site 1, and \\nsend the result to site 3. In this case, 400,000 + 3,500 = 403,500 bytes must be \\ntransferred.\\nIf minimizing the amount of data transfer is our optimization criterion, we should \\nchoose strategy 3. Now consider another query Q′: For each department, retrieve the \\ndepartment name and the name of the department manager.  This can be stated as \\nfollows in the relational algebra:\\nQ′: πFname,Lname,Dname (DEPARTMENT   Mgr_ssn =Ssn EMPLOYEE )\\nAgain, suppose that the query is submitted at site 3. The same three strategies for \\nexecuting query Q apply to Q′, except that the result of Q′ includes only 100 records, \\nassuming that each department has a manager:\\n  1. Transfer both the EMPLOYEE  and the DEPARTMENT  relations to the result \\nsite, and perform the join at site 3. In this case, a total of 1,000,000 + 3,500 = \\n1,003,500 bytes must be transferred.\\n  2. Transfer the EMPLOYEE  relation to site 2, execute the join at site 2, and send \\nthe result to site 3. The size of the query result is 40 * 100 = 4,000 bytes, so \\n4,000 + 1,000,000 = 1,004,000 bytes must be transferred.\\n  3. Transfer the DEPARTMENT  relation to site 1, execute the join at site 1, and \\nsend the result to site 3. In this case, 4,000 + 3,500 = 7,500 bytes must be \\ntransferred.\\nAgain, we would choose strategy 3—this time by an overwhelming margin over \\nstrategies 1 and 2. The preceding three strategies are the most obvious ones for the FnameEMPLOYEESite 1:\\n10,000 records\\neach record is 100 bytes long \\nSsn field is 9 bytes long \\nDno field is 4 bytes long\\nSite 2:Minit Lname Ssn Salary Super_ssn Dno Bdate Address Sex\\nDnameDEPARTMENT\\nDnumber Mgr_ssn Mgr_start_dateFname field is 15 bytes long\\nLname field is 15 bytes long\\n100 records\\neach record is 35 bytes long \\nDnumber field is 4 bytes long Mgr_ssn field is 9 bytes longDname field is 10 bytes longFigure 23.4 \\nExample to illustrate volume of data  transferred.'),\n",

However, suppose that the result site is site 2; then we have two simple strategies:\\n  1. Transfer the EMPLOYEE  relation to site 2, execute the query, and present the \\nresult to the user at site 2. Here, the same number of bytes—1,000,000—must be transferred for both \\nQ and Q′.\\n  2. Transfer the DEPARTMENT  relation to site 1, execute the query at site 1, and \\nsend the result back to site 2. In this case 400,000 + 3,500 = 403,500 bytes \\nmust be transferred for Q and 4,000 + 3,500 = 7,500 bytes for Q′.\\nA more complex strategy, which sometimes works better than these simple strate-\\ngies, uses an operation called semijoin . We introduce this operation and discuss \\ndistributed execution using semijoins next.\\n23.5.3 Distributed Query Processing Using Semijoin\\nThe idea behind distributed query processing using the semijoin operation  is to \\nreduce the number of tuples in a relation before transferring it to another site. \\nIntuitively, the idea is to send the joining column  of one relation R to the site where \\nthe other relation S is located; this column is then joined with S. Following that, \\nthe join attributes, along with the attributes required in the result, are projected out and shipped back to the original site and joined with R. Hence, only the join-\\ning column of R is transferred in one direction, and a subset of S with no extrane-\\nous tuples or attributes is transferred in the other direction. If only a small fraction \\nof the tuples in S participate in the join, this can be an efficient solution to mini-\\nmizing data transfer.\\nTo illustrate this, consider the following strategy for executing \\nQ or Q′:\\n  1. Project the join attributes of DEPARTMENT  at site 2, and transfer them to site 1. \\nFor Q, we transfer F = πDnumber (DEPARTMENT ), whose size is 4 * 100 = 400 \\nbytes, whereas for Q′, we transfer F′ = πMgr_ssn (DEPARTMENT ), whose size is \\n9 * 100 = 900 bytes.\\n  2. Join the transferred file with the EMPLOYEE  relation at site 1, and transfer \\nthe required attributes from the resulting file to site 2. For Q, we transfer \\nR = πDno, Fname, Lname (F  Dnumber=Dno  EMPLOYEE ), whose size is 34 * 10,000 = \\n340,000 bytes, whereas for Q′, we transfer R′ = πMgr_ssn, Fname, Lname  \\n(F′  Mgr_ssn=Ssn  EMPLOYEE ), whose size is 39 * 100 = 3,900 bytes.\\n  3. Execute the query by joining the transferred file R or R′ with DEPARTMENT , \\nand present the result to the user at site 2.\\nUsing this strategy, we transfer 340,400 bytes for Q and 4,800 bytes for Q′. We lim-\\nited the EMPLOYEE  attributes and tuples transmitted to site 2 in step 2 to only those \\nthat will actually be joined  with a DEPARTMENT  tuple in step 3. For query Q, this \\nturned out to include all EMPLOYEE  tuples, so little improvement was achieved. \\nHowever, for Q′ only 100 out of the 10,000 EMPLOYEE  tuples were needed.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 893}, page_content='23.5 Query Processing and Optimization in Distributed Databases  863\\nThe semijoin operation was devised to formalize this strategy. A semijoin operation  \\nR A=B S, where A and B are domain-compatible attributes of R and S, respectively, \\nproduces the same result as the relational algebra expression πR(R A=B S). In a dis-\\ntributed environment where R and S reside at different sites, the semijoin is typically \\nimplemented by first transferring F = πB(S) to the site where R resides and then join-\\ning F with R, thus leading to the strategy discussed here.\\nNotice that the semijoin operation is not commutative; that is,\\nR  S ≠S  R\\n23.5.4 Query and Update Decomposition\\nIn a DDBMS with no distribution transparency,  the user phrases a query directly in \\nterms of specific fragments. For example, consider another query Q: Retrieve the \\nnames and hours per week for each employee who works on some project controlled by department 5 , which is specified on the distributed database where the relations \\nat sites 2 and 3 are shown in Figure 23.2, and those at site 1 are shown in Fig-ure\\xa05.6, as in our earlier example. A user who submits such a query must specify whether it references the \\nPROJS_5  and WORKS_ON_5  relations at site 2 (Fig-\\nure\\xa023.2) or the PROJECT  and WORKS_ON  relations at site 1 (Figure 5.6). The user \\nmust also maintain consistency of replicated data items when updating a DDBMS \\nwith no replication transparency.\\nOn the other hand, a DDBMS that supports full distribution, fragmentation,  and \\nreplication transparency  allows the user to specify a query or update request on \\nthe schema in Figure 5.5 just as though the DBMS were centralized. For updates, \\nthe DDBMS is responsible for maintaining consistency among replicated items  \\nby\\xa0using one of the distributed concurrency control algorithms discussed in  Section\\xa023.3. For queries, a query decomposition  module must break up or \\n decompose  a query into subqueries  that can be executed at the individual sites. \\nAdditionally, a strategy for combining the results of the subqueries to form the query result must be generated. Whenever the DDBMS determines that an item referenced in the query is replicated, it must choose or materialize  a particular \\nreplica during query execution.\\nTo determine which replicas include the data items referenced in a query, the \\nDDBMS refers to the fragmentation, replication, and distribution information \\nstored in the DDBMS catalog. For vertical fragmentation, the attribute list for each fragment is kept in the catalog. For horizontal fragmentation, a condition, sometimes called a guard , is kept for each fragment. This is basically a selection \\ncondition that specifies which tuples exist in the fragment; it is called a guard because only tuples that satisfy this condition  are permitted to be stored in the \\nfragment. For mixed fragments, both the attribute list and the guard condition are kept in the catalog.\\nIn our earlier example, the guard conditions for fragments at site 1 (Figure 5.6) are \\nTRUE (all tuples), and the attribute lists are * (all attributes). For the fragments'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 894}, page_content='864 Chapter 23 Distributed Database Concepts\\nshown in Figure 23.2, we have the guard conditions and attribute lists shown in \\nFigure 23.5. When the DDBMS decomposes an update request, it can determine which fragments must be updated by examining their guard conditions. For exam-ple, a user request to insert a new \\nEMPLOYEE  tuple <‘Alex’, ‘B’, ‘Coleman’, \\n‘345671239’, ‘22-APR-64’, ‘3306 Sandstone, Houston, TX’, M, 33000, ‘987654321’, \\n4> would be decomposed by the DDBMS into two insert requests: the first inserts \\nthe preceding tuple in the EMPLOYEE  fragment at site 1, and the second inserts the \\nprojected tuple <‘Alex’, ‘B’, ‘Coleman’, ‘345671239’, 33000, ‘987654321’, 4> in the \\nEMPD4  fragment at site 3.\\nFor query decomposition, the DDBMS can determine which fragments may contain \\nthe required tuples by comparing the query condition with the guard conditions.

This can be speci-\\nfied in SQL on the schema in Figure 5.5 as follows:\\nQ: SELECT  Fname, Lname, Hours\\n FROM  EMPLOYEE, PROJECT, WORKS_ON\\n WHERE  Dnum =5 AND  Pnumber =Pno AND  Essn =Ssn;\\nSuppose that the query is submitted at site 2, which is where the query result will be \\nneeded. The DDBMS can determine from the guard condition on PROJS5  and \\nWORKS_ON5  that all tuples satisfying the conditions ( Dnum  = 5 AND  Pnumber  = Pno) \\nreside at site 2. Hence, it may decompose the query into the following relational alge-bra subqueries:\\nT\\n1 ← πEssn(PROJS5  Pnumber=Pno WORKS_ON5)\\nT2 ← πEssn, Fname, Lname (T1 Essn =SsnEMPLOYEE)\\nRESULT ← πFname, Lname, Hours (T2* WORKS_ON5)\\nThis decomposition can be used to execute the query by using a semijoin strategy. \\nThe DDBMS knows from the guard conditions that PROJS5  contains exactly those \\ntuples satisfying ( Dnum  = 5) and that WORKS_ON5  contains all tuples to be joined \\nwith PROJS5 ; hence, subquery T1 can be executed at site 2, and the projected column \\nEssn  can be sent to site 1. Subquery T2 can then be executed at site 1, and the result \\ncan be sent back to site 2, where the final query result is calculated and displayed to \\nthe user. An alternative strategy would be to send the query Q itself to site 1, which \\nincludes all the database tuples, where it would be executed locally and from which \\nthe result would be sent back to site 2. The query optimizer would estimate the costs \\nof both strategies and would choose the one with the lower cost estimate.\\n23.6 Types of Distributed Database Systems\\nThe term distributed database management system  can describe various systems \\nthat differ from one another in many respects. The main thing that all such systems have in common is the fact that data and software are distributed over multiple sites connected by some form of communication network. In this section, we discuss a number of types of DDBMSs and the criteria and factors that make some of these systems different.\\nThe first factor we consider is the degree of homogeneity  of the DDBMS software. If \\nall servers (or individual local DBMSs) use identical software and all users (clients) use identical software, the DDBMS is called homogeneous ; otherwise, it is called hetero-\\ngeneous . Another factor related to the degree of homogeneity is the degree of local \\nautonomy . If there is no provision for the local site to function as a standalone DBMS, \\nthen the system has no local autonomy . On the other hand, if direct access  by local \\ntransactions to a server is permitted, the system has some degree of local autonomy.\\nFigure 23.6 shows classification of DDBMS alternatives along orthogonal axes of \\ndistribution, autonomy, and heterogeneity. For a centralized database, there is'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 896}, page_content='866 Chapter 23 Distributed Database Concepts\\ncomplete autonomy but a total lack of distribution and heterogeneity (point A in \\nthe figure). We see that the degree of local autonomy provides further ground for classification into federated and multidatabase systems. At one extreme of the autonomy spectrum, we have a DDBMS that looks like  a centralized DBMS to the \\nuser, with zero autonomy (point B). A single conceptual schema exists, and all access to the system is obtained through a site that is part of the DDBMS—which means that no local autonomy exists. Along the autonomy axis we encounter two types of DDBMSs called federated database system  (point C) and multidatabase \\nsystem  (point D) . In such systems, each server is an independent and autonomous \\ncentralized DBMS that has its own local users, local transactions, and DBA, and hence has a very high degree of local autonomy.  The term federated database \\n system (FDBS)  is used when there is some global view or schema of the federation \\nof databases that is shared by the applications (point C). On the other hand, a  multidatabase system  has full local autonomy in that it does not have a global \\nschema but interactively constructs one as needed by the application (point D). Both systems are hybrids between distributed and centralized systems, and the distinction we made between them is not strictly followed. We will refer to them as FDBSs in a generic sense. Point D in the diagram may also stand for a system with full local autonomy and full heterogeneity—this could be a peer-to-peer database system. In a heterogeneous FDBS, one server may be a relational DBMS, another a network DBMS (such as Computer Associates’ IDMS or HP’S IMAGE/3000), and BDistribution\\nHeterogeneityLegend:\\nA: Traditional centralized database \\n systems\\nB: Pure distributed dat abase systems\\nC:  Federated database systems\\nD: Multidatabase or peer-to-peer \\n database systemsC DAAutonomy\\nFigure 23.6 \\nClassification  of distributed databases.'),\n",

We \\ndiscuss these sources first and then point out how the different types of autonomies contribute to a semantic heterogeneity that must be resolved in a heterogeneous FDBS.\\n ■Differences in data models.  Databases in an organization come from a vari-\\nety of data models, including the so-called legacy models (hierarchical and network), the relational data model, the object data model, and even files. The modeling capabilities of the models vary. Hence, to deal with them uni-formly via a single global schema or to process them in a single language is challenging. Even if two databases are both from the RDBMS environment, the same information may be represented as an attribute name, as a relation name, or as a value in different databases. This calls for an intelligent query-processing mechanism that can relate information based on metadata.\\n ■Differences in constraints.  Constraint facilities for specification and imple-\\nmentation vary from system to system. There are comparable features that \\nmust be reconciled in the construction of a global schema. For example, the \\nrelationships from ER models are represented as referential integrity con-\\nstraints in the relational model. Triggers may have to be used to implement certain constraints in the relational model. The global schema must also deal with potential conflicts among constraints.\\n ■Differences in query languages.  Even with the same data model, the lan-\\nguages and their versions vary. For example, SQL has multiple versions like \\nSQL-89, SQL-92, SQL-99, and SQL:2008, and each system has its own set of \\ndata types, comparison operators, string manipulation features, and so on.\\nSemantic Heterogeneity. Semantic heterogeneity occurs when there are differ-\\nences in the meaning, interpretation, and intended use of the same or related data. Semantic heterogeneity among component database systems (DBSs) creates the biggest hurdle in designing global schemas of heterogeneous databases. The design \\nautonomy  of component DBSs refers to their freedom of choosing the following \\ndesign parameters; the design parameters in turn affect the eventual complexity of the FDBS:\\n ■The universe of discourse from which the data is drawn.  For example, for \\ntwo customer accounts, databases in the federation may be from the United \\nStates and Japan and have entirely different sets of attributes about customer \\naccounts required by the accounting practices. Currency rate fluctuations'),\n",

Hence, relations in these two databases that \\nhave identical names— CUSTOMER  or ACCOUNT —may have some common \\nand some entirely distinct information.\\n ■Representation and naming.  The representation and naming of data ele-\\nments and the structure of the data model may be prespecified for each local database.\\n ■The understanding, meaning, and subjective interpretation of data.  This \\nis a chief contributor to semantic heterogeneity.\\n ■Transaction and policy constraints.  These deal with serializability criteria, \\ncompensating transactions, and other transaction policies.\\n ■Derivation of summaries.  Aggregation, summarization, and other data-\\nprocessing features and operations supported by the system.\\nThe above problems related to semantic heterogeneity are being faced by all major \\nmultinational and governmental organizations in all application areas. In today’s commercial environment, most enterprises are resorting to heterogeneous FDBSs, having heavily invested in the development of individual database systems using \\ndiverse data models on different platforms over the last 20 to 30 years. Enterprises \\nare using various forms of software—typically called the middleware ; or Web-\\nbased packages called application servers  (for example, WebLogic or WebSphere); \\nand even generic systems, called enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems  (for \\nexample, SAP, J. D. Edwards ERP)—to manage the transport of queries and trans-actions from the global application to individual databases (with possible additional processing for business rules) and the data from the heterogeneous database servers to the global application. Detailed discussion of these types of software systems is outside the scope of this text.\\nJust as providing the ultimate transparency is the goal of any distributed database \\narchitecture, local component databases strive to preserve autonomy.  Communication autonomy  of a component DBS refers to its ability to decide \\nwhether to communicate with another component DBS. Execution autonomy  \\nrefers to the ability of a component DBS to execute local operations without inter-ference from external operations by other component DBSs and its ability to decide the order in which to execute them. The association autonomy  of a component \\nDBS implies that it has the ability to decide whether and how much to share its functionality (operations it supports) and resources (data it manages) with other component DBSs. The major challenge of designing FDBSs is to let component DBSs interoperate while still providing the above types of autonomies to them.\\n23.7 Distributed Database Architectures\\nIn this section, we first briefly point out the distinction between parallel and distrib-uted database architectures. Although both are prevalent in industry today, there are various manifestations of the distributed architectures that are continuously evolv-ing among large enterprises. The parallel architecture is more common in high-per-'),\n",

We then introduce a generic architecture of a distributed database. This is followed by discussions on the architecture of three-tier client/server and federated database systems.\\n23.7.1 Parallel versus Distributed Architectures\\nThere are two main types of multiprocessor system architectures that are com-monplace:\\n ■Shared memory (tightly coupled) architecture.  Multiple processors share \\nsecondary (disk) storage and also share primary memory.\\n ■Shared disk (loosely coupled) architecture.  Multiple processors share sec-\\nondary (disk) storage but each has their own primary memory.\\nThese architectures enable processors to communicate without the overhead of \\nexchanging messages over a network.4 Database management systems developed \\nusing the above types of architectures are termed parallel database management \\nsystems  rather than DDBMSs, since they utilize parallel processor technology. \\nAnother type of multiprocessor architecture is called shared-nothing architecture . \\nIn this architecture, every processor has its own primary and secondary (disk) memory, no common memory exists, and the processors communicate over a high-speed interconnection network (bus or switch). Although the shared-nothing architecture resembles a distributed database computing environment, major dif-ferences exist in the mode of operation. In shared-nothing multiprocessor systems, there is symmetry and homogeneity of nodes; this is not true of the distributed database environment, where heterogeneity of hardware and operating system at each node is very common. Shared-nothing architecture is also considered as an environment for parallel databases. Figure 23.7(a) illustrates a parallel database (shared nothing), whereas Figure 23.7(b) illustrates a centralized database with dis-tributed access and Figure 23.7(c) shows a pure distributed database. We will not expand on parallel architectures and related data management issues here.\\n23.7.2 General Architecture of Pure Distributed Databases\\nIn this section, we discuss both the logical and component architectural models of a \\nDDB. In Figure 23.8, which describes the generic schema architecture of a DDB, the \\nenterprise is presented with a consistent, unified view showing the logical structure \\nof underlying data across all nodes. This view is represented by the global concep-\\ntual schema (GCS), which provides network transparency (see Section 23.1.2). To \\naccommodate potential heterogeneity in the DDB, each node is shown as having its own local internal schema (LIS) based on physical organization details at that \\n4If both primary and secondary memories are shared, the architecture is also known as shared- every-\\nthing architecture .'),\n",

The global query compiler references the global \\n conceptual schema from the global system catalog to verify and impose defined constraints. The global query optimizer references both global and local conceptual schemas and generates optimized local queries from global queries. It evaluates all candidate strategies using a cost function that estimates cost based on response time (CPU, I/O, and network latencies) and estimated sizes of intermediate results. The latter is particularly important in queries involving joins. Having computed the cost for each candidate, the optimizer selects the candidate with the minimum cost for execution. Each local DBMS would have its local query optimizer, transaction manager, and execution engines as well as the local system catalog, which houses the local schemas. The global transaction manager is responsible for coordinating the execution across multiple sites in conjunction with the local transaction manager at those sites.\\n23.7.3 Federated Database Schema Architecture\\nTypical five-level schema architecture to support global applications in the FDBS environment is shown in Figure 23.9.

It is now more common to use a three-tier architecture rather than a \\ntwo-tier architecture, particularly in Web applications. This architecture is illus-trated in Figure 23.10.\\nIn the three-tier client/server architecture, the following three layers exist:\\n  1. Presentation layer (client).  This provides the user interface and interacts \\nwith the user. The programs at this layer present Web interfaces or forms to the client in order to interface with the application. Web browsers are often utilized, and the languages and specifications used include HTML, XHTML, CSS, Flash, MathML, Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), Java, JavaScript, Adobe Flex, and others. This layer handles user input, output, and naviga-tion by accepting user commands and displaying the needed information, usually in the form of static or dynamic Web pages. The latter are employed \\nwhen the interaction involves database access. When a Web interface is \\nused, this layer typically communicates with the application layer via the HTTP protocol.\\n  2. Application layer (business logic).  This layer programs the application \\nlogic. For example, queries can be formulated based on user input from the client, or query results can be formatted and sent to the client for presenta-tion. Additional application functionality can be handled at this layer, such as security checks, identity verification, and other functions. The application layer can interact with one or more databases or data sources as needed by \\nconnecting to the database using ODBC, JDBC, SQL/CLI, or other database \\naccess techniques.Client\\nUser interface or presentation tier\\n(Web browser, HTML, JavaScript, Visual Basic, . . .)\\nHTTP Protocol\\nApplication server\\nApplication (business) logic tier\\n(Application program, JAVA, C/C++, C#, . . .)\\nDatabase server\\nQuery and transaction processing tier\\n(Database access, SQL, PSM, XML, . . .)ODBC, JDBC, SQL/CLI, SQLJ\\nFigure 23.10 \\nThe three-tier client/server architecture.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 904}, page_content='874 Chapter 23 Distributed Database Concepts\\n  3. Database server.  This layer handles query and update requests from the \\napplication layer, processes the requests, and sends the results. Usually SQL is used to access the database if it is relational or object-relational, and stored database procedures may also be invoked. Query results (and queries) may be formatted into XML (see Chapter 13) when transmitted between the application server and the database server.\\nExactly how to divide the DBMS functionality among the client, application server, \\nand database server may vary. The common approach is to include the functional-ity of a centralized DBMS at the database server level. A number of relational DBMS products have taken this approach, in which an SQL server  is provided. The appli-\\ncation server must then formulate the appropriate SQL queries and connect to the database server when needed. The client provides the processing for user interface interactions. Since SQL is a relational standard, various SQL servers, possibly pro-vided by different vendors, can accept SQL commands through standards such as ODBC, JDBC, and SQL/CLI (see Chapter 10).\\nIn this architecture, the application server may also refer to a data dictionary \\nthat includes information on the distribution of data among the various SQL servers, as well as modules for decomposing a global query into a number of local queries that can be executed at the various sites. Interaction between an application server and database server might proceed as follows during the pro-cessing of an SQL query:\\n  1. The application server formulates a user query based on input from the cli-ent layer and decomposes it into a number of independent site queries. Each \\nsite query is sent to the appropriate database server site.\\n  2. Each database server processes the local query and sends the results to the \\napplication server site. Increasingly, XML is being touted as the standard for \\ndata exchange (see Chapter 13), so the database server may format the query \\nresult into XML before sending it to the application server.\\n  3. The application server combines the results of the subqueries to produce the result of the originally required query, formats it into HTML or some other \\nform accepted by the client, and sends it to the client site for display.\\nThe application server is responsible for generating a distributed execution plan for \\na multisite query or transaction and for supervising distributed execution by send-\\ning commands to servers. These commands include local queries and transactions to be executed, as well as commands to transmit data to other clients or servers. Another function controlled by the application server (or coordinator) is that of ensuring consistency of replicated copies of a data item by employing distributed (or global) concurrency control techniques. The application server must also ensure the atomicity of global transactions by performing global recovery when certain sites fail.\\nIf the DDBMS has the capability to hide  the details of data distribution from the \\napplication server, then it enables the application server to execute global queries and transactions as though the database were centralized, without having to specify'),\n",

This \\n property is called distribution transparency . Some DDBMSs do not provide distri-\\nbution transparency, instead requiring that applications are aware of the details of data distribution.\\n23.8 Distributed Catalog Management\\nEfficient catalog management in distributed databases is critical to ensure satisfac-\\ntory performance related to site autonomy, view management, and data distribu-tion and replication. Catalogs are databases themselves containing metadata about the distributed database system.\\nThree popular management schemes for distributed catalogs are centralized  cata-\\nlogs, fully replicated  catalogs, and partitioned  catalogs. The choice of the scheme \\ndepends on the database itself as well as the access patterns of the applications to the underlying data.\\nCentralized Catalogs.  In this scheme, the entire catalog is stored in one single \\nsite. Due to its central nature, it is easy to implement. On the other hand, the \\nadvantages of reliability, availability, autonomy, and distribution of processing \\nload are adversely impacted. For read operations from noncentral sites, the \\nrequested catalog data is locked at the central site and is then sent to the \\nrequesting site. On completion of the read operation, an acknowledgment is sent to the central site, which in turn unlocks this data. All update operations must be processed through the central site. This can quickly become a perfor-mance bottleneck for write-intensive applications.\\nFully Replicated Catalogs.  In this scheme, identical copies of the complete \\ncatalog are present at each site. This scheme facilitates faster reads by allowing them to be answered locally. However, all updates must be broadcast to all sites. Updates are treated as transactions, and a centralized two-phase commit scheme is employed to ensure catalog consistency. As with the centralized scheme, write-intensive applications may cause increased network traffic due to the broadcast associated with the writes.\\nPartially Replicated Catalogs.  The centralized and fully replicated schemes \\nrestrict site autonomy since they must ensure a consistent global view of the \\ncatalog. Under the partially replicated scheme, each site maintains complete catalog information on data stored locally at that site. Each site is also permit-ted to cache entries retrieved from remote sites. However, there are no guaran-tees that these cached copies will be the most recent and updated. The system tracks catalog entries for sites where the object was created and for sites that contain copies of this object. Any changes to copies are propagated immedi-ately to the original (birth) site. Retrieving updated copies to replace stale data \\nmay be delayed until an access to this data occurs. In general, fragments of rela-\\ntions across sites should be uniquely accessible. Also, to ensure data distribu-tion transparency, users should be allowed to create synonyms for remote objects and use these synonyms for subsequent referrals.'),\n",

This is a very \\nbroad topic, and we discussed only some of the basic techniques used with distrib-uted databases. First in Section 23.1 we discussed the reasons for distribution and DDB concepts in Section 23.1.1. Then we defined the concept of distribution trans-parency and the related concepts of fragmentation transparency and replication transparency in Section 23.1.2. We discussed the concepts of distributed availability and reliability in Section 23.1.3, and gave an overview of scalability and partition tolerance issues in Section 23.1.4. We discussed autonomy of nodes in a distributed system in Section 23.1.5 and the potential advantages of distributed databases over centralized system in Section 23.1.6.\\nIn Section 23.2, we discussed the design issues related to data fragmentation, \\nreplication, and distribution. We distinguished between horizontal fragmenta-tion (sharding) and vertical fragmentation of relations in Section 23.2.1. We then discussed in Section 23.2.2 the use of data replication to improve system reliability and availability. In Section 23.3, we briefly discussed the concur-rency control and recovery techniques used in DDBMSs, and then reviewed some of the additional problems that must be dealt with in a distributed envi-ronment that do not appear in a centralized environment. Then in Section 23.4 we discussed transaction management, including different commit protocols (2-phase commit, 3-phase commit) and operating system support for transac-\\ntion management.\\nWe then illustrated some of the techniques used in distributed query processing in \\nSection 23.5, and discussed the cost of communication among sites, which is con-\\nsidered a major factor in distributed query optimization. We compared the differ-\\nent techniques for executing joins, and we then presented the semijoin technique for joining relations that reside on different sites in Section 23.5.3.\\nFollowing that, in Section 23.6, we categorized DDBMSs by using criteria such as \\nthe degree of homogeneity of software modules and the degree of local autonomy. In Section 23.7 we distinguished between parallel and distributed system architec-tures and then introduced the generic architecture of distributed databases from both a component as well as a schematic architectural perspective. In Section 23.7.3 we discussed in some detail issues of federated database management, and we focused on the needs of supporting various types of autonomies and dealing with semantic heterogeneity. We also reviewed the client/server architecture concepts \\nand related them to distributed databases in Section 23.7.4. We reviewed catalog \\nmanagement in distributed databases and summarized their relative advantages \\nand disadvantages in Section 23.8.\\nChapters 24 and 25 will describe recent advances in distributed databases and dis-\\ntributed computing related to big data. Chapter 24 describes the so-called NOSQL \\nsystems, which are highly scalable, distributed database systems that handle large \\nvolumes of data. Chapter 25 discusses cloud computing and distributed computing \\ntechnologies that are needed to process big data.'),\n",

Some system issues concerning client/server DBMS architectures are discussed in Carey et al. (1991), DeWitt et al. (1990), and Wang and Rowe (1991). Khoshafian et al. (1992) discuss design issues for relational DBMSs in the \\nclient/server environment. Client/server management issues are discussed in many \\nbooks, such as Zantinge and Adriaans (1996).

The term NOSQL  is \\ngenerally interpreted as Not Only SQL—rather than NO to SQL—and is meant to convey that many applications need systems other than traditional relational SQL systems to augment their data management needs. Most NOSQL systems are distributed databases or distributed storage systems, with a focus on semis-tructured data storage, high performance, availability, data replication, and scal-\\nability as opposed to an emphasis on immediate data consistency, powerful \\nquery languages, and structured data storage.\\nWe start in Section 24.1 with an introduction to NOSQL systems, their character-\\nistics, and how they differ from SQL systems. We also describe four general cate-gories of NOSQL systems—document-based, key-value stores, column-based, and graph-based. Section 24.2 discusses how NOSQL systems approach the issue of consistency among multiple replicas (copies) by using the paradigm known as eventual consistency . We discuss the CAP  theorem, which can be used to under-\\nstand the emphasis of NOSQL systems on availability. In Sections 24.3 through  24.6, we present an overview of each category of NOSQL systems—starting with document-based systems, followed by key-value stores, then column-based, and finally graph-based. Some systems may not fall neatly into a single category, but rather use techniques that span two or more categories of NOSQL systems. \\nFinally, Section 24.7 is the chapter summary.chapter 24'),\n",

Consider a free e-mail application, such as Google Mail or Yahoo \\nMail or other similar service—this application can have millions of users, and each \\nuser can have thousands of e-mail messages. There is a need for a storage system \\nthat can manage all these e-mails; a structured relational SQL system may not be \\nappropriate because (1) SQL systems offer too many services (powerful query lan-guage, concurrency control, etc.), which this application may not need; and (2) a structured data model such the traditional relational model may be too restrictive. Although newer relational systems do have more complex object-relational model-ing options (see Chapter 12), they still require schemas, which are not required by many of the NOSQL systems.\\nAs another example, consider an application such as Facebook, with millions of \\nusers who submit posts, many with images and videos; then these posts must be displayed on pages of other users using the social media relationships among the users. User profiles, user relationships, and posts must all be stored in a huge collec-tion of data stores, and the appropriate posts must be made available to the sets of users that have signed up to see these posts. Some of the data for this type of appli-cation is not suitable for a traditional relational system and typically needs multiple types of databases and data storage systems.\\nSome of the organizations that were faced with these data management and storage \\napplications decided to develop their own systems:\\n ■Google developed a proprietary NOSQL system known as BigTable , which is \\nused in many of Google’s applications that require vast amounts of data stor-age, such as Gmail, Google Maps, and Web site indexing. Apache Hbase is an open source NOSQL system based on similar concepts. Google’s innovation led to the category of NOSQL systems known as column-based  or wide \\ncolumn  stores; they are also sometimes referred to as column family  stores.\\n ■Amazon developed a NOSQL system called DynamoDB  that is available \\nthrough Amazon’s cloud services. This innovation led to the category known as key-value  data stores or sometimes key-tuple  or key-object  data stores.\\n ■Facebook developed a NOSQL system called Cassandra , which is now open \\nsource and known as Apache Cassandra. This NOSQL system uses concepts from both key-value stores and column-based systems.\\n ■Other software companies started developing their own solutions and making \\nthem available to users who need these capabilities—for example, MongoDB  \\nand CouchDB , which are classified as document-based  NOSQL systems or \\ndocument stores .\\n ■Another category of NOSQL systems is the graph-based  NOSQL systems, \\nor graph databases ; these include Neo4J  and GraphBase , among others.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 915}, page_content='24.1 Introduction to NOSQL Systems  885\\n ■Some NOSQL systems, such as OrientDB , combine concepts from many of \\nthe categories discussed above.\\n ■In addition to the newer types of NOSQL systems listed above, it is also pos-\\nsible to classify database systems based on the object model (see Chapter 12) or on the native XML model (see Chapter 13) as NOSQL systems, although they may not have the high-performance and replication characteristics of the other types of NOSQL systems.\\nThese are just a few examples of NOSQL systems that have been developed. There \\nare many systems, and listing all of them is beyond the scope of our presentation.\\n24.1.2 Characteristics of NOSQL Systems\\nWe now discuss the characteristics of many NOSQL systems, and how these sys-tems differ from traditional SQL systems. We divide the characteristics into two categories—those related to distributed databases and distributed systems, and those related to data models and query languages.\\nNOSQL characteristics related to distributed databases and distributed \\nsystems. NOSQL systems emphasize high availability, so replicating the data is \\ninherent in many of these systems. Scalability is another important characteristic, because many of the applications that use NOSQL systems tend to have data that keeps growing in volume. High performance is another required characteristic, whereas serializable consistency may not be as important for some of the NOSQL applications. We discuss some of these characteristics next.\\n  1. Scalability:  As we discussed in Section 23.1.4, there are two kinds of scal-\\nability in distributed systems: horizontal and vertical. In NOSQL systems, horizontal scalability  is generally used, where the distributed system is \\nexpanded by adding more nodes for data storage and processing as the vol-ume of data grows. Vertical scalability, on the other hand, refers to expand-ing the storage and computing power of existing nodes. In NOSQL systems, horizontal scalability is employed while the system is operational, so tech-niques for distributing the existing data among new nodes without inter-\\nrupting system operation are necessary. We will discuss some of these \\ntechniques in Sections 24.3 through  24.6 when we discuss specific systems.\\n  2. Availability, Replication and Eventual Consistency:  Many applications \\nthat use NOSQL systems require continuous system availability. To accom-plish this, data is replicated over two or more nodes in a transparent man-ner, so that if one node fails, the data is still available on other nodes. Replication improves data availability and can also improve read perfor-mance, because read requests can often be serviced from any of the repli-cated data nodes. However, write performance becomes more cumbersome because an update must be applied to every copy of the replicated data items; this can slow down write performance if serializable consistency is required (see Section 23.3). Many NOSQL applications do not require serializable'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 916}, page_content='886 Chapter 24 NOSQL Databases and Big Data Storage Systems\\nconsistency, so more relaxed forms of consistency known as eventual \\nconsistency  are used. We discuss this in more detail in Section 24.2.\\n  3. Replication Models:  Two major replication models are used in NOSQL sys-\\ntems: master-slave and master-master replication. Master-slave replication  \\nrequires one copy to be the master copy; all write operations must be applied to the master copy and then propagated to the slave copies, usually using eventual consistency (the slave copies will eventually  be the same as the mas-\\nter copy). For read, the master-slave paradigm can be configured in various ways. One configuration requires all reads to also be at the master copy, so this would be similar to the primary site or primary copy methods of distrib-uted concurrency control (see Section 23.3.1), with similar advantages and disadvantages. Another configuration would allow reads at the slave copies but would not guarantee that the values are the latest writes, since writes to the slave nodes can be done after they are applied to the master copy. The master-master replication  allows reads and writes at any of the replicas but \\nmay not guarantee that reads at nodes that store different copies see the same values. Different users may write the same data item concurrently at different nodes of the system, so the values of the item will be temporarily inconsistent. A reconciliation method to resolve conflicting write operations of the same data item at different nodes must be implemented as part of the master-master replication scheme.\\n  4. Sharding of Files:  In many NOSQL applications, files (or collections of data \\nobjects) can have many millions of records (or documents or objects), and these records can be accessed concurrently by thousands of users. So it is not practical to store the whole file in one node. Sharding  (also known as \\n horizontal partitioning  ; see Section 23.2) of the file records is often \\nemployed in NOSQL systems. This serves to distribute the load of accessing the file records to multiple nodes. The combination of sharding the file records and replicating the shards works in tandem to improve load  balancing as well as data availability. We will discuss some of the sharding techniques in Sections 24.3 through  24.6 when we discuss specific systems.\\n  5. High-Performance Data Access:  In many NOSQL applications, it is neces-\\nsary to find individual records or objects (data items) from among the mil-lions of data records or objects in a file. To achieve this, most systems use one of two techniques: hashing or range partitioning on object keys. The majority of accesses to an object will be by providing the key value rather than by using complex query conditions. The object key is similar to the concept of object id (see Section 12.1). In hashing , a hash function h(K)  is \\napplied to the key K, and the location of the object with key K is determined \\nby the value of h(K) . In range partitioning , the location is determined via a \\nrange of key values; for example, location i would hold the objects whose key \\nvalues K are in the range Ki\\nmin ≤ K ≤ Ki max. In applications that require \\nrange queries, where multiple objects within a range of key values are \\nretrieved, range partitioned is preferred. Other indexes can also be used to \\nlocate objects based on attribute conditions different from the key K. We'),\n",

We discuss some of these characteristics next.\\n  1. Not Requiring a Schema:  The flexibility of not requiring a schema is \\nachieved in many NOSQL systems by allowing semi-structured, self-describing data (see Section 13.1). The users can specify a partial schema in some systems to improve storage efficiency, but it is not required to have a \\nschema  in most of the NOSQL systems. As there may not be a schema to \\nspecify constraints, any constraints on the data would have to be pro-grammed in the application programs that access the data items. There are various languages for describing semistructured data, such as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and XML (Extensible Markup Language; see Chapter 13). JSON is used in several NOSQL systems, but other methods for describing semi-structured data can also be used. We will discuss JSON in Section 24.3 when we present document-based NOSQL systems.\\n  2. Less Powerful Query Languages:  Many applications that use NOSQL sys-\\ntems may not require a powerful query language such as SQL, because \\nsearch (read) queries in these systems often locate single objects in a single \\nfile based on their object keys. NOSQL systems typically provide a set of \\nfunctions and operations as a programming API (application programming interface), so reading and writing the data objects is accomplished by calling the appropriate operations by the programmer. In many cases, the opera-\\ntions are called CRUD operations , for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. In \\nother cases, they are known as SCRUD  because of an added Search (or Find) \\noperation. Some NOSQL systems also provide a high-level query language, but it may not have the full power of SQL; only a subset of SQL querying capabilities would be provided. In particular, many NOSQL systems do not provide join operations as part of the query language itself; the joins need to be implemented in the application programs.\\n  3. Versioning:  Some NOSQL systems provide storage of multiple versions of \\nthe data items, with the timestamps of when the data version was created. \\nWe will discuss this aspect in Section 24.5 when we present column-based \\nNOSQL systems.\\nIn the next section, we give an overview of the various categories of NOSQL \\nsystems.\\n24.1.3 Categories of NOSQL Systems\\nNOSQL systems have been characterized into four major categories, with some additional categories that encompass other types of systems. The most common categorization lists the following four major categories:'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 918}, page_content='888 Chapter 24 NOSQL Databases and Big Data Storage Systems\\n  1. Document-based NOSQL systems:  These systems store data in the form of \\ndocuments using well-known formats, such as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). Documents are accessible via their document id, but can also be accessed rapidly using other indexes.\\n  2. NOSQL key-value stores:  These systems have a simple data model based \\non fast access by the key to the value associated with the key; the value can be a record or an object or a document or even have a more complex data structure.\\n  3. Column-based or wide column NOSQL systems:  These systems partition a \\ntable by column into column families (a form of vertical partitioning; see Section 23.2), where each column family is stored in its own files. They also allow versioning of data values.\\n  4. Graph-based NOSQL systems:  Data is represented as graphs, and related \\nnodes can be found by traversing the edges using path expressions.\\nAdditional categories can be added as follows to include some systems that are not \\neasily categorized into the above four categories, as well as some other types of sys-\\ntems that have been available even before the term NOSQL became widely used.\\n  5. Hybrid NOSQL systems:  These systems have characteristics from two or \\nmore of the above four categories.\\n  6. Object databases:  These systems were discussed in Chapter 12.\\n  7. XML databases:  We discussed XML in Chapter 13.\\nEven keyword-based search engines store large amounts of data with fast search \\naccess, so the stored data can be considered as large NOSQL big data stores.\\nThe rest of this chapter is organized as follows. In each of Sections 24.3 through  \\n24.6, we will discuss one of the four main categories of NOSQL systems, and elabo-rate further on which characteristics each category focuses on. Before that, in Sec-tion 24.2, we discuss in more detail the concept of eventual consistency, and we discuss the associated CAP theorem.\\n24.2 The CAP Theorem\\nWhen we discussed concurrency control in distributed databases in Section 23.3, we assumed that the distributed database system (DDBS) is required to enforce the ACID properties (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) of transactions that \\nare running concurrently (see Section 20.3). In a system with data replication, con-\\ncurrency control becomes more complex because there can be multiple copies of each data item. So if an update is applied to one copy of an item, it must be applied to all other copies in a consistent manner. The possibility exists that one copy of an item X is updated by a transaction T\\n1 whereas another copy is updated by a transac-\\ntion T2, so two inconsistent copies of the same item exist at two different nodes in \\nthe distributed system. If two other transactions T3 and T4 want to read X, each may \\nread a different copy of item X.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 919}, page_content='24.2 The CAP Theorem  889\\nWe saw in Section 23.3 that there are distributed concurrency control methods that \\ndo not allow this inconsistency among copies of the same data item, thus enforcing serializability and hence the isolation property in the presence of replication. How-ever, these techniques often come with high overhead, which would defeat the pur-pose of creating multiple copies to improve performance and availability in distributed database systems such as NOSQL. In the field of distributed systems, there are various levels of consistency among replicated data items, from weak con-sistency to strong consistency. Enforcing serializability is considered the strongest form of consistency, but it has high overhead so it can reduce performance of read and write operations and hence adversely affect system performance.\\nThe CAP theorem, which was originally introduced as the CAP principle, can be \\nused to explain some of the competing requirements in a distributed system with replication. The three letters in CAP refer to three desirable properties of distributed systems with replicated data: consistency  (among replicated copies), availability  (of \\nthe system for read and write operations) and partition tolerance  (in the face of the \\nnodes in the system being partitioned by a network fault). Availability  means that \\neach read or write request for a data item will either be processed successfully or will receive a message that the operation cannot be completed. Partition tolerance  means \\nthat the system can continue operating if the network connecting the nodes has a fault that results in two or more partitions, where the nodes in each partition can only communicate among each other. Consistency  means that the nodes will have \\nthe same copies of a replicated data item visible for various transactions.\\nIt is important to note here that the use of the word consistency  in CAP and its use \\nin ACID do not refer to the same identical concept . In CAP, the term consistency  \\nrefers to the consistency of the values in different copies of the same data item in a replicated distributed system. In ACID, it refers to the fact that a transaction will not violate the integrity constraints specified on the database schema. However, if we consider that the consistency of replicated copies is a specified constraint , then \\nthe two uses of the term consistency  would be related.\\nThe CAP theorem  states that it is not possible to guarantee all three  of the desirable \\nproperties—consistency, availability, and partition tolerance—at the same time in a distributed system with data replication. If this is the case, then the distributed sys-tem designer would have to choose two properties out of the three to guarantee. It is generally assumed that in many traditional (SQL) applications, guaranteeing consistency through the ACID properties is important. On the other hand, in a NOSQL distributed data store, a weaker consistency level is often acceptable, and guaranteeing the other two properties (availability, partition tolerance) is impor-tant. Hence, weaker consistency levels are often used in NOSQL system instead of guaranteeing serializability. In particular, a form of consistency known as eventual \\nconsistency  is often adopted in NOSQL systems. In Sections 24.3 through  24.6, we \\nwill discuss some of the consistency models used in specific NOSQL systems.\\nThe next four sections of this chapter discuss the characteristics of the four main cat-\\negories of NOSQL systems. We discuss document-based NOSQL systems in Sec-\\ntion\\xa024.3, and we use MongoDB as a representative system. In Section 24.4, we discuss'),\n",

In Section 24.5, we give an overview of \\ncolumn-based NOSQL systems, with a discussion of Hbase as a representative sys-tem. Finally, we introduce graph-based NOSQL systems in Section 24.6.\\n24.3  Document-Based NOSQL Systems  \\nand MongoDB\\nDocument-based or document-oriented NOSQL systems typically store data as \\ncollections  of similar documents . These types of systems are also sometimes known \\nas document stores . The individual documents somewhat resemble complex objects  \\n(see Section 12.3) or XML documents (see Chapter 13), but a major difference between document-based systems versus object and object-relational systems and XML is that there is no requirement to specify a schema—rather, the documents are specified as self-describing data  (see Section 13.1). Although the documents in a \\ncollection should be similar , they can have different data elements (attributes), and \\nnew documents can have new data elements that do not exist in any of the current documents in the collection. The system basically extracts the data element names from the self-describing documents in the collection, and the user can request that the system create indexes on some of the data elements. Documents can be speci-fied in various formats, such as XML (see Chapter 13). A popular language to spec-ify documents in NOSQL systems is JSON  (JavaScript Object Notation).\\nThere are many document-based NOSQL systems, including MongoDB and \\nCouchDB, among many others. We will give an overview of MongoDB in this sec-tion. It is important to note that different systems can use different models, lan-guages, and implementation methods, but giving a complete survey of all document-based NOSQL systems is beyond the scope of our presentation.\\n24.3.1 MongoDB Data Model\\nMongoDB documents are stored in BSON (Binary JSON) format, which is a varia-tion of JSON with some additional data types and is more efficient for storage than JSON. Individual documents  are stored in a collection . We will use a simple exam-\\nple based on our COMPANY database that we used throughout this book. The operation createCollection is used to create each collection. For example, the fol-lowing command can be used to create a collection called project  to hold PROJECT \\nobjects from the COMPANY database (see Figures 5.5 and 5.6):\\ndb.createCollection(“project” , { capped : true, size : 1310720, max : 500 } )\\nThe first parameter “project” is the name  of the collection, which is followed by an \\noptional document that specifies collection options . In our example, the collection \\nis capped ; this means it has upper limits on its storage space ( size) and number of \\ndocuments ( max ). The capping parameters help the system choose the storage \\noptions for each collection. There are other collection options, but we will not dis-cuss them here.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 921}, page_content='24.3 Document-Based NOSQL Systems and MongoDB  891\\nFor our example, we will create another document collection called worker  to \\nhold information about the EMPLOYEEs who work on each project; for example:\\ndb.createCollection(“worker” , { capped : true, size : 5242880, max : 2000 } ) )\\nEach document in a collection has a unique ObjectId  field, called _id, which is \\nautomatically indexed in the collection unless the user explicitly requests no index for the _id field. The value of ObjectId can be specified by the user , or it can be \\nsystem-generated  if the user does not specify an _id field for a particular document. \\nSystem-generated  ObjectIds have a specific format, which combines the timestamp \\nwhen the object is created (4 bytes, in an internal MongoDB format), the node id \\n(3 bytes), the process id (2 bytes), and a counter (3 bytes) into a 16-byte Id value. User-generated  ObjectsIds can have any value specified by the user as long as it \\nuniquely identifies the document and so these Ids are similar to primary keys in relational systems.\\nA collection does not have a schema. The structure of the data fields in documents \\nis chosen based on how documents will be accessed and used, and the user can choose a normalized design (similar to normalized relational tuples) or a denor-malized design (similar to XML documents or complex objects). Interdocument references can be specified by storing in one document the ObjectId or ObjectIds of other related documents. Figure 24.1(a) shows a simplified MongoDB document showing some of the data from Figure 5.6 from the COMPANY database example that is used throughout the book. In our example, the _id values are user-defined, \\nand the documents whose _id starts with P (for project) will be stored in the “project” collection, whereas those whose _id starts with W (for worker) will be stored in the “worker” collection.\\nIn Figure 24.1(a), the workers information is embedded in the project document ; so \\nthere is no need for the “worker” collection. This is known as the denormalized pat-\\ntern, which is similar to creating a complex object (see Chapter 12) or an XML \\ndocument (see Chapter 13). A list of values that is enclosed in square brackets  [ … ] \\nwithin a document represents a field whose value is an array .\\nAnother option is to use the design in Figure 24.1(b), where worker references  are \\nembedded in the project document, but the worker documents themselves are stored in a separate “worker” collection. A third option in Figure 24.1(c) would use a normalized design, similar to First Normal Form relations (see Sec-tion\\xa014.3.4). The choice of which design option to use depends on how the data \\nwill be accessed.\\nIt is important to note that the simple design in Figure 24.1(c) is not the general nor-\\nmalized design  for a many-to-many relationship, such as the one between employees \\nand projects; rather, we would need three collections for “project”, “employee”, and \\n“works_on”, as we discussed in detail in Section 9.1. Many of the design tradeoffs \\nthat were discussed in Chapters 9 and 14 (for first normal form relations and for ER-to-relational mapping options), and Chapters 12 and 13 (for complex objects and XML) are applicable for choosing the appropriate design for document structures'),\n",

In the design \\nin Figure 24.1(c), an EMPLOYEE who works on several projects would be repre-\\nsented by multiple worker documents  with different _id values; each document \\nwould represent the employee as worker for a particular project . This is similar to \\nthe design decisions for XML schema design (see Section 13.6).

Documents can be created  and inserted into their collections using \\nthe insert  operation, whose format is:\\ndb.<collection_name>.insert(<document(s)>)\\nThe parameters of the insert operation can include either a single document or an \\narray of documents, as shown in Figure 24.1(d). The delete  operation is called \\nremove , and the format is:\\ndb.<collection_name>.remove(<condition>)\\nThe documents to be removed from the collection are specified by a Boolean con-\\ndition on some of the fields in the collection documents. There is also an update  \\noperation, which has a condition to select certain documents, and a $set clause to \\nspecify the update. It is also possible to use the update operation to replace an existing document with another one but keep the same ObjectId.\\nFor read  queries, the main command is called find , and the format is:\\ndb.<collection_name>.find(<condition>)\\nGeneral Boolean conditions can be specified as <condition>, and the documents in \\nthe collection that return true  are selected for the query result.

Since MongoDB is a distributed system, the two-phase commit  method is used to ensure \\natomicity and consistency of multidocument transactions. We discussed the atomi-city and consistency properties of transactions in Section 20.3, and the two-phase commit protocol in Section 22.6.\\nReplication in MongoDB. The concept of replica set  is used in MongoDB to create \\nmultiple copies of the same data set on different nodes in the distributed system, and it uses a variation of the master-slave  approach for replication. For example, suppose \\nthat we want to replicate a particular document collection C. A replica set will have one primary copy  of the collection C stored in one node N1, and at least one \\n secondary copy  (replica) of C stored at another node N2. Additional copies can be \\nstored in nodes N3, N4, etc., as needed, but the cost of storage and update (write) increases with the number of replicas. The total number of participants in a replica set must be at least three, so if only one secondary copy is needed, a participant in the  replica set known as an arbiter  must run on the third node N3. The arbiter does not \\nhold a replica of the collection but participates in elections  to choose a new primary if \\nthe node storing the current primary copy fails. If the total number of members in a rep-lica set is n (one primary plus i secondaries, for a total of n = i +  1), then n must be an odd \\nnumber; if it is not, an arbiter  is added to ensure the election process works correctly if \\nthe primary fails. We discussed elections in distributed systems in Section 23.3.1.\\nIn MongoDB replication, all write operations must be applied to the primary copy \\nand then propagated to the secondaries. For read operations, the user can choose the particular read preference  for their application. The default read preference  \\nprocesses all reads at the primary copy, so all read and write operations are per-formed at the primary node. In this case, secondary copies are mainly to make sure that the system continues operation if the primary fails, and MongoDB can ensure that every read request gets the latest document value. To increase read perfor-mance, it is possible to set the read preference so that read requests can be processed \\nat any replica  (primary or secondary); however, a read at a secondary is not guaran-\\nteed to get the latest version of a document because there can be a delay in propa-gating writes from the primary to the secondaries.\\nSharding in MongoDB. When a collection holds a very large number of docu-\\nments or requires a large storage space, storing all the documents in one node can lead to performance problems, particularly if there are many user operations accessing the documents concurrently using various CRUD operations. Sharding  \\nof the documents in the collection—also known as horizontal partitioning —\\ndivides the documents into disjoint partitions known as shards . This allows the \\nsystem to add more nodes as needed by a process known as horizontal scaling  of \\nthe distributed system (see Section 23.1.4), and to store the shards of the collection on different nodes to achieve load balancing. Each node will process only those operations pertaining to the documents in the shard stored at that node. Also, each'),\n",

Both require that the user specify a particular \\ndocument field to be used as the basis for partitioning the documents into shards. The partitioning field —known as the shard key  in MongoDB—must have two \\ncharacteristics: it must exist in every document  in the collection, and it must have an \\nindex . The ObjectId can be used, but any other field possessing these two character-\\nistics can also be used as the basis for sharding. The values of the shard key are divided into chunks  either through range partitioning or hash partitioning, and the \\ndocuments are partitioned based on the chunks of shard key values.\\nRange partitioning  creates the chunks by specifying a range of key values; for example, \\nif the shard key values ranged from one to ten million, it is possible to create ten ranges—1 to 1,000,000; 1,000,001 to 2,000,000; … ; 9,000,001 to 10,000,000—and each chunk would contain the key values in one range. Hash partitioning  applies a \\nhash function h(K)  to each shard key K, and the partitioning of keys into chunks is \\nbased on the hash values (we discussed hashing and its advantages and disadvantages in Section 16.8). In general, if range queries  are commonly applied to a collection (for \\nexample, retrieving all documents whose shard key value is between 200 and 400), then range partitioning is preferred because each range query will typically be submit-ted to a single node that contains all the required documents in one shard. If most searches retrieve one document at a time, hash partitioning may be preferable because it randomizes the distribution of shard key values into chunks.\\nWhen sharding is used, MongoDB queries are submitted to a module called the query \\nrouter , which keeps track of which nodes contain which shards based on the particu-\\nlar partitioning method used on the shard keys. The query (CRUD operation) will be routed to the nodes that contain the shards that hold the documents that the query is requesting. If the system cannot determine which shards hold the required docu-ments, the query will be submitted to all the nodes that hold shards of the collection. Sharding and replication are used together; sharding focuses on improving perfor-mance via load balancing and horizontal scalability, whereas replication focuses on ensuring system availability when certain nodes fail in the distributed system.\\nThere are many additional details about the distributed system architecture and com-\\nponents of MongoDB, but a full discussion is outside the scope of our presentation. MongoDB also provides many other services in areas such as system administration, indexing, security, and data aggregation, but we will not discuss these features here. Full documentation of MongoDB is available online (see the bibliographic notes).\\n24.4 NOSQL Key-Value Stores\\nKey-value stores  focus on high performance, availability, and scalability by storing \\ndata in a distributed storage system.

The key is a \\nunique identifier associated with a data item and is used to locate this data item rapidly. The value  is the data item itself, and it can have very different formats for \\ndifferent key-value storage systems. In some cases, the value is just a string of bytes  \\nor an array of bytes , and the application using the key-value store has to interpret \\nthe structure of the data value. In other cases, some standard formatted data is allowed; for example, structured data rows (tuples) similar to relational data, or semistructured data using JSON or some other self-describing data format. Differ-ent key-value stores can thus store unstructured, semistructured, or structured data items (see Section 13.1). The main characteristic of key-value stores is the fact that every value (data item) must be associated with a unique key, and that retrieving the value by supplying the key must be very fast.\\nThere are many systems that fall under the key-value store label, so rather than pro-\\nvide a lot of details on one particular system, we will give a brief introductory over-view for some of these systems and their characteristics.\\n24.4.1 DynamoDB Overview\\nThe DynamoDB system is an Amazon product and is available as part of Amazon’s AWS /SDK  platforms (Amazon Web Services/Software Development Kit). It can be \\nused as part of Amazon’s cloud computing services, for the data storage component.\\nDynamoDB data model. The basic data model in DynamoDB uses the concepts \\nof tables, items, and attributes. A table  in DynamoDB does not have  a schema ; it \\nholds a collection of self-describing items . Each item  will consist of a number of \\n(attribute, value) pairs, and attribute values can be single-valued or multivalued. So basically, a table will hold a collection of items, and each item is a self-describing record (or object). DynamoDB also allows the user to specify the items in JSON for-mat, and the system will convert them to the internal storage format of DynamoDB.\\nWhen a table is created, it is required to specify a table name  and a primary key ; \\nthe primary key will be used to rapidly locate the items in the table. Thus, the pri-mary key is the key and the item is the value  for the DynamoDB key-value store. \\nThe primary key attribute must exist in every item in the table. The primary key can be one of the following two types:\\n ■A single attribute.  The DynamoDB system will use this attribute to build a \\nhash index on the items in the table. This is called a hash type primary key . \\nThe items are not ordered in storage on the value of the hash attribute.\\n ■A pair of attributes.  This is called a hash and range type primary key . The \\nprimary key will be a pair of attributes (A, B): attribute A will be used for hash-\\ning, and because there will be multiple items with the same value of A, the B \\nvalues will be used for ordering the records with the same A value. A table \\nwith this type of key can have additional secondary indexes defined on its attributes. For example, if we want to store multiple versions of some type of items in a table, we could use ItemID as hash and Date or Timestamp (when the version was created) as range in a hash and range type primary key.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 927}, page_content='24.4 NOSQL Key-Value Stores  897\\nDynamoDB Distributed Characteristics. Because DynamoDB is proprietary, in \\nthe next subsection we will discuss the mechanisms used for replication, sharding, and other distributed system concepts in an open source key-value system called Voldemort. Voldemort is based on many of the techniques proposed for DynamoDB.\\n24.4.2 Voldemort Key-Value Distributed Data Store\\nVoldemort is an open source system available through Apache 2.0 open source licens-ing rules. It is based on Amazon’s DynamoDB. The focus is on high performance and horizontal scalability, as well as on providing replication for high availability and sharding for improving latency (response time) of read and write requests. All three of those features—replication, sharding, and horizontal scalability—are realized through a technique to distribute the key-value pairs among the nodes of a distrib-uted cluster; this distribution is known as consistent hashing . Voldemort has been \\nused by LinkedIn for data storage. Some of the features of Voldemort are as follows:\\n ■Simple basic operations.  A collection of (key, value) pairs is kept in a \\nVoldemort store . In our discussion, we will assume the store is called s. The \\nbasic interface for data storage and retrieval is very simple and includes three operations: get, put, and delete. The operation s.put(k, v) inserts an item as a key-value pair with key k and value v. The operation s.delete(k) deletes the item whose key is k from the store, and the operation v = s.get(k) retrieves the value v associated with key k. The application can use these basic operations to build its own requirements. At the basic storage level, both keys and values are arrays of bytes (strings).\\n ■High-level formatted data values.  The values v in the (k, v) items can be \\nspecified in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), and the system will convert between JSON and the internal storage format. Other data object formats can also be specified if the application provides the conversion (also known as serialization ) between the user format and the storage format as a Serializer \\nclass . The Serializer class must be provided by the user and will include oper-\\nations to convert the user format into a string of bytes for storage as a value, and to convert back a string (array of bytes) retrieved via s.get(k)  into the user \\nformat. Voldemort has some built-in serializers for formats other than JSON.\\n ■Consistent hashing for distributing (key, value) pairs.  A variation of the \\ndata distribution algorithm known as consistent hashing  is used in Volde-\\nmort for data distribution among the nodes in the distributed cluster of nodes. A hash function h(k) is applied to the key k of each (k, v) pair, and \\nh(k) determines where the item will be stored. The method assumes that \\nh(k) is an integer value, usually in the range 0 to Hmax = 2\\nn−1, where n is \\nchosen based on the desired range for the hash values. This method is best \\nvisualized by considering the range of all possible integer hash values 0 to \\nHmax  to be evenly distributed on a circle (or ring). The nodes in the distrib-\\nuted system are then also located on the same ring; usually each node will have several locations on the ring (see Figure 24.2). The positioning of the points on the ring that represent the nodes is done in a psuedorandom manner.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 928}, page_content='898 Chapter 24 NOSQL Databases and Big Data Storage Systems\\nAn item ( k, v) will be stored on the node whose position in the ring follows  \\nthe position of h(k) on the ring in a clockwise direction . In Figure 24.2(a), we \\nassume there are three nodes in the distributed cluster labeled A, B, and C, where node C has a bigger capacity than nodes A and B. In a typical system, there will be many more nodes. On the circle, two instances each of A and B are placed, and three instances of C (because of its higher capacity), in a pseudorandom manner to cover the circle. Figure 24.2(a) indicates which (k, v) items are placed in which nodes based on the h(k) values.\\nCC\\nA\\nB\\nCABRange 3\\nRange 1\\nRange 2\\nRange 3Range 3Range 2\\nRange 1\\nCC\\nA\\nD\\nB\\nCADBRange 3\\nRange 1\\nRange 4\\nRange 3Range 4Range 3\\n(reduced)\\nRange 2\\n(reduced)Range 2\\nRange 1Figure 24.2 \\nExample of consistent hashing.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 929}, page_content='24.4 NOSQL Key-Value Stores  899\\n ■The h(k) values that fall in the parts of the circle marked as range 1  in Fig-\\nure\\xa024.2(a) will have their (k, v) items stored in node A because that is the node whose label follows h(k) on the ring in a clockwise direction; those in range 2  \\nare stored in node B; and those in range 3  are stored in node C. This scheme \\nallows horizontal scalability  because when a new node is added to the distrib-\\nuted system, it can be added in one or more locations on the ring depending on the node capacity. Only a limited percentage of the (k, v) items will be reas-signed to the new node from the existing nodes based on the consistent hash-ing placement algorithm. Also, those items assigned to the new node may not all come from only one of the existing nodes because the new node can have multiple locations on the ring. For example, if a node D is added and it has two placements on the ring as shown in Figure 24.2(b), then some of the items from nodes B and C would be moved to node D. The items whose keys hash to range 4  on the circle (see Figure 24.2(b)) would be migrated to node D. This \\nscheme also allows replication  by placing the number of specified replicas of \\nan item on successive nodes on the ring in a clockwise direction. The sharding  \\nis built into the method, and different items in the store (file) are located on different nodes in the distributed cluster, which means the items are horizon-tally partitioned (sharded) among the nodes in the distributed system. When a node fails, its load of data items can be distributed to the other existing nodes whose labels follow the labels of the failed node in the ring. And nodes with higher capacity can have more locations on the ring, as illustrated by node C in Figure 24.2(a), and thus store more items than smaller-capacity nodes.\\n ■Consistency and versioning.  Voldemort uses a method similar to the one \\ndeveloped for DynamoDB for consistency in the presence of replicas. Basi-\\ncally, concurrent write operations are allowed by different processes so there \\ncould exist two or more different values associated with the same key at dif-ferent nodes when items are replicated. Consistency is achieved when the item is read by using a technique known as versioning and read repair . Con-\\ncurrent writes are allowed, but each write is associated with a vector clock  \\nvalue. When a read occurs, it is possible that different versions of the same \\nvalue (associated with the same key) are read from different nodes. If the \\nsystem can reconcile to a single final value, it will pass that value to the read; otherwise, more than one version can be passed back to the application, which will reconcile the various versions into one version based on the application semantics and give this reconciled value back to the nodes.\\n24.4.3 Examples of Other Key-Value Stores\\nIn this section, we briefly review three other key-value stores. It is important to note that there are many systems that can be classified in this category, and we can only \\nmention a few of these systems.\\nOracle key-value store. Oracle has one of the well-known SQL relational data-\\nbase systems, and Oracle also offers a system based on the key-value store concept; this system is called the Oracle NoSQL Database .'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 930}, page_content='900 Chapter 24 NOSQL Databases and Big Data Storage Systems\\nRedis key-value cache and store.  Redis  differs from the other systems dis-\\ncussed here because it caches its data in main memory to further improve perfor-mance. It offers master-slave replication and high availability, and it also offers persistence by backing up the cache to disk.\\nApache Cassandra.  Cassandra  is a NOSQL system that is not easily categorized \\ninto one category; it is sometimes listed in the column-based NOSQL category (see Section 24.5) or in the key-value category. If offers features from several NOSQL categories and is used by Facebook as well as many other customers.\\n24.5  Column-Based or Wide Column  \\nNOSQL Systems\\nAnother category of NOSQL systems is known as column-based  or wide column  \\nsystems. The Google distributed storage system for big data, known as BigTable , is \\na well-known example of this class of NOSQL systems, and it is used in many Google applications that require large amounts of data storage, such as Gmail. Big-Table uses the Google File System  (GFS ) for data storage and distribution. An \\nopen source system known as Apache Hbase  is somewhat similar to Google Big-\\nTable, but it typically uses HDFS  (Hadoop Distributed File System ) for data stor-\\nage. HDFS is used in many cloud computing applications, as we shall discuss in Chapter 25. Hbase can also use Amazon’s Simple Storage System  (known as S3) \\nfor data storage. Another well-known example of column-based NOSQL systems is Cassandra, which we discussed briefly in Section 24.4.3 because it can also be char-acterized as a key-value store. We will focus on Hbase in this section as an example of this category of NOSQL systems.\\nBigTable (and Hbase) is sometimes described as a sparse multidimensional distrib-\\nuted persistent sorted map , where the word map  means a collection of (key, value) \\npairs  (the key is mapped  to the value). One of the main differences that distinguish \\ncolumn-based systems from key-value stores (see Section 24.4) is the nature of the \\nkey. In column-based systems such as Hbase, the key is multidimensional  and so \\nhas several components: typically, a combination of table name, row key, column, and timestamp. As we shall see, the column is typically composed of two compo-nents: column family and column qualifier. We discuss these concepts in more detail next as they are realized in Apache Hbase.\\n24.5.1 Hbase Data Model and Versioning\\nHbase data model. The data model in Hbase organizes data using the concepts \\nof namespaces , tables , column families , column qualifiers , columns , rows , and data \\ncells. A column is identified by a combination of (column family:column qualifier). \\nData is stored in a self-describing form by associating columns with data values, where data values are strings. Hbase also stores multiple versions  of a data item, \\nwith a timestamp  associated with each version, so versions and timestamps are also'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 931}, page_content='24.5 Column-Based or Wide Column NOSQL Systems  901\\npart of the Hbase data model (this is similar to the concept of attribute versioning in \\ntemporal databases, which we shall discuss in Section 26.2). As with other NOSQL systems, unique keys are associated with stored data items for fast access, but the keys identify cells in the storage system. Because the focus is on high performance \\nwhen storing huge amounts of data, the data model includes some storage-related concepts. We discuss the Hbase data modeling concepts and define the terminol-ogy next. It is important to note that the use of the words table , row, and column  is \\nnot identical to their use in relational databases, but the uses are related.\\n ■Tables and Rows.  Data in Hbase is stored in tables , and each table has a \\ntable name. Data in a table is stored as self-describing rows . Each row has a \\nunique row key , and row keys are strings that must have the property that \\nthey can be lexicographically ordered, so characters that do not have a lexi-cographic order in the character set cannot be used as part of a row key.\\n ■Column Families, Column Qualifiers, and Columns.  A table is associated \\nwith one or more column families . Each column family will have a name, \\nand the column families associated with a table must be specified  when the \\ntable is created and cannot be changed later. Figure 24.3(a) shows how a table \\nmay be created; the table name is followed by the names of the column fami-lies associated with the table. When the data is loaded into a table, each col-umn family can be associated with many column qualifiers , but the column \\nqualifiers are not specified  as part of creating a table. So the column qualifiers \\nmake the model a self-describing data model because the qualifiers can be dynamically specified as new rows are created and inserted into the table. A column  is specified by a combination of ColumnFamily:ColumnQualifier. \\nBasically, column families are a way of grouping together related columns (attributes in relational terminology) for storage purposes, except that the column qualifier names are not specified during table creation. Rather, they are specified when the data is created and stored in rows, so the data is self-\\ndescribing  since any column qualifier name can be used in a new row of data \\n(see Figure 24.3(b)). However, it is important that the application program-mers know which column qualifiers belong to each column family, even though they have the flexibility to create new column qualifiers on the fly when new data rows are created. The concept of column family is somewhat similar to vertical partitioning  (see Section 23.2), because columns (attri-\\nbutes) that are accessed together because they belong to the same column \\nfamily are stored in the same files. Each column family of a table is stored in \\nits own files using the HDFS file system.\\n ■Versions and Timestamps.  Hbase can keep several versions  of a data item, \\nalong with the timestamp  associated with each version. The timestamp is a \\nlong integer number that represents the system time when the version was \\ncreated, so newer versions have larger timestamp values. Hbase uses mid-\\nnight ‘January 1, 1970 UTC’ as timestamp value zero, and uses a long integer that measures the number of milliseconds since that time as the system timestamp value (this is similar to the value returned by the Java utility  java.util.Date.getTime() and is also used in MongoDB). It is also possible for'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 932}, page_content='902 Chapter 24 NOSQL Databases and Big Data Storage Systems\\nthe user to define the timestamp value explicitly in a Date format rather than \\nusing the system-generated timestamp.\\n ■Cells.  A cell holds a basic data item in Hbase. The key (address) of a cell is \\nspecified by a combination of (table, rowid, columnfamily, columnqualifier, \\ntimestamp). If timestamp is left out, the latest version of the item is retrieved \\nunless a default number of versions is specified, say the latest three versions. \\nThe default number of versions to be retrieved, as well as the default number \\nof versions that the system needs to keep, are parameters that can be speci-fied during table creation.\\n ■Namespaces.  A namespace  is a collection of tables. A namespace basically \\nspecifies a collection of one or more tables that are typically used together by user applications, and it corresponds to a database that contains a collection of tables in relational terminology.(a) creating a table:\\n create ‘EMPLOYEE’, ‘Name’, ‘Address’, ‘Details’\\n(b) inserting some row data in the EMPLOYEE table:\\n put ‘EMPLOYEE’, ‘row1’, ‘Name:Fname’, ‘John’\\n put ‘EMPLOYEE’, ‘row1’, ‘Name:Lname’, ‘Smith’\\n put ‘EMPLOYEE’, ‘row1’, ‘Name:Nickname’, ‘Johnny’\\n put ‘EMPLOYEE’, ‘row1’, ‘Details:Job’, ‘Engineer’\\n put ‘EMPLOYEE’, ‘row1’, ‘Details:Review’, ‘Good’\\n put ‘EMPLOYEE’, ‘row2’, ‘Name:Fname’, ‘Alicia’\\n put ‘EMPLOYEE’, ‘row2’, ‘Name:Lname’, ‘Zelaya’\\n put ‘EMPLOYEE’, ‘row2’, ‘Name:MName’, ‘Jennifer’\\n put ‘EMPLOYEE’, ‘row2’, ‘Details:Job’, ‘DBA’\\n put ‘EMPLOYEE’, ‘row2’, ‘Details:Supervisor’, ‘James Borg’\\n put ‘EMPLOYEE’, ‘row3’, ‘Name:Fname’, ‘James’\\n put ‘EMPLOYEE’, ‘row3’, ‘Name:Minit’, ‘E’\\n put ‘EMPLOYEE’, ‘row3’, ‘Name:Lname’, ‘Borg’\\n put ‘EMPLOYEE’, ‘row3’, ‘Name:Suffix’, ‘Jr.’\\n put ‘EMPLOYEE’, ‘row3’, ‘Details:Job’, ‘CEO’\\n put ‘EMPLOYEE’, ‘row3’, ‘Details:Salary’, ‘1,000,000’\\n(c) Some Hbase basic CRUD operations:\\n Creating a table: create <tablename>, <column family>, <column family>, …\\n Inserting Data: put <tablename>, <rowid>, <column family>:<column qualifier>, <value>\\n Reading Data (all data in a table): scan <tablename>\\n Retrieve Data (one item): get <tablename>,<rowid>Figure 24.3 \\nExamples in Hbase.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 933}, page_content='24.6 NOSQL Graph Databases and Neo4j  903\\n24.5.2 Hbase CRUD Operations\\nHbase has low-level CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations, as in many of \\nthe NOSQL systems. The formats of some of the basic CRUD operations in Hbase are shown in Figure 24.3(c).\\nHbase only provides low-level CRUD operations. It is the responsibility of the \\napplication programs to implement more complex operations, such as joins between rows in different tables. The create  operation creates a new table and spec-\\nifies one or more column families associated with that table, but it does not specify the column qualifiers, as we discussed earlier. The put operation is used for insert-\\ning new data or new versions of existing data items. The get operation is for retriev-ing the data associated with a single row in a table, and the scan  operation retrieves \\nall the rows.\\n24.5.3 Hbase Storage and Distributed System Concepts\\nEach Hbase table is divided into a number of regions , where each region will hold a \\nrange  of the row keys in the table; this is why the row keys must be lexicographically \\nordered. Each region will have a number of stores , where each column family is \\nassigned to one store within the region. Regions are assigned to region servers  \\n(storage nodes) for storage. A master server  (master node) is responsible for moni-\\ntoring the region servers and for splitting a table into regions and assigning regions \\nto region servers.\\nHbase uses the Apache Zookeeper  open source system for services related to man-\\naging the naming, distribution, and synchronization of the Hbase data on the dis-\\ntributed Hbase server nodes, as well as for coordination and replication services. \\nHbase also uses Apache HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) for distributed \\nfile services. So Hbase is built on top of both HDFS and Zookeeper. Zookeeper can itself have several replicas on several nodes for availability, and it keeps the data it needs in main memory to speed access to the master servers and region servers.\\nWe will not cover the many additional details about the distributed system architecture \\nand components of Hbase; a full discussion is outside the scope of our presentation. Full documentation of Hbase is available online (see the bibliographic notes).\\n24.6 NOSQL Graph Databases and Neo4j\\nAnother category of NOSQL systems is known as graph databases  or graph-\\noriented NOSQL  systems. The data is represented as a graph, which is a collection \\nof vertices (nodes) and edges. Both nodes and edges can be labeled to indicate the types of entities and relationships they represent, and it is generally possible to store data associated with both individual nodes and individual edges. Many sys-tems can be categorized as graph databases. We will focus our discussion on one particular system, Neo4j, which is used in many applications. Neo4j is an open source system, and it is implemented in Java. We will discuss the Neo4j data model'),\n",

Section 24.6.3 gives an overview of the distributed systems and some other characteristics of Neo4j.\\n24.6.1 Neo4j Data Model\\nThe data model in Neo4j organizes data using the concepts of nodes  and relation-\\nships . Both nodes and relationships can have properties , which store the data items \\nassociated with nodes and relationships. Nodes can have labels ; the nodes that have \\nthe same label  are grouped into a collection that identifies a subset of the nodes in \\nthe database graph for querying purposes. A node can have zero, one, or several labels. Relationships are directed; each relationship has a start node  and end node  as \\nwell as a relationship type , which serves a similar role to a node label by identifying \\nsimilar relationships that have the same relationship type. Properties can be speci-\\nfied via a map pattern , which is made of one or more “name : value” pairs enclosed \\nin curly brackets; for example \\n{Lname : ‘Smith’, Fname : ‘John’, Minit : ‘B’} .\\nIn conventional graph theory, nodes and relationships are generally called vertices  \\nand edges . The Neo4j graph data model somewhat resembles how data is repre-\\nsented in the ER and EER models (see Chapters 3 and  4) , but with some notable \\ndifferences. Comparing the Neo4j graph model with ER/EER concepts, nodes cor-\\nrespond to entities , node labels correspond to entity types and subclasses , relation-\\nships correspond to relationship instances , relationship types correspond to \\nrelationship types , and properties correspond to attributes . One notable difference \\nis that a relationship is directed  in Neo4j, but is not in ER/EER. Another is that a \\nnode may have no label in Neo4j, which is not allowed in ER/EER because every \\nentity must belong to an entity type. A third crucial difference is that the graph \\nmodel of Neo4j is used as a basis for an actual high-performance distributed data-\\nbase system whereas the ER/EER model is mainly used for database design.\\nFigure 24.4(a) shows how a few nodes can be created in Neo4j. There are various \\nways in which nodes and relationships can be created; for example, by calling appro-\\npriate Neo4j operations from various Neo4j APIs. We will just show the high-level syntax for creating nodes and relationships; to do so, we will use the Neo4j CREATE command, which is part of the high-level declarative query language Cypher . Neo4j \\nhas many options and variations for creating nodes and relationships using various scripting interfaces, but a full discussion is outside the scope of our presentation.\\n ■Labels and properties.  When a node is created, the node label can be speci-\\nfied. It is also possible to create nodes without any labels. In Figure 24.4(a), the \\nnode labels are EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT, PROJECT, and LOCATION, \\nand the created nodes correspond to some of the data from the COMPANY \\ndatabase in Figure 5.6 with a few modifications; for example, we use EmpId instead of SSN, and we only include a small subset of the data for illustration purposes. Properties are enclosed in curly brackets { … }. It is possible that some nodes have multiple labels; for example the same node can be labeled as PERSON and EMPLOYEE and MANAGER by listing all the labels separated by the colon symbol as follows: PERSON:EMPLOYEE:MANAGER. Having multiple labels is similar to an entity belonging to an entity type (PERSON)'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 935}, page_content='24.6 NOSQL Graph Databases and Neo4j  905\\nplus some subclasses of PERSON (namely EMPLOYEE and MANAGER) in \\nthe EER model (see Chapter 4) but can also be used for other purposes.\\n ■Relationships and relationship types.  Figure 24.4(b) shows a few example \\nrelationships in Neo4j based on the COMPANY database in Figure 5.6. The → specifies the direction of the relationship, but the relationship can be \\ntraversed in either direction. The relationship types (labels) in Figure 24.4(b) are WorksFor, Manager, LocatedIn, and WorksOn; only relationships with the relationship type WorksOn have properties (Hours) in Figure 24.4(b).\\n ■Paths.  A path  specifies a traversal of part of the graph. It is typically used as \\npart of a query to specify a pattern, where the query will retrieve from the graph data that matches the pattern. A path is typically specified by a start node, followed by one or more relationships, leading to one or more end nodes that satisfy the pattern. It is somewhat similar to the concepts of path expressions that we discussed in Chapters 12 and  13 in the context of query languages for object databases (OQL) and XML (XPath and XQuery).\\n ■Optional Schema.  A schema  is optional in Neo4j. Graphs can be created \\nand used without a schema, but in Neo4j version 2.0, a few schema-related \\nfunctions were added. The main features related to schema creation involve \\ncreating indexes and constraints based on the labels and properties. For example, it is possible to create the equivalent of a key constraint on a prop-erty of a label, so all nodes in the collection of nodes associated with the label \\nmust have unique values for that property.\\n ■Indexing and node identifiers.  When a node is created, the Neo4j system \\ncreates an internal unique system-defined identifier for each node. To \\nretrieve individual nodes using other properties of the nodes efficiently, the \\nuser can create indexes  for the collection of nodes that have a particular \\nlabel. Typically, one or more of the properties of the nodes in that collection can be indexed. For example, Empid can be used to index nodes with the EMPLOYEE label, Dno to index the nodes with the DEPARTMENT label, and Pno to index the nodes with the PROJECT label.\\n24.6.2 The Cypher Query Language of Neo4j\\nNeo4j has a high-level query language, Cypher. There are declarative commands for creating nodes and relationships (see Figures 24.4(a) and (b)), as well as for finding nodes and relationships based on specifying patterns. Deletion and modification of data is also possible in Cypher. We introduced the CREATE command in the previous section, so we will now give a brief overview of some of the other features of Cypher.\\nA Cypher query is made up of clauses . When a query has several clauses, the result \\nfrom one clause can be the input to the next clause in the query. We will give a fla-\\nvor of the language by discussing some of the clauses using examples. Our presenta-tion is not meant to be a detailed presentation on Cypher, just an introduction to some of the languages features. Figure 24.4(c) summarizes some of the main clauses that can be part of a Cyber query. The Cyber language can specify complex queries and updates on a graph database. We will give a few of examples to illustrate simple Cyber queries in Figure 24.4(d).'),\n",

Query 3, on the other hand, returns the employees and hours \\nper week who work on the project with Pno = 2. Query 4 illustrates the ORDER BY clause and returns all employees and the projects they work on, sorted by Ename. It is also possible to limit the number of returned results by using the LIMIT clause as in query 5, which only returns the first 10 answers.\\nQuery 6 illustrates the use of WITH and aggregation, although the WITH clause can \\nbe used to separate clauses in a query even if there is no aggregation. Query 6 also illus-\\ntrates the WHERE clause to specify additional conditions, and the query returns the employees who work on more than two projects, as well as the number of projects each employee works on. It is also common to return the nodes and relationships them-selves in the query result, rather than the property values of the nodes as in the previ-ous queries. Query 7 is similar to query 5 but returns the nodes and relationships only, and so the query result can be displayed as a graph using Neo4j’s visualization tool. It is also possible to add or remove labels and properties from nodes. Query 8 shows how to add more properties to a node by adding a Job property to an employee node.\\nThe above gives a brief flavor for the Cypher query language of Neo4j. The full lan-\\nguage manual is available online (see the bibliographic notes).\\n24.6.3  Neo4j Interfaces and Distributed System Characteristics\\nNeo4j has other interfaces that can be used to create, retrieve, and update nodes and \\nrelationships in a graph database. It also has two main versions: the enterprise edi-tion, which comes with additional capabilities, and the community edition. We dis-cuss some of the additional features of Neo4j in this subsection.\\n ■Enterprise edition vs. community edition.  Both editions support the Neo4j \\ngraph data model and storage system, as well as the Cypher graph query language, and several other interfaces, including a high-performance native API, language drivers for several popular programming languages, such as Java, Python, PHP, and the REST (Representational State Transfer) API. In addition, both editions support ACID properties. The enterprise edition supports additional features for enhancing performance, such as caching and clustering of data and locking.\\n ■Graph visualization interface.  Neo4j has a graph visualization interface, so \\nthat a subset of the nodes and edges in a database graph can be displayed as a graph. This tool can be used to visualize query results in a graph representation.\\n ■Master-slave replication.  Neo4j can be configured on a cluster of distrib-\\nuted system nodes (computers), where one node is designated the master node. The data and indexes are fully replicated on each node in the cluster. Various ways of synchronizing the data between master and slave nodes can be configured in the distributed cluster.\\n ■Caching.  A main memory cache can be configured to store the graph data \\nfor improved performance.\\n ■Logical logs.  Logs can be maintained to recover from failures.'),\n",

Full documentation of Neo4j is available online (see the biblio-graphic notes).\\n24.7 Summary\\nIn this chapter, we discussed the class of database systems known as NOSQL sys-tems, which focus on efficient storage and retrieval of large amounts of “big data.” Applications that use these types of systems include social media, Web links, user profiles, marketing and sales, posts and tweets, road maps and spatial data, and e-mail. The term NOSQL  is generally interpreted as Not Only SQL—rather than \\nNO to SQL—and is meant to convey that many applications need systems other than traditional relational SQL systems to augment their data management needs. These systems are distributed databases or distributed storage systems, with a focus on semistructured data storage, high performance, availability, data replication, and scalability rather than an emphasis on immediate data consistency, powerful query languages, and structured data storage.\\nIn Section 24.1, we started with an introduction to NOSQL systems, their charac-\\nteristics, and how they differ from SQL systems. Four general categories of NOSQL systems are document-based, key-value stores, column-based, and graph-based. In Section 24.2, we discussed how NOSQL systems approach the issue of consis-tency among multiple replicas (copies) by using the paradigm known as eventual consistency. We discussed the CAP theorem, which can be used to understand the emphasis of NOSQL systems on availability. In Sections 24.3 through  24.6, we presented an overview of each of the four main categories of NOSQL systems—starting with document-based systems in Section 24.3, followed by key-value stores in Section 24.4, then column-based systems in Section 24.5, and finally graph-based systems in Section 24.6. We also noted that some NOSQL systems may not fall neatly into a single category but rather use techniques that span two or more categories.\\nReview Questions\\n 24.1.

The early search engines—namely, AltaVista (which was acquired by Yahoo in 2003 and which later became the Yahoo! search engine) and Lycos (which was also a search engine and a Web portal—were established soon after the Web came along. They were later overshadowed by the likes of Google and Bing. Then came an array of social networks such as Facebook, launched in 2004, and Twitter, founded in 2006. LinkedIn, a professional network launched in 2003, boasts over 250 million users worldwide. Facebook has over 1.3 billion users worldwide today; of these, about 800 million are active on Facebook daily. Twitter had an estimated 980 million users in early 2014 and it was reported to have reached the rate of 1 bil-lion tweets per day in October 2012. These statistics are updated continually and are easily available on the Web.\\nOne major implication of the establishment and exponential growth of the Web, \\nwhich brought computing to laypeople worldwide, is that ordinary people started creating all types of transactions and content that generate new data. These users and consumers of multimedia data require systems to deliver user-specific data instantaneously from mammoth stores of data at the same time that they create huge amounts of data themselves. The result is an explosive growth in the amount of data generated and communicated over networks worldwide; in addition, businesses and governmental institutions electronically record every transaction of each customer, vendor, and supplier and thus have been accumulating data in so-called data ware-houses (to be discussed in Chapter 29).

And, of course, we must consider the data generated daily from satellite imagery and communication networks.\\nThis phenomenal growth of data generation means that the amount of data in a single \\nrepository can be numbered in petabytes (10 **15 bytes, which approximates to 2 **50 \\nbytes) or terabytes (e.g., 1,000 terabytes). The term big data  has entered our common \\nparlance and refers to such massive amounts of data. The McKinsey report\\n2 defines \\nthe term big data  as datasets whose size exceeds the typical reach of a DBMS to capture, \\nstore, manage, and analyze that data. The meaning and implications of this data onslaught are reflected in some of the facts mentioned in the McKinsey report:\\n ■A $600 disk can store all of the world’s music today.\\n ■Every month, 30 billion of items of content are stored on Facebook.\\n ■More data is stored in 15 of the 17 sectors of the U.S. economy than is stored \\nin the Library of Congress, which, as of 2011, stored 235 terabytes of data.\\n ■There is currently a need for over 140,000 deep-data-analysis positions and \\nover 1.5 million data-savvy managers in the United States. Deep data analy-\\nsis involves more knowledge discovery type analyses.\\nBig data is everywhere, so every sector of the economy stands to benefit by harness-\\ning it appropriately with technologies that will help data users and managers make \\nbetter decisions based on historical evidence. According to the Mckinsey report,\\nIf the U.S. healthcare [system] could use the big data creatively and effectively to \\ndrive efficiency and quality, we estimate that the potential value from data in the sector could be more than $300 billion in value every year.\\nBig data has created countless opportunities to give consumers information in a \\ntimely manner—information that will prove useful in making decisions, discover-\\ning needs and improving performance, customizing products and services, giving decision makers more effective algorithmic tools, and creating value by innovations in terms of new products, services, and business models.

We focus on those technologies that can be attributed to the MapReduce/Hadoop ecosystem, which covers most of the ground of open source projects for big data applications. We will not be able to get into the applications of the big data technology for analytics. That is a vast area by itself. Some of the basic data mining concepts are mentioned in Chapter 28; however, today’s analytics offerings go way beyond the basic concepts we have outlined there.\\nIn Section 25.1, we introduce the essential features of big data.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 944}, page_content='914 Chapter 25 Big Data Technologies Based on MapReduce and Hadoop\\n25.1 What Is Big Data?\\nBig data  is becoming a popular and even a fashionable term. People use this term \\nwhenever a large amount of data is involved with some analysis; they think that using this term will make the analysis look like an advanced application. However, the term big data  legitimately refers to datasets whose size is beyond the ability of \\ntypical database software tools to capture, store, manage, and analyze. In today’s environment, the size of datasets that may be considered as big data ranges from terabytes (10 **12 bytes), or petabytes (10 **15 bytes), to exabytes (10 **18 bytes). \\nThe notion of what is Big data will depend on the industry, how data is used, how \\nmuch historical data is involved and many other characteristics. The Gartner \\nGroup, a popular enterprise-level organization that industry looks up to for learn-\\ning about trends, characterized big data in 2011 by the three V’s: volume, velocity, \\nand variety. Other characteristics, such as veracity and value, have been added to the definition by other researchers. Let us briefly see what these stand for.\\nVolume.  The volume of data obviously refers to the size of data managed by the \\nsystem. Data that is somewhat automatically generated tends to be voluminous. Examples include sensor data, such as the data in manufacturing or processing plants generated by sensors; data from scanning equipment, such as smart card and credit card readers; and data from measurement devices, such as smart meters or environmental recording devices.\\nThe industrial internet of things  (IIOT or IOT) is expected to bring about a revo-\\nlution that will improve the operational efficiency of enterprises and open up new frontiers for harnessing intelligent technologies. The IOT will cause billions of devices to be connected to the Internet because these devices generate data continu-ously. For example, in gene sequencing, next generation sequencing (NGS) tech-nology means that the volume of gene sequence data will be increased exponentially.\\nMany additional applications are being developed and are slowly becoming a real-\\nity. These applications include using remote sensing to detect underground sources of energy, environmental monitoring, traffic monitoring and regulation by auto-matic sensors mounted on vehicles and roads, remote monitoring of patients using special scanners and equipment, and tighter control and replenishment of invento-ries using radio-frequency identification (RFID) and other technologies. All these developments will have associated with them a large volume of data. Social net-works such as Twitter and Facebook have hundreds of millions of subscribers worldwide who generate new data with every message they send or post they make. Twitter hit a half billion tweets daily in October 2012.\\n5 The amount of data required \\nto store one second of high-definition video may equal 2,000 pages of text data. \\nThus, the multimedia data being uploaded on YouTube and similar video hosting platforms is significantly more voluminous than simple numeric or text data. In \\n2010, enterprises stored over 13 exabytes (10 **18 bytes) of data, which amounts to \\nover 50,000 times the amount of data stored by the Library of Congress.\\n6\\n5See Terdiman (2012): http://www.cnet.com/news/report-twitter-hits-half-a-billion-tweets-a-day/\\n6From Jagadish et al.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 945}, page_content='25.1 What Is Big Data?  915\\nVelocity.  The definition of big data  goes beyond the dimension of volume; it \\nincludes the types and frequency of data that are disruptive to traditional database management tools. The Mckinsey report on big data\\n7 described velocity as the \\nspeed at which data is created, accumulated, ingested, and processed. High velocity is attributed to data when we consider the typical speed of transactions on stock exchanges; this speed reaches billions of transactions per day on certain days. If we must process these transactions to detect potential fraud or we must process bil-lions of call records on cell phones daily to detect malicious activity, we face the velocity dimension. Real-time data and streaming data are accumulated by the likes of Twitter and Facebook at a very high velocity. Velocity is helpful in detecting trends among people that are tweeting a million tweets every three minutes. Pro-cessing of streaming data for analysis also involves the velocity dimension.\\nVariety.  Sources of data in traditional applications were mainly transactions \\ninvolving financial, insurance, travel, healthcare, retail industries, and governmen-tal and judicial processing. The types of sources have expanded dramatically and include Internet data (e.g., clickstream and social media), research data (e.g., sur-veys and industry reports), location data (e.g., mobile device data and geospatial data), images (e.g., surveillance, satellites and medical scanning), e-mails, supply chain data (e.g., EDI—electronic data interchange, vendor catalogs), signal data (e.g., sensors and RFID devices), and videos (YouTube enters hundreds of minutes of video every minute). Big data includes structured, semistructured, and unstruc-tured data (see discussion in Chapter 26) in different proportions based on context.\\nStructured data feature a formally structured data model, such as the relational \\nmodel, in which data are in the form of tables containing rows and columns, and a hierarchical database in IMS, which features record types as segments and fields within a record.\\nUnstructured data have no identifiable formal structure. We discussed systems like \\nMongoDB (in Chapter 24), which stores unstructured document-oriented data, and Neo4j, which stores data in the form of a graph. Other forms of unstructured data include e-mails and blogs, PDF files, audio, video, images, clickstreams, and Web contents. The advent of the World Wide Web in 1993–1994 led to tremen-dous growth in unstructured data. Some forms of unstructured data may fit into a \\nformat that allows well-defined tags that separate semantic elements; this format \\nmay include the capability to enforce hierarchies within the data. XML is hierarchi-cal in its descriptive mechanism, and various forms of XML have come about in many domains; for example, biology (bioML—biopolymer markup language), GIS (gML—geography markup language), and brewing (BeerXML—language for exchange of brewing data), to name a few. Unstructured data constitutes the major challenge in today’s big data systems.\\nVeracity.  The veracity dimension of big data is a more recent addition than the \\nadvent of the Internet. Veracity has two built-in features: the credibility of the source, and the suitability of data for its target audience. It is closely related to trust; \\n7See Mckinsey (2013).'),\n",

Many sources of data generate data that is uncertain, incomplete, and inaccurate, therefore making its veracity questionable.\\nWe now turn our attention to the technologies that are considered the pillars of big \\ndata technologies. It is anticipated that by 2016, more than half of the data in the world may be processed by Hadoop-related technologies. It is therefore important for us to trace the MapReduce/Hadoop revolution and understand how this tech-nology is positioned today. The historical development starts with the program-ming paradigm called MapReduce programming.\\n25.2 Introduction to MapReduce and Hadoop\\nIn this section, we will introduce the technology for big data analytics and data pro-\\ncessing known as Hadoop, an open source implementation of the MapReduce pro-gramming model. The two core components of Hadoop are the MapReduce programming paradigm and HDFS, the Hadoop Distributed File System. We will briefly explain the background behind Hadoop and then MapReduce. Then we will make some brief remarks about the Hadoop ecosystem and the Hadoop releases.\\n25.2.1 Historical Background\\nHadoop has originated from the quest for an open source search engine. The first attempt was made by the then Internet archive director Doug Cutting and Univer-sity of Washington graduate student Mike Carafella. Cutting and Carafella devel-oped a system called Nutch that could crawl and index hundreds of millions of Web pages. It is an open source Apache project.\\n8 After Google released the Google File \\nSystem9 paper in October 2003 and the MapReduce programming paradigm \\npaper10 in December 2004, Cutting and Carafella realized that a number of things \\nthey were doing could be improved based on the ideas in these two papers. They \\nbuilt an underlying file system and a processing framework that came to be known \\nas Hadoop (which used Java as opposed to the C++ used in MapReduce) and ported Nutch on top of it. In 2006, Cutting joined Yahoo, where there was an effort under way to build open source technologies using ideas from the Google File System and the MapReduce programming paradigm. Yahoo wanted to enhance its search pro-cessing and build an open source infrastructure based on the Google File System and MapReduce. Yahoo spun off the storage engine and the processing parts of Nutch as Hadoop  (named after the stuffed elephant toy of Cutting’s son). The \\n8For documentation on Nutch, see http:nutch.apache.org\\n9Ghemawat, Gbioff, and Leung (2003).\\n10Dean and Ghemawat (2004).'),\n",

However, the circa 2006 Hadoop could only run on a handful of nodes. Later, Yahoo set up a research forum for the company’s data sci-entists; doing so improved the search relevance and ad revenue of the search engine and at the same time helped to mature the Hadoop technology. In 2011, Yahoo spun off Hortonworks as a Hadoop-centered software company. By then, Yahoo’s infrastructure contained hundreds of petabytes of storage and 42,000 nodes in the cluster. In the years since Hadoop became an open source Apache project, thou-sands of developers worldwide have contributed to it. A joint effort by Google, IBM, and NSF used a 2,000-node Hadoop cluster at a Seattle data center and helped further universities’ research on Hadoop. Hadoop has seen tremendous growth since the 2008 launch of Cloudera as the first commercial Hadoop company and the subsequent mushrooming of a large number of startups. IDC, a software indus-try market analysis firm, predicts that the Hadoop market will surpass $800 million in 2016; IDC predicts that the big data market will hit $23 billion in 2016. For more details about the history of Hadoop, consult a four-part article by Harris.\\n11\\nAn integral part of Hadoop is the MapReduce programming framework. Before we go any further, let us try to understand what the MapReduce programming paradigm is all about. We defer a detailed discussion of the HDFS file system to Section 25.3.\\n25.2.2 MapReduce\\nThe MapReduce programming model and runtime environment was first described by Jeffrey Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat (Dean & Ghemawat (2004)) based on their work at Google. Users write their programs in a functional style of map  and reduce  \\ntasks, which are automatically parallelized and executed on large clusters of com-modity hardware. The programming paradigm has existed as far back as the lan-guage LISP, which was designed by John McCarthy in late 1950s. However, the reincarnation of this way of doing parallel programming and the way this paradigm was implemented at Google gave rise to a new wave of thinking that contributed to the subsequent developments of technologies such as Hadoop. The runtime system handles many of the messy engineering aspects of parallelization, fault tolerance, data distribution, load balancing, and management of task communication. As long as users adhere to the contracts  laid out by the MapReduce system, they can just \\nfocus on the logical aspects of this program; this allows programmers without dis-tributed systems experience to perform analysis on very large datasets.\\nThe motivation behind the MapReduce system was the years spent by the authors \\nand others at Google implementing hundreds of special-purpose computations on large datasets (e.g., computing inverted indexes from Web content collected via Web crawling; building Web graphs; and extracting statistics from Web logs, such as frequency distribution of search requests by topic, by region, by type of user, etc.). Conceptually, these tasks are not difficult to express; however, given the scale \\n11Derreck Harris : ‘The history of Hadoop: from 4 nodes to the future of data,” at https://gigaom.com/ \\n2013/03/04/the-history-of-hadoop-from-4-nodes-to-the-future-of-data/'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 948}, page_content='918 Chapter 25 Big Data Technologies Based on MapReduce and Hadoop\\nof data in billions of Web pages and with the data spread over thousands of \\nmachines, the execution task was nontrivial. Issues of program control and data management, data distribution, parallelization of computation, and handling of failures became critically important.\\nThe MapReduce programming model and runtime environment was designed to \\ncope with the above complexity. The abstraction is inspired by the map and reduce \\nprimitives present in LISP and many other functional languages. An underlying \\nmodel of data is assumed; this model treats an object of interest in the form of a unique key that has associated content or value. This is the key-value pair. Surpris-ingly, many computations can be expressed as applying a map operation to each logical “record” that produces a set of intermediate key-value pairs and then apply-ing a reduce operation to all the values that shared the same key (the purpose of sharing is to combine the derived data). This model allows the infrastructure to parallelize large computations easily and to use re-execution as the primary mecha-nism for fault tolerance. The idea of providing a restricted programming model so that the runtime can parallelize computations automatically is not new.  MapReduce is the enhancement of those existing ideas. As it is understood today, MapReduce is a fault-tolerant implementation and a runtime environment that scales to thousands \\nof processors. The programmer is spared the worry of handling failures. In sub-sequent sections, we will abbreviate MapReduce as MR.\\nThe MapReduce Programming Model In the following description, we use the \\nformalism and description as it was originally described by Dean and Ghemawat (2010).\\n12 The map and reduce functions have the following general form:\\nmap[K1,V1] which is (key, value) : List[K2,V2] and\\nreduce(K2, List[V2]) : List[K3,V3]\\nMap  is a generic function that takes a key of type K1 and a value of type V1 and \\nreturns a list of key-value pairs of type K2 and V2. Reduce  is a generic function that \\ntakes a key of type K2 and a list of values of type V2 and returns pairs of type \\n(K3,V3) . In general, the types K1, K2, K3, etc., are different, with the only require-\\nment that the output types from the Map function must match the input type of the \\nReduce function.\\nThe basic execution workflow of MapReduce is shown in Figure 25.1.Assume that we have a document and we want to make a list of words in it with \\ntheir corresponding frequencies. This ubiquitous word count  example quoted \\ndirectly from Dean and Ghemawat (2004) above goes as follows in pseudocode:\\nMap (String key, String value):\\nfor each word w in value Emitintermediate (w, “1”);\\nHere key is the document name, and value is the text content of the document.\\n12Jeffrey Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat, “MapReduce: Simplified Data Processing on Large Clusters,” in \\nOSDI (2004).'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 949}, page_content='25.2 Introduction to MapReduce and Hadoop  919\\nThen the above lists of (word, 1) pairs are added up to output total counts of all \\nwords found in the document as follows:\\nReduce (String key, Iterator values) : // here the key is a word and values are \\nlists of its counts //\\n Int result =0;\\n For each v in values :\\n  result += Parseint (v);\\n Emit (key, Asstring (result));\\nThe above example in MapReduce programming appears as:\\nmap [LongWritable,Text](key, value) : List[Text, LongWritable] = {\\n String[] words = split(value)\\n for(word : words) {  context.out(Text(word), LongWritable(1)) }}reduce [Text, Iterable[LongWritable]](key, values) : List[Text, LongWritable] = {\\n LongWritable c = 0\\n for( v : values) {  c += v }\\n context.out(key,c) }\\nThe data types used in the above example are LongWritable and Text. Each \\nMapReduce job must register a Map and Reduce function. The Map function receives each key-value pair and on each call can output 0 or more key-value pairs. The signature of the Map function specifies the data types of its input and output Split 0 MapSort\\nCopy\\nMerge\\nReduceOutput\\nfile 0OutputInput\\nReduceMergeMap\\nMapSplit 1\\nSplit 2Output\\nfile 1\\nFigure 25.1 \\nOverview of MapReduce execution.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 950}, page_content='920 Chapter 25 Big Data Technologies Based on MapReduce and Hadoop\\nkey-value pairs. The Reduce function receives a key and an iterator of values asso-\\nciated with that key. It can output one or more key-value pairs on each invocation. Again, the signature of the Reduce function indicates the data types of its inputs and outputs. The output type of the Map must match the input type of the Reduce function. In the wordcount example, the map function receives each line as a value, splits it into words, and emits (via the function context.out) a row for each word with frequency 1. Each invocation of the Reduce function receives for a given word the list of frequencies computed on the Map side. It adds these and emits each word and its frequency as output. The functions interact with a context.  The \\ncontext is used to interact with the framework. It is used by clients to send config-uration information to tasks; and tasks can use it to get access to HDFS and read data directly from HDFS, to output key-value pairs, and to send status (e.g., task counters) back to the client.\\nThe MapReduce way of implementing some other functions based on Dean and \\nGhemawat (2004) is as follows:\\nDistributed Grep\\nGrep looks for a given pattern in a file. The Map function emits a line if it \\nmatches a supplied pattern. The Reduce function is an identity function that copies the supplied intermediate data to the output. This is an example of a Map only task ; there is no need to incur the cost of a Shuffle . We will provide \\nmore information when we explain the MapReduce runtime.\\nReverse Web-Link Graph\\nThe purpose here is to output (target URL, source URL) pairs for each link to a \\ntarget page found in a page named source. The Reduce function concatenates the list of all source URLs associated with a given target URL and emits the pair <target, list(source)>.\\nInverted Index\\nThe purpose is to build an inverted index based on all words present in a docu-\\nment repository. The Map function parses each document and emits a sequence of (word, document_id) pairs. The Reduce function takes all pairs for a given word, sorts them by document_id and emits a (word, list (document_id)) pair. The set of all these pairs forms an inverted index.\\nThese illustrative applications give a sense of the MapReduce programming model’s \\nbroad applicability and the ease of expressing the application’s logic using the Map and Reduce phases.\\nA Job in MapReduce comprises the code for the Map and Reduce (usually pack-\\naged as a jar) phases, a set of artifacts needed to run the tasks (such as files, other jars, and archives) and, most importantly, a set of properties specified in a configu-ration. There are hundreds of properties that can be specified, but the core ones are as follows:\\n ■the Map task\\n ■the Reduce task'),\n",

It provides a set of interfaces to monitor running Jobs. See the Hadoop Wiki\\n13 for further details about the workings of the JobTracker.\\n25.2.3 Hadoop Releases\\nSince the advent of Hadoop as a new distributed framework to run MapReduce programs, various releases have been produced:\\nThe 1.x releases of Hadoop are a continuation of the original 0.20 code base. \\nSubreleases with this line have added Security, additional HDFS and MapRe duce \\nimprovements to support HBase, a better MR programming model, as well as other improvements.\\nThe 2.x releases include the following major features:\\n /box4YARN (Y et Another Resource Navigator) is a general resource manager \\nextracted out of the JobTracker from MR version1.\\n /box4A new MR runtime that runs on top of YARN.\\n /box4Improved HDFS that supports federation and increased availability.\\nAt the time of this writing, Hadoop 2.0 has been around for about a year. The \\nadoption is rapidly picking up; but a significant percentage of Hadoop deployments still run on Hadoop v1.\\n25.3 Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)\\nAs we said earlier, in addition to MapReduce, the other core component of Hadoop is the underlying file system HDFS. In this section, we will first explain the architec-ture of HDFS, then describe the file input/output operations supported in HDFS, and finally comment on the scalability of HDFS.\\n25.3.1 HDFS Preliminaries\\nThe Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is the file system component of Hadoop and is designed to run on a cluster of commodity hardware. HDFS is pat-terned after the UNIX file system; however, it relaxes a few POSIX (portable oper-ating system interface) requirements to enable streaming access to file system data. HDFS provides high-throughput access to large datasets. HDFS stores file system \\n13Hadoop Wiki is at http://hadoop.apache.org/'),\n",

Whereas the metadata is stored on a \\ndedicated server, called the NameNode, the application data is stored on other servers, called DataNodes. All servers are fully connected and communicate with each other using TCP-based protocols. To make data durable, the file content is replicated on multiple DataNodes, as in the Google File System. This not only increases reliability, but it also multiplies the bandwidth for data transfer and enables colocation of computation with data. It was designed with the following assumptions and goals:\\nHardware failure:  Using commodity hardware, failure of hardware is the \\nnorm rather than an exception. Therefore, with thousands of nodes, automatic detection and recovery from failures becomes a must.\\nBatch processing:  HDFS has been primarily designed for batch rather than \\ninteractive use. High throughput is emphasized over low latency of data access. Full scans of files are typical.\\nLarge datasets:  HDFS was designed to support huge files in the hundreds of \\ngigabytes to terabytes range.\\nSimple coherency model:  HDFS applications need a one writer and many \\nreader access models for files. File content cannot be updated, but only appended. This model alleviates coherency issues among copies of data.\\n25.3.2 Architecture of HDFS\\nHDFS has a master-slave architecture. The master server, called the NameNode , \\nmanages the file system storage area or namespace ; Clients access the namespace \\nthrough the Namenode. The slaves called DataNodes  run on a cluster of commod-\\nity machines, usually one per machine. They manage the storage attached to the \\nnode that they run on. The namespace itself comprises Files and Directories. The Namenodes maintain inodes  (index nodes) about File and Directories with attri-\\nbutes like ownership, permissions, creation and access times, and disk space quotas. Using inodes, the mapping of File blocks to DataNodes is determined. DataNodes are responsible for serving read and write requests from clients. DataNodes per-form block creation, deletion, and replication operations as instructed by the NameNode. A cluster can have thousands of DataNodes and tens of thousands of HDFS clients simultaneously connected.\\nTo read a file, a client first connects to the NameNode and obtains the locations of \\nthe data blocks in the file it wants to access; it then connects directly with the DataNodes that house the blocks and reads the data.\\nThe architecture of HDFS has the following highlights:\\n  1. HDFS allows a decoupling of metadata from data operations. Metadata \\noperations are fast whereas data transfers are much slower. If the location \\nof metadata and transfer of data are not decoupled, speed suffers in a dis-\\ntributed environment because data transfer dominates and slows the \\nresponse.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 953}, page_content='25.3 Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)  923\\n  2. Replication is used to provide reliability and high availability. Each block is \\nreplicated (default is three copies) to a number of nodes in the cluster. The highly contentious files like MapReduce job libraries would have a higher number of replicas to reduce network traffic.\\n  3. The network traffic is kept to a minimum. For reads, clients are directed to the closest DataNode. As far as possible, a local file system read is attempted and involves no network traffic; the next choice is a copy on a node on the same rack before going to another rack. For writes, to reduce network band-width utilization, the first copy is written to the same node as the client. For other copies, travel across racks is minimized.\\nNameNode. The NameNode maintains an image  of the file system comprising \\ni-nodes and corresponding block locations. Changes to the file system are main-\\ntained in a Write-ahead commit log (see the discussion of Write-ahead logs in \\nChapter 22) called the Journal . Checkpoints are taken for purposes of recovery; \\nthey represent a persistent record of the image without the dynamic information related to the block placement. Block placement information is obtained from the DataNodes periodically as described below. During Restart, the image is restored to the last checkpoint and the journal entries are applied to that image. A new checkpoint and empty journal are created so that the NameNode can start accepting new client requests. The startup time of a NameNode is proportional to the Journal file’s size. Merging the checkpoint with the Journal periodically reduces restart time.\\nNote that with the above architecture, it is catastrophic to have any corruption of \\nthe Checkpoint or the Journal. To guard against corruption, both are written to multiple directories on different volumes.\\nSecondary NameNodes. These are additional NameNodes that can be created \\nto perform either the checkpointing role or a backup role. A Checkpoint node peri-odically combines existing checkpoint and journal files. In backup mode, it acts like another storage location for the Journal for the primary NameNode. The backup NameNode remains up-to-date with the file system and can take over on failure. In Hadoop V1, this takeover must be done manually.\\nDataNodes: Blocks are stored on a DataNode in the node’s native file system. The \\nNameNode directs clients to the DataNodes that contain a copy of the block they want to read. Each block has its representation in two files in the native file system: a file containing the data and a second file containing the metadata, which includes the checksums for the block data and the block’s generation stamp. DataNodes and NameNodes do not communicate directly but via a so-called heartbeat mechanism , \\nwhich refers to a periodic reporting of the state by the DataNode to the NameNode; the report is called a Block Report. The report contains the block id, the generation stamp, and the length for each block. The block locations are not part of the namespace image. They must be obtained from the block reports, and they change as blocks are moved around. The MapReduce Job Tracker, along with the'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 954}, page_content='924 Chapter 25 Big Data Technologies Based on MapReduce and Hadoop\\nNameNode, uses the latest block report information for scheduling purposes. In \\nresponse to a heartbeat from the DataNode, the NameNode sends one of the following types of commands to the DataNode:\\n ■Replicate a block to another node.\\n ■Remove a block replica.\\n ■Reregister the node or shut down the node.\\n ■Send an immediate block report.\\n25.3.3 File I/O Operations and Replica Management in HDFS\\nHDFS provides a single-writer, multiple-reader model. Files cannot be updated, but \\nonly appended. A file consists of blocks. Data is written in 64-KB packets in a write \\npipeline , which is set up to minimize network utilization, as we described above. \\nData written to the last block becomes available only after an explicit hflush opera-tion. Simultaneous reading by clients is possible while data is being written. A checksum is generated and stored for each block and is verified by the client to detect corruption of data. Upon detection of a corrupt block, the Namenode is noti-fied; it initiates a process to replicate the block and instructs the Datanode to remove \\nthe corrupt block. During the read operation, an attempt is made to fetch a replica \\nfrom as close a node as possible by ordering the nodes in ascending order of dis-tance from the client. A read fails when the Datanode is unavailable, when the checksum test fails, or when the replica is no longer on the Datanode. HDFS has been optimized for batch processing similar to MapReduce.\\nBlock Placement. Nodes of a Hadoop cluster are typically spread across many \\nracks. They are normally organized such that nodes on a rack share a switch, and rack switches are connected to a high-speed switch at the upper level. For example, the rack level may have a 1-Gb switch, whereas at the top level there may be a 10-Gb switch. HDFS estimates the network bandwidth between Datanodes based on their distance. Datanodes on the same physical node have a distance of 0, on the same rack are distance 2 away, and on different racks are distance 4 away. The default HDFS block placement policy balances between minimizing the write cost and maximizing data reliability and availability as well as aggregate read bandwidth. Network bandwidth consumed is estimated based on distance among DataNodes. Thus, for DataNodes on the same physical node, the distance is 0, whereas on the same rack it is 2 and on a different rack it is 4. The ultimate goal of block placement is to minimize the write cost while maximizing data availability and reliability as well as available bandwidth for reading. Replicas are managed so that there is at least one on the original node of the client that created it, and others are distributed among other racks. Tasks are preferred to be run on nodes where the data resides; three replicas gives the scheduler enough leeway to place tasks where the data is.\\nReplica Management. Based on the block reports from the DataNodes, the \\nNameNode tracks the number of replicas and the location of each block. A replica-tion priority queue contains blocks that need to be replicated. A background thread'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 955}, page_content='25.3 Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)  925\\nmonitors this queue and instructs a DataNode to create replicas and distribute \\nthem across racks. NameNode prefers to have as many different racks as possible to host replicas of a block. Overreplicated blocks cause some replicas to be removed based on space utilization of the DataNodes.\\n25.3.4 HDFS Scalability\\nSince we are discussing big data technologies in this chapter, it is apropos to discuss some limits of scalability in HDFS. Hadoop program management committee member Shvachko commented that the Yahoo HDFS cluster had achieved the fol-lowing levels as opposed to the intended targets (Shvachko, 2010). The numbers in parentheses are the targets he listed. Capacity: 14 petabytes (vs. 10 petabytes); num-ber of nodes: 4,000 (vs. 10,000); clients:15,000 (vs. 100,000); and files: 60 million (vs.\\xa0100 million). Thus, Yahoo had come very close to its intended targets in 2010, with a smaller cluster of 4,000 nodes and fewer clients; but Yahoo had actually exceeded the target with respect to total amount of data handled.\\nSome of the observations made by Shvachko (2010) are worth mentioning. They \\nare based on the HDFS configuration used at Yahoo in 2010. We present the actual and estimated numbers below to give the reader a sense of what is involved in these gigantic data processing environments.\\n ■The blocksize used was 128K, and an average file contained 1.5 blocks. \\nNameNode used about 200 bytes per block and an additional 200 bytes for \\nan i-node. 100 million files referencing 200 million blocks would require \\nRAM capacity exceeding 60 GB.\\n ■For 100 million files with size of 200 million blocks and a replication factor \\nof 3, the disk space required is 60 PB. Thus a rule of thumb was proposed \\nthat 1 GB of RAM in NameNode roughly corresponds to 1 PB of data stor-\\nage based on the assumption of 128K blocksize and 1.5 blocks per file.\\n ■In order to hold 60 PB of data on a 10,000-node cluster, each node needs a \\ncapacity of 6 TB. This can be achieved by having eight 0.75-TB drives.\\n ■The internal workload for the NameNode is block reports. About 3 reports \\nper second containing block information on 60K blocks per report were \\nreceived by the NameNode.\\n ■The external load on the NameNode consisted of external connections and \\ntasks from MapReduce jobs. This resulted in tens of thousands of simultane-ous connections.\\n ■The Client Read consisted of performing a block lookup to get block loca-\\ntions from the NameNode, followed by accessing the nearest replica of the \\nblock. A typical client (the Map job from an MR task) would read data from \\n1,000 files with an average reading of half a file each, amounting to 96 MB of \\ndata. This was estimated to take 1.45 seconds. At that rate, 100,000 clients would send 68,750 block-location requests per second to the NameNode. This was considered to be well within the capacity of the NameNode, which was rated at handling 126K requests per second.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 956}, page_content='926 Chapter 25 Big Data Technologies Based on MapReduce and Hadoop\\n ■The write workload: Given a write throughtput of 40 MB/sec, an average cli-\\nent writes 96 MB in 2.4 sec. That creates over 41K “create block” requests from 100,000 nodes at the NameNode. This was considered far above the NameNode capacity.\\nThe above analysis assumed that there was only one task per node. In reality, there \\ncould be multiple tasks per node as in the real system at Yahoo, which ran 4  MapReduce \\n(MR)tasks per node. The net result was a bottleneck at the NameNode. Issues such as these have been handled in Hadoop v2, which we discuss in the next section.\\n25.3.5 The Hadoop Ecosystem\\nHadoop is best known for the MapReduce programming model, its runtime infrastruc-ture, and the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). However, the Hadoop ecosys-tem has a set of related projects that provide additional functionality on top of these core projects. Many of them are top-level open source Apache projects and have a very large contributing user community of their own. We list a few important ones here:\\nPig and Hive:  These provide a higher level interface for working with the \\nHadoop framework.\\n /box4Pig provides a dataflow language. A script written in PigScript translates \\ninto a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of MapReduce jobs.\\n /box4Hive provides an SQL interface on top of MapReduce. Hive’s SQL support \\nincludes most of the SQL-92 features and many of the advanced analytics \\nfeatures from later SQL standards. Hive also defines the SerDe (Serializa-\\ntion/ Deserialization) abstraction, which defines a way of modeling the \\nrecord structure on datasets in HDFS beyond just key-value pairs. We will discuss both of these in detail in Section 25.4.4.\\nOozie:  This is a service for scheduling and running workflows of Jobs; indi-\\nvidual steps can be MR jobs, Hive queries, Pig scripts, and so on.\\nSqoop:  This is a library and a runtime environment for efficiently moving data \\nbetween relational databases and HDFS.\\nHBase:  This is a column-oriented key-value store that uses HDFS as its under-\\nlying store. (See Chapter 24 for a more detailed discussion of HBase.) It sup-ports both batch processing using MR and key-based lookups. With proper design of the key-value scheme, a variety of applications are implemented using HBase. They include time series analysis, data warehousing, generation of cubes and multi-dimensional lookups, and data streaming.\\n25.4 MapReduce: Additional Details\\nWe introduced the MapReduce paradigm in Section 25.2.2. We now elaborate further \\non it in terms of the MapReduce runtime. We discuss how the relational operation of \\njoin can be handled using MapReduce.

For a detailed description, the reader is encouraged to consult White (2012). MapReduce is a master-slave system that usually runs on the same cluster as HDFS. Typically, medium to large Hadoop clusters consist of a two- or three-level architecture built with rack-mounted servers.\\nJobTracker. The master process is called the JobTracker . It is responsible for man-\\naging the life cycle of Jobs and scheduling Tasks on the cluster. It is responsible for:\\n ■Job submission, initializing a Job, providing Job status and state to both cli-\\nents and TaskTrackers (the slaves), and Job completion.\\n ■Scheduling Map and Reduce tasks on the cluster. It does this using a plug-\\ngable Scheduler.\\nTaskTracker. The slave process is called a TaskTracker . There is one running on \\nall Worker nodes  of the cluster. The Map-Reduce tasks run on Worker nodes. \\nTaskTracker daemons running on these nodes register with the JobTracker on \\nstartup. They run tasks that the JobTracker assigns to them. Tasks are run in a sepa-\\nrate process on the node; the life cycle of the process is managed by the TaskTracker. \\nThe TaskTracker creates the task process, monitors its execution, sends periodic \\nstatus heartbeats to the JobTracker, and under failure conditions can kill the pro-\\ncess at the request of the JobTracker. The TaskTracker provides services to the Tasks, the most important of which is the Shuffle , which we describe in a sub-\\nsection below.\\nA. Overall flow of a MapReduce Job\\nA MapReduce job goes through the processes of Job Submission, Job Initializa-\\ntion, Task Assignment, Task Execution, and finally Job Completion. The Job \\nTracker and Task Tracker we described above are both involved in these. We \\nbriefly review them below.\\nJob submission  A client submits a Job to the JobTracker . The Job package con-\\ntains the executables (as a jar), any other components (files, jars archives) needed to execute the Job, and the InputSplits for the Job.\\nJob initialization  The JobTracker accepts the Job and places it on a Job Queue. \\nBased on the input splits, it creates map tasks for each split. A number of reduce tasks are created based on the Job configuration.\\nTask assignment  The JobTracker’s scheduler assigns Task to the TaskTracker \\nfrom one of the running Jobs. In Hadoop v1, TaskTrackers have a fixed number of slots for map tasks and for reduce tasks. The Scheduler takes the location informa-tion of the input files into account when scheduling tasks on cluster nodes.\\nTask execution  Once a task has been scheduled on a slot, the TaskTracker \\nmanages the execution of the task: making all Task artifacts available to the'),\n",

The TaskTracker also pro-vides the Shuffle Service  to Tasks; we describe this when we discuss the Shuffle \\nProcedure below.\\nJob completion  Once the last Task in a Job is completed, the JobTracker runs \\nthe Job cleanup task (which is used to clean up intermediate files in both HDFS \\nand the local file systems of TaskTrackers).\\nB. Fault Tolerance in MapReduce\\nThere are three kinds of failures: failure of the Task, failure of the TaskTracker, \\nand failure of the JobTracker.\\nTask failure  This can occur if the Task code throws a Runtime exception, or if \\nthe Java Virtual Machine crashes unexpect edly. Another issue is when the Task-\\nTracker does not receive any updates from the Task process for a while (the time period is configurable). In all these cases the TaskTracker notifies the JobTracker that the Task has failed. When the JobTracker is notified of the failure, it will reschedule execution of the task.\\nTaskTracker failure  A TaskTracker process may crash or become disconnected \\nfrom the JobTracker. Once the JobTracker marks a TaskTracker as failed, any map tasks completed by the TaskTracker are put back on the queue to be rescheduled. Similarly, any map task or reduce task in progress on a failed Task-Tracker is also rescheduled.\\nJobTracker failure  In Hadoop v1, JobTracker failure is not a recoverable failure. \\nThe JobTracker is a Single Point of Failure. The JobTracker has to be manually restarted. On restart all the running jobs have to be resubmitted. This is one of the drawbacks of Hadoop v1 that have been addressed by the next generation of Hadoop MapReduce called YARN.\\nSemantics in the presence of failure  When the user-supplied map and reduce \\noperators are deterministic functions of their input values, the MapReduce sys-tem produces the same output as would have been produced by a nonfaulting sequential execution of the entire program. Each task writes its output to a pri-vate task directory. If the JobTracker receives multiple completions for the same Task, it ignores all but the first one. When a Job is completed, Task outputs are moved to the Job output directory.\\nC. The Shuffle Procedure\\nA key feature of the MapReduce (MR) programming model is that the reducers \\nget all the rows for a given key together. This is delivered by what is called the MR shuffle . The shuffle is divided into the Map, Copy, and Reduce phases.\\nMap phase:  When rows are processed in Map tasks, they are initially held in an \\nin-memory buffer, the size of which is configurable (the default is 100 MB). A'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 959}, page_content='25.4 MapReduce: Additional Details  929\\nbackground thread partitions the buffered rows based on the number of Reduc-\\ners in the job and the Partitioner.  The Partitioner  is a pluggable interface that is \\nasked to choose a Reducer for a given Key value and the number of reducers in the Job. The partitioned rows are sorted on their key values. They can further be sorted on a provided Comparator  so that rows with the same key have a stable \\nsort order. This is used for Joins to ensure that for rows with the same key value, rows from the same table are bunched together. Another interface that can be plugged in is the Combiner  interface. This is used to reduce the number of rows \\noutput per key from a mapper and is done by applying a reduce operation on each Mapper for all rows with the same key. During the Map phase, several iterations of partitioning, sorting, and combining may happen. The end result is a single local file per reducer that is sorted on the Key.\\nCopy phase:  The Reducers pull their files from all the Mappers as they become \\navailable. These are provided by the JobTracker in Heartbeat responses. Each Mapper has a set of listener threads that service Reducer requests for these files.\\nReduce phase:  The Reducer reads all its files from the Mappers. All files are \\nmerged before streaming them to the Reduce function. There may be multiple stages of merging, depending on how the Mapper files become available. The Reducer will avoid unnecessary merges; for example, the last N files will be merged as the rows are being streamed to the Reduce function.\\nD. Job Scheduling\\nThe JobTracker  in MR 1.0 is responsible for scheduling work on cluster nodes. \\nClients’ submitted jobs are added to the Job Queue of the JobTracker. The initial versions of Hadoop used a FIFO scheduler that scheduled jobs sequentially as they were submitted. At any given time, the cluster would run the tasks of a single Job. This caused undue delays for short jobs like ad-hoc hive queries if they had to wait for long-running machine learning–type jobs. The wait times would exceed runtimes, and the throughput on the cluster would suffer. Addi-tionally, the cluster also would remain underutilized. We briefly describe two other types of schedulers, called the Fair Scheduler and Capacity Scheduler, that alleviate this situation.\\nFair Scheduler:  The goal of Fair Scheduler is to provide fast response time to \\nsmall jobs in a Hadoop shared cluster. Fo r this scheduler, jobs are grouped into \\nPools. The capacity of the cluster is evenly shared among the Pools. At any given time the resources of the cluster are evenly divided among the Pools, thereby utilizing the capacity of the cluster evenly. A typical way to set up Pools is to assign each user a Pool and assign certain Pools a minimum number of slots.\\nCapacity Scheduler:  The Capacity Scheduler is geared to meet the needs of \\nlarge Enterprise customers. It is designed to allow multiple tenants to share resources of a large Hadoop cluster by allocating resources in a timely manner under a given set of capacity constraints. In large enterprises, individual depart-ments are apprehensive of using one centralized Hadoop cluster for concerns'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 960}, page_content='930 Chapter 25 Big Data Technologies Based on MapReduce and Hadoop\\nthat they may not be able to meet the service-level agreements (SLAs) of their \\napplications. The Capacity Scheduler is designed to give each tenant guarantees \\nabout cluster capacity using the following provisions:\\n /box4There is support for multiple queues, with hard and soft limits in terms of \\nfraction of resources.\\n /box4Access control lists (ACLs) are used that determine who can submit, view, \\nand modify the Jobs in a queue.\\n /box4Excess capacity is evenly distributed among active Queues.\\n /box4Tenants have usage limits; such limits prevent tenants from monopoliz-\\ning the cluster.\\n25.4.2 Example: Achieving Joins in MapReduce\\nTo understand the power and utility of the MapReduce programming model, it is instructive to consider the most important operation of relational algebra, called Join, which we introduced in Chapter 6. We discussed its use via SQL queries (Chapters 7 and 8) and its optimization (Chapters 18 and 19). Let us consider the problem of joining two relations R(A, B)  with S(B, C)  with the join condition  \\nR.A = S.B . Assume both tables reside on HDFS. Here we list the many strategies \\nthat have been devised to do equi-joins in the MapReduce environment.\\nSort-Merge Join. The broadest strategy for performing a join is to utilize the Shuffle \\nto partition and sort the data and have the reducers merge and generate the output. We can set up an MR job that reads blocks from both tables in the Map phase. We set up a Partitioner  to hash partition rows from R and S on the value of the B  column. \\nThe key output from the Map phase includes a table tag. So the key has the form \\n(tag, (key)). In MR, we can configure a custom Sort for the Job’s shuffle; the custom Sort sorts the rows that have the same key. In this case, we Sort rows with the same B value based on the tag. We give the smaller table a tag of 0 and the larger table a tag \\nof 1. So a reducer will see all rows with the same B value in the order: smaller table rows \\nfirst, then larger table rows. The Reducer can buffer smaller table rows; once it starts to receive large table rows, it can do an in-memory cross-product with the buffered small table rows to generate the join output. The cost of this strategy is dominated by the shuffle cost, which will write and read each row multiple times.\\nMap-Side Hash Join. For the case when one of R or S is a small table that can be \\nloaded in the memory of each task, we can have the Map phase operate only on the large table splits. Each Map task can read the entire small table and create an in-memory hash map based on B as the hash key. Then it can perform a hash join. This \\nis similar to Hash Joins in databases. The cost of this task is roughly the cost of read-ing the large table.\\nPartition Join. Assume that both R and S are stored in such a way that they are \\npartitioned on the join keys. Then all rows in each Split belong to a certain identifi-able range of the domain of the join field, which is B in our example. Assume both \\nR and S are stored as p files. Suppose file ( i) contains rows such that (Value B )mod'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 961}, page_content='25.4 MapReduce: Additional Details  931\\np = i. Then we only need to join the ith file of \\\\(R\\\\) R with the corresponding ith file \\nof S. One way to do this is to perform a variation of the Map-Side join we discussed \\nabove: have the Mapper handling the ith partition of the larger table read the ith \\npartition from the smaller table. This strategy can be expanded to work even when the two tables do not have the same number of partitions. It is sufficient for one to be a multiple of the other. For example, if table A is divided into two partitions and table B is divided into four partitions, then partition 1 from table A needs to join with partitions 1 and 3 of B, and partition 2 of A needs to join with partitions 2 and 4 of B. The opportunity to perform Bucketed Join (see below) is also common: for example, assume R and S are outputs of previous sort-merge joins. The output of \\nthe sort-merge join is partitioned in the joining expressions. Further joining this dataset allows us to avoid a shuffle.\\nBucket Joins. This is a combination of Map-Side and Partition Joins. In this case \\nonly one relation, say the right side relation, is Partitioned. We can then run Map-pers on the left side relation and perform a Map Join against each Partition from the right side.\\nN-Way Map-Side Joins. A join on R(A, B, C, D ), S(B, E ), and T(C, F) can be \\nachieved in one MR job provided the rows for a key for all small tables can be buffered in memory. The join is typical in Data Warehouses (see Chapter 29), where R is a fact \\ntable and S and T are dimension tables whose keys are B and C, respectively. Typi-\\ncally, in a Data Warehouse query filters are specified on Dimensional Attributes. Hence each Map task has enough memory to hold the hash map of several small Dimensional tables. As Fact table rows are being read into the Map task, they can be hash joined with all the dimensional tables that the Map task has read into memory.\\nSimple N-Way Joins. A join on R(A, B), S(B, C), and T(B, D) can be achieved in \\none MR job provided the rows for a key for all small tables can be buffered in mem-ory. Suppose R is a large table and S and T are relatively smaller tables. Then it is \\ntypically the case that for any given key value B, the number of rows in S or T will fit \\nin a Task’s memory. Then, by giving the large table the largest tag, it is easy to gen-eralize the Sort-Merge join to an N-way join where the joining expressions are the \\nsame. In a Reducer for a key value of B, the reducer will first receive the S rows, then \\nthe T rows, and finally the R rows. Since the assumption is that there aren’t a large \\nnumber of S and T rows, the reducer can cache them. As it receives R rows, it can do \\na cross product with the cached S and T rows and output the result of join.\\nIn addition to the above strategies for performing joins using the MapReduce para-\\ndigm, algorithms have been proposed for other types joins (e.g., the general multi-way natural join with special cases of chain-join or star-join in data warehouses have been shown to be handled as a single MR job).\\n14 Similarly, algorithms have been \\nproposed to deal with skew in the join attributes (e.g., in a sales fact table, certain \\ndays may have a disproportionate number of transactions). For joins on attributes \\nwith skew, a modified algorithm would let the Partitioner  assign unique values to the \\n14See Afrati and Ullman (2010).'),\n",

There are other factors affecting performance, such as row versus columnar storage and pushing predicates down to storage handlers. These are beyond our scope of discussion here. Inter-ested readers will find ongoing research publications in this area that are similar to Afrati and Ullman (2010).\\nThe purpose of this section is to highlight two major developments that have \\nimpacted the big data community by providing high-level interfaces on top of the \\ncore technology of Hadoop and MapReduce. We will give a brief overview of the language Pig Latin and the system Hive.\\nApache Pig. Pig\\n15 was a system that was designed at Yahoo Research to bridge the \\ngap between declarative-style interfaces such as SQL, which we studied in the con-text of the relational model, and the more rigid low-level procedural-style program-ming style required by MapReduce that we described in Section 25.2.2. Whereas it is possible to express very complex analysis in MR, the user must express programs as a one-input, two-stage (map and reduce) process. Furthermore, MR provides no methods for describing a complex data flow that applies a sequence of transforma-tions on the input. There is no standard way to do common data transformation operations like Projections, Filtering, Grouping, and Joining. We saw all these operations being expressed declaratively in SQL in Chapters 7 and 8. However, there is a community of users and programmers that thinks more procedurally. So the developers of Pig invented the language Pig Latin to fill in the “sweet spot” between SQL and MR. We show an example of a simple Group By query expressed in Pig Latin in Olston et al. (2008):\\nThere is a table of urls: (url,category.pagerank).\\nWe wish to find, for categories having a large number of URLs, the average page-\\nrank of the high-pagerank URLs in that category. This requires a grouping of URLs by category. The SQL query that expresses this requirement may look like:\\nSELECT category, AVG(pagerank)\\nFROM urls WHERE pagerank > 0.2\\nGROUP BY category HAVING COUNT( *) > 10 **6\\nThe same query in Pig Latin is written as:\\ngood_urls = FILTER urls BY pagerank > 0.2;\\ngroups = GROUP good_urls BY category;big_groups = FILTER groups BY COUNT(good_urls)> 10 **6;\\noutput =  FOREACH big_groups GENERATE \\ncategory, AVG(good_urls.pagerank);\\n15See Olston et al. (2008).'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 963}, page_content='25.4 MapReduce: Additional Details  933\\nAs shown by this example, a Pigscript written using the scripting language Pig Latin \\nis a sequence of data transformation steps. On each step, a basic transformation like Filter, Group By, or Projection is expressed. The script resembles a query plan for the SQL query similar to the plans we discussed in Chapter 19. The language sup-ports operating on nested data structures like JSON (Java Script Object Notation) and XML. It has an extensive and extendible function library, and also an ability to bind schema to data very late or not at all.\\nPig was designed to solve problems such as ad hoc analyses of Web logs and click-\\nstreams. The logs and clickstreams typically require custom processing at row level as well as at an aggregate level. Pig accommodates user-defined functions (UDFs) extensively. It also supports a nested data model with the following four types:\\nAtoms:  Simple atomic values such as a number or a string\\nTuples:  A sequence of fields, each of which can be of any permissible type\\nBag:  A collection of tuples with possible duplicates\\nMap:  A collection of data items where each item has a key that allows direct \\naccess to it\\nOlston et al. (2008) demonstrates interesting applications on logs using Pig. An \\nexample is analysis of activity logs for a search engine over any time period (day, week, month, etc.) to calculate frequency of search terms by a user’s geographic loca-tion. Here the functions needed include mapping IP addresses to geo-locations and using n-gram extraction. Another application involves co-grouping search queries \\nof one period with those of another period in the past based on search terms.\\nPig was architected so that it could run on different execution environments. In \\nimplementing Pig, Pig Latin was compiled into physical plans that were translated into a series of MR jobs and run in Hadoop. Pig has been a useful tool for enhanc-ing programmers’ productivity in the Hadoop environment.\\n25.4.3 Apache Hive\\nHive was developed at Facebook16 with a similar intent—to provide a higher level \\ninterface to Hadoop using SQL-like queries and to support the processing of aggre-gate analytical queries that are typical in data warehouses (see Chapter 29). Hive remains a primary interface for accessing data in Hadoop at Facebook; it has been adopted widely in the open source community and is undergoing continuous improvements. Hive went beyond Pig Latin in that it provided not only a high-level language interface to Hadoop, but a layer that makes Hadoop look like a DBMS with DDL, metadata repository, JDBC/ODBC access, and an SQL compiler. The architecture and components of Hive are shown in Figure 25.2.\\nFigure 25.2 shows Apache Thrift as interface in Hive. Apache Thrift defines an \\nInterface Definition Language (IDL) and Communication Protocol used to develop \\n16See Thusoo et al. (2010).'),\n",

It comes with a runtime and code generation engine that can be \\nused to develop remote services in many languages, including Java, C++, Python, and Ruby. Apache Thrift supports JSON-based and binary protocols; it supports http, socket, and file transports.\\nThe Hive query language HiveQL includes a subset of SQL that includes all types of \\njoins, Group By operations, as well as useful functions related to primitive and com-plex data types. We comment below on some of the highlights of the Hive system.\\nInterfacing with HDFS: \\n ■Tables in Hive are linked to directories in HDFS. Users can define parti-\\ntions within tables. For example, a Web log table can be partitioned by day \\nand within day by the hour. Each partition level introduces a level of direc-\\ntories in HDFS. A table may also be stored as bucketed  on a set of columns. \\nThis means that the stored data is physically partitioned by the column(s). For example, within an hour directory, the data may be bucketed  by  Userid; \\nthis means that each hour’s data is stored in a set of files, each file rep-resents a bucket of Users, and the bucket is based on the hashing of the Userid column. Users can specify how many buckets the data should be divided into.\\n ■The SerDe (Serialization/Deserialization) plugin architecture lets users \\nspecify how data in native file formats is exposed as rows to Hive SQL oper-ators. Hive comes with a rich set of SerDe functions and supported File formats (e.g., CSV, JSON, SequenceFile); columnar formats (e.g., RCFile, ORCFile, Parquet); and support for Avro—another data serialization sys-tem. The different StorageHandlers  expand on the SerDe mechanism to \\nallow pluggable behavior for how data is read/written and the ability to push predicates  down to the Storage Handler for early evaluation.

Early on, there was support for logical optimizations such as pruning unneeded columns and pushing selection predicates down into the query tree. Physical optimizations of converting sort-merge joins to Map-side joins based on user hints and data file sizes have also been incorporated. Hive started with support for a subset of SQL-92 that included SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, and filters based on conditions in the WHERE clause. Hive users can express complex SQL commands in Hive. Early in its development, Hive was able to run the 22 TPCH benchmark queries (Transaction Processing Performance Council benchmark for decision support), although with considerable manual rewriting.\\nSignificant strides have been made in language support and in optimizer and run-\\ntime techniques. Here is a sampling of those improvements:\\n ■Hive SQL has added many analytic features of SQL, such as subquery predicates, \\nCommon Table expressions (this is the WITH clause in SQL that allows users to \\nname common subquery blocks and reference them multiple times in the query; \\nthese expressions can be considered query-level views), aggregates over a certain \\nwindow within the data, Rollups (which refer to higher aggregation levels), and Grouping sets (this capability allows you to express multiple levels of aggrega-tion in one Group By level). Consider, for example, Group By Grouping Sets \\n((year, month), (dayofweek)); this expresses aggregates both at the (Year, \\nMonth) level and also by DayOfWeek. A full set of SQL data types, including \\nvarchars, numeric types, and dates, is now supported. Hive also supports the \\ncommon Change Data Capture ETL flow via Insert and Update statements. In a Data Warehouse, the process of delivering slowly changing Dimensions (e.g., customers in a Retail Data Warehouse) requires a complex dataflow of identi-fying new and updated records in that Dimension. This is called the Change Data Capture (CDC) process. By adding Insert and Update statements in Hive, it is possible to model and execute CDC processes in Hive SQL.\\n ■Hive now has a greatly expanded set of DDLs for expressing grants and priv-\\nileges in terms of discretionary access control (see Section 30.2).\\n ■Several standard database optimizations have been incorporated, including \\nPartition pruning, Join reordering, Index rewrite, and Reducing the number \\nof MR jobs. Very large tables, like Fact tables in Data Warehouses, are typi-\\ncally partitioned. Time is probably the most common attribute used for parti-\\ntioning. With HDFS being used as the storage layer, users tend to retain data for long time periods. But a typical Warehouse will only include the most cur-rent time periods (e.g., the last quarter or current year). The time periods are specified as filters in the Query. Partition Pruning is the technique of extracting relevant predicates from the Query filters and translating them to a list of'),\n",

Obviously, this has a huge impact on \\nperformance and cluster utilization: Instead of scanning all partitions retained for the last N years, only the partitions from the last few weeks/months are \\nscanned. Work in progress includes collecting column- and table-level statis-tics and generating plans based on a cost model that uses these statistics (simi-lar to what we considered for RDBMSs in Chapter 19).\\n ■Hive now supports Tez as a runtime environment that has significant advan-\\ntages over MR, including that there is no need to write to disk between jobs; and there is no restriction on one-input, two-stage processes. There is also active work to support Hive on Spark, a new technology that we briefly mention in Section 25.6.\\n25.4.4 Advantages of the Hadoop/MapReduce Technology\\nHadoop version 1 was optimized for batch processing on very large datasets. Vari-ous factors contribute to its success:\\n  1. The disk seek rate is a limiting factor when we deal with petabyte-level work-loads. Seek is limited by the disk mechanical structure, whereas the transfer speed is an electronic feature and increasing steadily. (See Section 16.2 for a discussion of disk drives.) The MapReduce model of scanning datasets in parallel alleviates this situation. For instance, scanning a 100-TB dataset sequentially using 1 machine at a rate of 50 Mbps will take about 24 days to complete. On the other hand, scanning the same data using 1,000 machines in parallel will just take 35 minutes. Hadoop recommends very large block sizes, 64 MB or higher. So when scanning datasets, the percentage of time spent on disk seeks is negligible. Unlimited disk seek rates combined with processing large datasets in chunks and in parallel is what drives the scal-ability and speed of the MapReduce model.\\n  2. The MapReduce model allows handling of semistructured data and key-value datasets more easily compared to traditional RDBMSs, which require a predefined schema. Files such as very large logfiles present a particular problem in RDBMSs because they need to be parsed in multiple ways before they can be analyzed.\\n  3. The MapReduce model has linear scalability in that resources can be added to improve job latency and throughput in a linear fashion. The failure model is simple, and individual failed jobs can be rerun without a major impact on the whole job.\\n25.5 Hadoop v2 alias YAR N\\nIn previous sections, we discussed Hadoop development in detail. Our discussion \\nincluded the core concepts of the MapReduce paradigm for programming and the \\nHDFS underlying storage infrastructure. We also discussed high-level interfaces \\nlike Pig and Hive that are making it possible to do SQL-like, high level data process-\\ning on top of the Hadoop framework. Now we turn our attention to subsequent \\ndevelopments, which are broadly called Hadoop v2 or MRv2 or YARN (Yet Another'),\n",

First, we point out the shortcomings of the Hadoop v1 plat-\\nform and the rationale behind YARN.\\n25.5.1 Rationale behind YARN\\nDespite the success of Hadoop v1, user experience with Hadoop v1 in enterprise applications highlighted some shortcomings and suggested that an upgrade of Hadoop v1 might be necessary:\\n ■As cluster sizes and the number of users grew, the JobTracker became a bot-\\ntleneck. It was always known to be the Single Point of Failure.\\n ■With a static allocation of resources to map and reduce functions, utilization \\nof the cluster of nodes was less than desirable\\n ■HDFS was regarded as a single storage system for data in the enterprise. \\nUsers wanted to run different types of applications that would not easily fit into the MR model. Users tended to get around this limitation by running Map-only Jobs, but this only compounded scheduling and utilization issues.\\n ■On large clusters, it became problematic to keep up with new open source \\nversions of Hadoop, which were released every few months.\\nThe above reasons explain the rationale for developing version 2 of Hadoop. Some \\nof the points mentioned in the previous list warrant a more detailed discussion, which we provide next.\\nMultitenancy: Multitenancy refers to accommodating multiple tenants/users con-\\ncurrently so that they can share resources. As the cluster sizes grew and the number of users increased, several communities of users shared the Hadoop cluster. At Yahoo, the original solution to this problem was Hadoop on Demand , which was \\nbased on the Torque resource manager and Maui scheduler. Users could set up a separate cluster for each Job or set of Jobs. This had several advantages:\\n ■Each cluster could run its own version of Hadoop.\\n ■JobTracker failures were isolated to a single cluster.\\n ■Each user/organization could make independent decisions on the size and \\nconfiguration of its cluster depending on expected workloads.\\nBut Yahoo abandoned Hadoop on Demand for the following reasons:\\n ■Resource allocation was not based on data locality. So most reads and writes \\nfrom HDFS were remote accesses, which negated one of the key benefits of \\nthe MR model of mostly local data accesses.\\n ■The allocation of a cluster was static. This meant large parts of a cluster were \\nmostly idle:\\n /box4Within an MR job, the reduce slots were not usable during the Map phase \\nand the map slots were not usable during the Reduce phase. When using \\nhigher level languages like Pig and Hive, each script or query spawned \\nmultiple Jobs. Since cluster allocation was static, the maximum nodes \\nneeded in any Job had to be acquired upfront.'),\n",

Users started extending the lifetime of clusters and holding the clusters longer than they needed. This affected cluster utilization negatively.\\nJobTracker Scalability. As the cluster sizes increased beyond 4,000 nodes, issues \\nwith memory management and locking made it difficult to enhance JobTracker to handle the workload. Multiple options were considered, such as holding data about Jobs in memory, limiting the number of tasks per Job, limiting the number of Jobs submitted per user, and limiting the number of concurrently running jobs. None of these seemed to fully satisfy all users; JobTracker often ran out of memory.\\nA related issue concerned completed Jobs. Completed jobs were held in JobTracker \\nand took up memory. Many schemes attempted to reduce the number and memory footprint of completed Jobs. Eventually, a viable solution was to offload this func-tion to a separate Job History daemon.\\nAs the number of TaskTrackers grew, the latencies for heartbeats (signals from \\nTaskTracker to JobTracker) were almost 200 ms. This meant that heartbeat intervals for TaskTrackers could be 40 seconds or more when there were more than 200 task trackers in the cluster. Efforts were made to fix this but were eventually abandoned.\\nJobTracker: Single Point of Failure. The recovery model of Hadoop v1 was \\nvery weak. A failure of JobTracker would bring down the entire cluster. In this event, the state of running Jobs was lost, and all jobs would have to be resubmitted and JobTracker restarted. Efforts to make the information about completed jobs persist did not succeed. A related issue was to deploy new versions of the software. This required scheduling a cluster downtime, which resulted in backlogs of jobs and a subsequent strain on JobTracker upon restart.\\nMisuse of the MapReduce Programming Model. MR runtime was not a great \\nfit for iterative processing; this was particularly true for machine learning algo-rithms in analytical workloads. Each iteration is treated as an MR job. Graph algo-rithms are better expressed using a bulk synchronous parallel (BSP) model, which uses message passing as opposed to the Map and Reduce primitives. Users got around these impediments by inefficient alternatives such as implementing machine learning algorithms as long-running Map-only jobs. These types of jobs initially read data from HDFS and executed the first pass in parallel; but then exchanged data with each other outside the control of the framework. Also, the fault tolerance was lost. The JobTracker was not aware of how these jobs operated; this lack of awareness led to poor utilization and instability in the cluster.\\nResource Model Issues. In Hadoop v1, a node is divided into a fixed number of \\nMap and Reduce slots. This led to cluster underutilization because idle slots could'),\n",

Jobs other than MR could not run easily on the nodes because the node \\ncapacity remained unpredictable.\\nThe aforementioned issues illustrate why Hadoop v1 needed upgrading. \\nAlthough attempts were made to fix in Hadoop v1 many of the issues listed above, it became clear that a redesign was needed. The goals of the new design were set as follows:\\n ■To carry forward the scalibility and locality awareness of Hadoop v1.\\n ■To have multitenancy and high cluster utilization.\\n ■To have no single point of failure and to be highly available.\\n ■To support more than just MapReduce jobs. The cluster resources should \\nnot be modeled as static map and reduce slots.\\n ■To be backward compatible, so existing jobs should run as they are and pos-\\nsibly without any recompilation.\\nThe outcome of these was YARN or Hadoop v2, which we discuss in the next section.\\n25.5.2 YARN Architecture\\nOverview. Having provided the motivation behind upgrading Hadoop v1, we \\nnow discuss the detailed architecture of the next generation of Hadoop, which is \\npopularly known as MRv2, MapReduce 2.0, Hadoop v2, or YARN.17 The central \\nidea of YARN is the separation of cluster Resource Management from Jobs man-agement. Additionally, YARN introduces the notion of an ApplicationMaster , \\nwhich is now responsible for managing work (task data flows, task lifecycles, task failover, etc.). MapReduce is now available as a service/application provided by the MapReduce ApplicationMaster . The implications of these two decisions \\nare far-reaching and are central to the notion of a data service operating system. Figure 25.3 shows a high-level schematic diagram of Hadoop v1 and Hadoop v2 side by side.\\nThe ResourceManager  and the per worker node NodeManager  together form the \\nplatform on which any Application can be hosted on YARN. The Resource Manager \\nmanages the cluster, doling out Resources based on a pluggable scheduling policy \\n(such as a fairness policy or optimizing cluster utilization policy). It is also respon-\\nsible for the lifecycle of nodes in the cluster in that it will track when nodes go down, when nodes become unreachable, or when new nodes join. Node failures are reported to the ApplicationMasters that had containers on the failed node. New nodes become available for use by ApplicationMasters.\\nApplicationMasters send ResourceRequests to the ResourceManager which then \\nresponds with cluster Container leases. A Container  is a lease by the Resource-\\nManager to the ApplicationManager to use certain amount of resources on a node \\n17See the Apache website: http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/\\nYARN.html for up-to-date documentation on YARN.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 970}, page_content='940 Chapter 25 Big Data Technologies Based on MapReduce and Hadoop\\nof the cluster. The ApplicationMaster presents a Container Launch Context to the \\nNodeManager for the node that this lease references. The Launch Context, in addition to containing the lease, also specifies how to run the process for the task and how to get any resources like jars, libs for the process, environment variables, and security tokens. A node has a certain processing power in terms of number of cores, memory, network bandwidth, etc. Currently, YARN only considers mem-ory. Based on its processing power, a node can be divided into an interchangeable set of containers. Once an ApplicationMaster receives a container lease, it is free to schedule work on it as it pleases. ApplicationMasters, based on their workload, can continuously change their Resource requirements. The ResourceManager bases its scheduling decisions purely on these requests, on the state of the cluster, and on the cluster’s scheduling policy. It is not aware of the actual tasks being carried out on the nodes. The responsibility of managing and analyzing the actual work is left to ApplicationMasters.\\nThe NodeManager  is responsible for managing Containers on their nodes. Con-\\ntainers are responsible for reporting on the node health. They also handle the pro-cedure for nodes joining the cluster. Containers provide the Container Launch service to ApplicationMasters. Other services available include a Local cache, which could be User level, Application level, or Container level. Containers also can be configured to provide other services to Tasks running on them. For example, for MR tasks, the shuffle is now provided as a Node-level service.\\nThe ApplicationMaster  is now responsible for running jobs on the cluster. Based on \\ntheir job(s) the clusters negotiate for Resources with the ResourceManager. The \\nApplicationMaster  itself runs on the cluster; at startup time a client submits an \\nApplication to the ResourceManager, which then allocates a container for the ApplicationMaster and launches it in that container. In the case of MR, the  ApplicationMaster takes over most of the tasks of the JobTracker: it launches Map and Reduce tasks, makes decisions on their placement, manages failover of tasks, maintains counters similar to Job state counters, and provides a monitoring inter-face for running Jobs. The management and interface for completed jobs has been moved to a separate Job History Server.Hadoop  v1\\nHDFSMap Reduce\\nCluster\\nResource Management\\n+\\nJob ManagementPig HiveHadoop  v2\\nHDFSMap Reduce\\nApplication Mstr\\nYAR N\\nRESOURCE MANA GEMENTTez\\nApplication MstrPig Hive\\nFigure 25.3 \\nThe Hadoop v1 vs. Hadoop v2  schematic.'),\n",

Each of \\nthese can expose its own programming model.\\n ■Application Masters are free to negotiate resources in patterns that are opti-\\nmized for their work: for example, machine learning Apps may hold Con-tainers for long durations.\\n ■The Resource and Container model allows nodes to be utilized in a dynamic \\nmanner, which increases the overall utilization of the cluster.\\n ■The ResourceManager does only one thing—manage resources; hence it is \\nhighly scalable to tens of thousands of nodes.\\n ■With ApplicationMasters managing Jobs, it is possible to have multiple ver-\\nsions of an Application running on the cluster. There is no need for a global cluster update, which would require that all Jobs be stopped.\\nFailure of an ApplicationMaster affects only Jobs managed by it. The Resource-\\nManager provides some degree of management of ApplicationMasters. Let us \\nbriefly consider each of the components of the YARN environment.\\nResource Manager (RM). The Resource Manager is only concerned with allo-\\ncating resources to Applications, and not with optimizing the processing within \\nApplications. The policy of resource allocation is pluggable. Application Masters \\nare supposed to request resources that would optimize their workload.\\nThe Resource Manager exposes the following interfaces:\\n  1. An API for clients to start ApplicationMasters\\n  2. A protocol for ApplicationMasters to negotiate for cluster resources\\n  3. A protocol for NodeManagers to report on node resources and be managed \\nby the Resource Manager\\nThe scheduler in the ResourceManager matches the Resource Requirements sub-\\nmitted by Applications against the global state of the cluster resources. The alloca-tion is based on the policies of the pluggable Scheduler (such as capacity or fairness). Resources are requested by ApplicationMasters as Resource Requests . A Resource \\nRequest specifies:\\n ■The number of containers needed\\n ■The physical resources (CPU, memory) needed per container\\n ■The locality preferences (physical node, rack) of the containers\\n ■The priority of the request for the Application\\nThe scheduler satisfies these requests based on the state of the cluster as reported by \\nthe NodeManager heartbeats. The locality and priority guides the scheduler toward alternatives: for example, if a requested node is busy, the next best alternative is another node on the same rack.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 972}, page_content='942 Chapter 25 Big Data Technologies Based on MapReduce and Hadoop\\nThe scheduler also has the ability to request resources back from an Application if \\nneeded and can even take back the resources forcibly. Applications, in returning a container, can migrate the work to another container, or checkpoint the state and restore it on another container. It is important to point out what the Resource man-ager is not responsible for: handling the execution of tasks within an application, \\nproviding any status information about applications, providing history of finished jobs, and providing any recovery for failed tasks.\\nApplicationMaster (AM). The ApplicationMaster is responsible for coordinating \\nthe execution of an Application on the cluster. An Application can be a set of pro-cesses like an MR Job, or it can be a long-running service like a Hadoop on demand (HOD) cluster serving multiple MR jobs. This is left to the Application Writer.\\nThe ApplicationMaster will periodically notify the ResourceManager of its current \\nResource Requirements through a heartbeat mechanism. Resources are handed to the ApplicationMaster as Container leases. Resources used by an Application are dynamic: they are based on the progress of the application and the state of the clus-ter. Consider an example: the MR ApplicationMaster running an MR job will ask for a container on each of the m nodes where an InputSplit resides. If it gets a con-\\ntainer on one of the nodes, the ApplicationMaster will either remove the request for containers on the rest of the m-1 nodes or at least reduce their priority. On the \\nother hand, if the map task fails, it is AM that tracks this failure and requests con-tainers on other nodes that have a replica of the same InputSplit.\\nNodeManager. A NodeManager runs on every worker node of the cluster. It \\n manages Containers and provides pluggable services for Containers. Based on a detailed Container Launch Context  specification, a NodeManager can launch a pro-\\ncess on its node with the environment and local directories set up. It also monitors to make sure the resource utilization does not exceed specifications. It also periodically reports on the state of the Containers and the node health. A NodeManager provides local services to all Containers running on it. The Log Aggregation  service is used to \\nupload each task’s standard output and standard error (stdout and stderr) to HDFS. A NodeManager may be configured to run a set of pluggable auxillary services . For \\nexample, the MR Shuffle is provided as a NodeManager service. A Container run-ning a Map task produces the Map output and writes to local disk.The output is made available to Reducers of the Job via the Shuffle service running on the Node.\\nFault tolerance and availability. The RM remains the single point of failure in \\nYARN. On restart, the RM can recover its state from a persistent store. It kills all containers in the cluster and restarts each ApplicationMaster. There is currently a push to provide an active/passive mode for RMs. The failure of an Application-Master is not a catastrophic event; it only affects one Application. It is responsible for recovering the state of its Application. For example, the MR ApplicationMaster \\nwill recover its completed task and rerun any running tasks.\\nFailure of a Container because of issues with the Node or because of Application \\ncode is tracked by the framework and reported to the ApplicationMaster. It is the \\nresponsibility of the ApplicationMaster to recover from the failure.'),\n",

Here we list some of the Frameworks that have become available in YARN at the time this text was written.\\nApache Tez. Tez is an extensible framework being developed at Hortonworks for \\nbuilding high-performance applications in YARN; these applications will handle large datasets up to petabytes. Tez allows users to express their workflow as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of tasks. Jobs are modeled as DAGs, where Vertices are tasks or operations and Edges represent interoperation dependencies or flows of data. Tez supports the standard dataflow patterns like pipeline, scatter-gather, and broadcast. Users can specify the concurrency in a DAG, as well as the failover characteristics, such as whether to store task output in persistent storage or to recompute it. The DAG can be changed at runtime based on job and cluster state. The DAG model is a more natural fit (than executing as one or more MapReduce jobs) for Pig scripts and SQL physical plans. Both Hive and Pig now provide a mode in which they run on Tez. Both have benefitted in terms of simpler plans and sig-nificant performance improvements. An often cited performance optimization is the Map-Reduce-Reduce pattern; an SQL query that has a Join followed by a Group-By normally is translated to two MR jobs: one for the Join and one for the Group-By. In the first MR stage, the output of the join will be written to HDFS and read back in the Map phase of the second MR for the Group-By Job. In Tez, this extra write and read to/from HDFS can be avoided by having the Join Vertex of the DAG stream resulting rows to the Group-By Vertex.\\nApache Giraph. Apache Giraph is the open source implementation of Google’s \\nPregel system,\\n18 which was a large-scale graph processing system used to calculate \\nPage-Rank. (See Section 27.7.3 for a definition of Page-Rank.) Pregel was based on the bulk synchronous processing (BSP) model of computation.\\n19 Giraph added sev-\\neral features to Pregel, including sharded aggregators (sharding, as defined in Chapter 24, refers to a form of partitioning) and edge-oriented input. The Hadoop v1 version of Giraph ran as MR jobs, which was not a very good fit. It did this by running long-running Map-only Jobs. On YARN, the Giraph implementation exposes an iterative processing model. Giraph is currently used at Facebook to ana-\\nlyze the social network users’ graph, which has users as nodes and their connections \\nas edges; the current number of users is approximately 1.3 billion.\\nHoya: HBase on YARN. The Hortonworks Hoya (HBase on YARN) project pro-\\nvides for elastic HBase clusters running on YARN with the goal of more flexibility \\nand improved utilization of the cluster. We discussed HBase in Section 24.5 as a \\n18Pregel is described in Malewicz et al. (2010).\\n19BSP is a model for designing parallel algorithms and was originally proposed by Valiant (1990).'),\n",

HBase is patterned after BigTable from Google20 but is \\nimplemented using Hadoop and HDFS. Hoya is being developed to address the need for creating on-demand clusters of HBase, with possibly different versions of HBase running on the same cluster. Each of the HBase instances can be individually config-ured. The Hoya ApplicationMaster launches the HBase Master locally. The Hoya AM also asks the YARN RM for a set of containers to launch HBase RegionServers on the cluster. HBase RegionServers are the worker processes of Hbase; each ColumnFamily (which is like a set of Columns in a relational table) is distributed across a set of RegionServers. This can be used to start one or more HBase instances on the cluster, on demand. The clusters are elastic and can grow or shrink based on demand.\\nThe above three examples of the applications developed on YARN should give \\nthe\\xa0reader a sense of the possibilities that have been opened up by the decoupling of\\xa0 Resource Management from Application Management in the overall  Hadoop/MapReduce architecture by YARN.\\n25.6 General Discussion\\nSo far, we have discussed the big data technology development that has occurred roughly in the 2004–2014 time frame, and we have emphasized Hadoop v1 and YARN (also referred to as Hadoop v2 or MRv2). In this section, we must first state the following disclaimer: there are a number of ongoing projects under Apache open source banner as well as in companies devoted to developing products in this area (e.g., Hortonworks, Cloudera, MapR) as well as many private startup companies. Similarly, the Amplab at University of California and other academic institutions are contributing heavily to developing technology that we have not been able to cover in detail. There is also a series of issues associated with the cloud concept, with running MapReduce in the cloud environment, and with data warehousing in the cloud that we have not discussed. Given this background, we now cover a few general topics that are worth mentioning in the context of the elaborate descriptions we presented so far in this chapter. We present issues related to the tussle between the traditional approach to high performance applications in parallel RDBMS implementations vis-à-vis Hadoop- and YARN-based technologies. Then we present a few points related to how big data and cloud technologies will be complementary in nature. We outline issues related to the locality of data and the optimization issues inherent in the stor-age clouds and the compute clouds. We also discuss YARN as a data services plat-\\nform and the ongoing movement to harness big data for analytics. Finally, we present \\nsome current challenges facing the entire big data movement.\\n25.6.1 Hadoop/MapReduce vs. Parallel RDBMS\\nA team of data experts, including Abadi, DeWitt, Madden, and Stonebracker, have done a methodological study comparing a couple of parallel database systems with \\n20BigTable is described in Chang et al. (2006).'),\n",

(2009)). \\nThese experts measure the performance of these two approaches on the same benchmark using a 100-node cluster. They admit that the parallel database took longer to load and tune compared to MR, but the performance of parallel DBMSs was “strikingly better.” We list the areas the experts compared in the study and attempt to show the progress made in both DBMSs and Hadoop since then.\\nPerformance. In their paper, Pavlo et al. concluded that parallel DBMSs were \\nthree to six times faster than MR. The paper lists many reasons why the DBMSs \\ngave better performance. Among the reasons given are the following: (i) indexing \\nwith B\\n+-trees, which expedites selection and filtering; (ii) novel storage orientation \\n(e.g., column-based storage has certain advantages); (iii) techniques that allow operations on compressed data directly; and (iv) parallel query optimization tech-niques common in parallel DBMSs.\\nSince the time of Pavlo et al.’s comparison, which involved Hadoop version 0.19, \\nhuge strides have been made in the MR runtime, the storage formats, and the plan-ning capabilities for job scheduling and for optimizing complex data flows in the Hadoop ecosystem. ORC  and Parquet  file formats are sophisticated Columnar file \\nformats that have the same aggressive compression techniques, the ability to push predicates to the storage layer, and the ability to answer aggregate queries without scanning data. We will briefly talk about the improvements in HDFS and MR; Apache Hive has made huge strides in both the runtime and Cost-based optimiza-tions of complex SQLs. In their move to transform Hadoop from batch into real-time and interactive query mode, Hortonworks (2014) reports orders-of-magnitude gains in performance of queries on a TPC-DS (decision support )–style bench-mark. Cloudera’s Impala product, as reported in Cloudera (2014), uses Parquet (the open source columnar data format) and is claimed to perform comparably to \\ntraditional RDBMSs.\\nUpfront Cost advantage. Hadoop has maintained its cost advantage. With few \\nexceptions, Hadoop continues to be primarily an open source platform. YARN, Hive, and Spark are all developed as Apache projects and are available as freely downloadable packages.\\nHandling Unstructured/Semistructured data. MR reads data by applying the \\nschema definition to it; doing so allows it to handle semistructured datasets like CSVS, JSON, and XML documents. The loading process is relatively inexpensive for the Hadoop/MR systems. However, the support for unstructured data is defi-nitely on the rise in RDBMSs. PostgreSQL now supports key-value stores and json; most RDBMSs have a support for XML. On the other hand, one of the reasons for \\nthe performance gains on the Hadoop side has been the use of specialized data for-\\nmats like ORC (Optimized Row Columnar) and Parquet (another open source \\ncolumnar format). The latter may not remain a strongly differentiating feature among RDBMSs and Hadoop-based systems for too long because RDBMSs may also incorporate special data formats.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 976}, page_content='946 Chapter 25 Big Data Technologies Based on MapReduce and Hadoop\\nHigher level language support. SQL was a distinguishing feature that was in \\nfavor for RDBMSs for writing complex analytical queries. However, Hive has incorporated a large number of SQL features in HiveQL, including grouping and aggregation as well as nested subqueries and multiple functions that are useful in data warehouses, as we discussed previously. Hive 0.13 is able to execute about 50 queries from the TPC-DS benchmark without any manual rewriting. New machine learning–oriented function libraries are emerging (e.g., the function library at madlib.net supports traditional RDBMSs like PostgreSql as well as the Pivotal dis-tribution of Hadoop database (PHD)). Pivotal’s HAWQ claims to be the latest and most powerful parallel SQL engine combining the advantages of SQL and Hadoop. Furthermore, the YARN plugin architecture that we discussed simplifies the pro-cess of extending the fabric with new components and new functions. Pig and Hive have extendibility with UDFs (user-defined functions). Several data services are now available on YARN, such as Revolution R and Apache Mahout for machine learning and Giraph for graph processing. Many traditional DBMSs now run on the YARN platform; for example, the Vortex analytic platform from Actian\\n21 and \\nBigSQL 3.0 from IBM.22\\nFault tolerance. Fault tolerance remains a decided advantage of MR-based sys-\\ntems. The panel of authors in Pavlo et al. (2009) also acknowledged that “MR does a superior job of minimizing the amount of work lost when a hardware failure occurs.” As pointed out by these authors, this capability comes at the cost of mate-rializing intermediate files between Map and Reduce phases. But as Hadoop begins to handle very complex data flows (such as in Apache Tez) and as the need for latencies decreases, users can trade off performance for fault tolerance. For exam-ple, in Apache Spark one can configure an intermediate Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD)\\n23 to be either materialized on disk or in memory, or even to be \\nrecomputed from its input.\\nAs we can see from this discussion, even though MR started with a goal of sup-\\nporting batch-oriented workloads, it could not keep up with traditional parallel RDBMSs in terms of interactive query workloads, as exemplified by Pavlo et al. (2009). However, the two camps have moved much closer to each other in capa-bilities. Market forces, such as the need for venture capital for new startups, require an SQL engine for new applications that largely deal with very large semistruc-tured datasets; and the research community’s interest and involvement have brought about substantial improvements in Hadoop’s capability to handle tradi-tional analytical workloads. But there is still significant catching up to be done in all the areas pointed out in Pavlo et al. (2009): runtime, planning and optimiza-tion, and analytic feature-sets.\\n21See http://www.actian.com/about-us/blog/sql-hadoop-real-deal/ for a current description.\\n22See Presentation at http://www.slideshare.net/Hadoop_Summit/w-325p230-azubirigrayatv4 for a \\ncurrent description.\\n23See Zaharia et al.

It is not possible to address the details of cloud computing issues in the present context. However, we state some compelling reasons why big data technology is in some sense dependent on cloud technology not only for its further expansion, but for its continued existence.\\n ■The cloud model affords a high degree of flexibility in terms of management \\nof resources: “scaling out,” which refers to adding more nodes or resources; \\n“scaling up,” which refers to adding more resources to a node in the system; \\nor even downgrading are easily handled almost instantaneously.\\n ■The resources are interchangeable; this fact, coupled with the design of dis-\\ntributed software, creates a good ecosystem where failure can be absorbed easily and where virtual computing instances can be left unperturbed. For the cost of a few hundred dollars, it is possible to perform data mining oper-ations that involve complete scans of terabyte databases, and to crawl huge Web sites that contain millions of pages.\\n ■It is not uncommon for big data projects to exhibit unpredictable or peak \\ncomputing power and storage needs. These projects are faced with the chal-lenge of providing for this peak demand on an as-needed and not necessar-ily continuous basis. At the same time, business stakeholders expect swift, inexpensive, and dependable products and project outcomes. To meet with these conflicting requirements, cloud services offer an ideal solution.\\n ■A common situation in which cloud services and big data go hand-in-hand \\nis as follows: Data is transferred to or collected in a cloud data storage sys-tem, like Amazon’s S3, for the purpose of collecting log files or exporting text-formatted data. Alternatively, database adapters can be utilized to access data from databases in the cloud. Data processing frameworks like Pig, Hive, and MapReduce, which we described above in Section 25.4, are used to analyze raw data (which may have originated in the cloud).\\n ■Big data projects and startup companies benefit a great deal from using a \\ncloud storage service. They can trade capital expenditure for operational expenditure; this is an excellent trade because it requires no capital outlay or risk. Cloud storage provides reliable and scalable storage solutions of a qual-ity otherwise unachievable.\\n ■Cloud services and resources are globally distributed. They ensure high avail-\\nability and durability unattainable by most but the largest organizations.\\nThe Netflix Case for Marrying Cloud and Big Data.24 Netflix is a large orga-\\nnization characterized by a very profitable business model and an extremely inex-pensive and reliable service for consumers.

Netflix uses Amazon S3 rather than HDFS as the data \\nprocessing and analysis platform for several reasons. Netflix presently uses Ama-zon’s Elastic MapReduce (EMR) distribution of Hadoop. Netflix cites the main reason for its choice as the following: S3 is designed for 99.999999999% durability and 99.99% availability of objects over a given year, and S3 can sustain concurrent loss of data in two facilities. S3 provides bucket versioning, which allows Netflix to recover inadvertently deleted data. The elasticity of S3 has allowed Netflix a practi-cally unlimited storage capacity; this capacity has enabled Netflix to grow its storage from a few hundred terabytes to petabytes without any difficulty or prior planning. Using S3 as the data warehouse enables Netflix to run multiple Hadoop clusters that are fault-tolerant and can sustain excess load. Netflix executives claim that they have no concerns about data redistribution or loss during expansion or shrinking of the warehouse. Although Netflix’s production and query clusters are long-running clus-ters in the cloud, they can be essentially treated as completely transient. If a cluster goes down, Netflix can simply substitute with another identically sized cluster, pos-sibly in a different geographic zone, in a few minutes and not sustain any data loss.\\n25.6.3  Data Locality Issues and Resource Optimization  \\nfor Big Data Applications in a Cloud\\nThe increasing interest in cloud computing combined with the demands of big data \\ntechnology means that data centers must be increasingly cost-effective and con-\\nsumer-driven. Also, many cloud infrastructures are not intrinsically designed to \\nhandle the scale of data required for present-day data analytics. Cloud service pro-\\nviders are faced with daunting challenges in terms of resource management and capacity planning to provide for big data technology applications.\\nThe network load of many big data applications, including Hadoop/MapReduce, is of \\nspecial concern in a data center because large amounts of data can be generated dur-ing job execution. For instance, in a MapReduce job, each reduce task needs to read the output of all map tasks, and a sudden explosion of network traffic can signifi-cantly deteriorate cloud performance. Also, when data is located in one infrastructure (say, in a storage cloud like Amazon S3) and processed in a compute cloud (such as Amazon EC2), job performance suffers significant delays due to data loading.\\nResearch projects have proposed\\n25 a self-configurable, locality-based data and vir-\\ntual machine management framework based on the storage-compute model. This framework enables MapReduce jobs to access most of their data either locally or from close-by nodes, including all input, output, and intermediate data generated \\nduring map and reduce phases of the jobs. Such frameworks categorize jobs using a data-size sensitive classifier into four classes based on a data size–based footprint. Then they provision virtual MapReduce clusters in a locality-aware manner, which enables efficient pairing and allocation of MapReduce virtual machines (VMs) to reduce the network distance between storage and compute nodes for both map and reduce processing.\\n25See Palanisamy et al. (2011).'),\n",

Caching techniques allow flexibility in that data is stored in a separate storage infrastructure that allows prefetching and caching of the most essential data. Recent work\\n27 has addressed the big data caching problem in the context of \\nprivacy-conscious scenarios, wherein data stored in encrypted form in a public cloud must be processed in a separate, secure enterprise site.\\nIn addition to the data locality problem, one of the most challenging goals for cloud \\nproviders is to optimally provision virtual clusters for jobs while minimizing the overall consumption cost of the cloud data center.\\nAn important focus of cloud resource optimization is to optimize globally across all \\njobs in the cloud as opposed to per-job resource optimizations. A good example of a globally optimized cloud- managed system is the recent Google BigQuery sys-tem,\\n28 which allows Google to run SQL-like queries against very large datasets with \\npotentially billions of rows using an Excel-like interface. In the BigQuery service, \\ncustomers only submit the queries to be processed on the large datasets, and the \\ncloud system intelligently manages the resources for the SQL-like queries. Simi-larly, the Cura resource optimization model\\n29 proposed for MapReduce in a cloud \\nachieves global resource optimization by minimizing the overall resource utiliza-\\ntion in the cloud as opposed to per-job or per-customer resource optimization.\\n25.6.4 YARN as a Data Service Platform\\nThe separation of resource management from application management has taken \\nHadoop to another level as a platform. Hadoop v1 was all about MapReduce. In \\nHadoop v2, MapReduce is one of the many application frameworks that can run on \\nthe cluster. As we discussed in Section 25.5, this has opened the door for many services (with their own programming models) to be provided on YARN. There is no need to translate all data processing techniques and algorithms into a set of MapReduce jobs. MapReduce is presently being used only for batch-oriented processing such as the \\nETL (extract, transform, load) process in data warehouses (see Chapter 29). The emerging trend is to see Hadoop as a data lake , where a significant portion of enter-\\nprise data resides and where processing happens. Traditionally, HDFS has been where an enterprise’s historical data resides because HDFS can handle the scale of such data. Most new sources of data, which in today’s search and social networking applications come from Web and machine logs, clickstream data, message data (as in Twitter) and sensor data, also is being stored largely in HDFS.\\n26See the PACMAN framework by Ananthanarayanan et al. (2012) and the MixApart system by \\n Mihailescu et al. (2013).\\n27See Palanisamy et al. (2014a).\\n28For the Google BigQuery system, see https://developers.google.com/bigquery/\\n29Palanisamy et al. (2014b).'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 980}, page_content='950 Chapter 25 Big Data Technologies Based on MapReduce and Hadoop\\nThe Hadoop v1 model was the federation  model: although HDFS was the storage \\nlayer for the enterprise, processing was a mixture of MapReduce and other engines. One alternative was to extract data from HDFS store to engines running outside the cluster in their own silos; such data was moved to graph engines, machine learning analytical applications, and so forth. The same machines as those used for the Hadoop cluster were being used for entirely different applications, such as stream processing outside of Hadoop. This scenario was far from ideal since phys-ical resources had to be divvied up in a static manner and it was difficult to migrate and upgrade to new versions when multiple frameworks ran on the same machines. With YARN, the above issues are addressed. Traditional services are taking advan-tage of the YARN ResourceManager and are providing their service on the same Hadoop cluster where the data resides.\\nWhereas support for SQL in Hadoop was promised by multiple vendors, the actual \\nsupport has been less than completely desirable. Some vendors required the HDFS data to be moved out to another database to run SQL; some required wrappers to read the HDFS data before an SQL query ran on it. A new trend among RDBMSs and traditional database systems considers a YARN cluster as a viable platform. One example is Actian’s analytics platform, which provides SQL in Hadoop\\n30 and \\nwhich is claimed to be a complete and robust implementation of SQL using the \\nActian Vectorwise columnar database (which runs as a YARN application). IBM’s \\nBig SQL 3.031 is a project that makes an existing IBM shared-nothing DBMS run \\non a YARN cluster.\\nApache Storm is a distributed scalable streaming engine that allows users to pro-\\ncess real-time data feeds. It is widely used by Twitter. Storm on YARN (http://hortonworks.com/labs/storm/) and SAS on YARN (http://hortonworks.com/partner/sas/) are applications that treat Storm (a distributed stream processing application) and SAS (statistical analysis software) as applications on the YARN platform. As we discussed previously, Giraph and HBase Hoya are ongoing efforts that are rapidly adopting YARN. A wide range of application systems uses the Hadoop cluster for storage; examples include services like streaming, machine learning/statistics, graph processing, OLAP, and key-value stores. These services go well beyond MapReduce. The goal/promise of YARN is for these services to coexist on the same cluster and take advantage of the locality of data in HDFS while YARN orchestrates their use of cluster resources.\\n25.6.5 Challenges Faced by Big Data Technologies\\nIn a recent article,32 several database experts voiced their concerns about the \\nimpending challenges faced by big data technologies when such technologies \\n30Current documentation is available at http://www.actian.com/about-us/blog/sql-hadoop-real-deal/\\n31Current information is available at: http://www.slideshare.net/Hadoop_\\nSummit/w-325p230-azubirigrayatv4\\n32See Jagadish et al.

These concerns include the \\n following:\\n ■Heterogeneity of information:  Heterogeneity in terms of data types, data \\nformats, data representation, and semantics is unavoidable when it comes to sources of data. One of the phases in the big data life cycle involves integra-tion of this data. The cost of doing a clean job of integration to bring all data into a single structure is prohibitive for most applications, such as health-care, energy, transportation, urban planning, and environmental modeling. Most machine learning algorithms expect data to be fed into them in a uni-form structure. The data provenance (which refers to the information about the origin and ownership of data) is typically not maintained in most analyt-ics applications. Proper interpretation of data analysis results requires large amounts of metadata.\\n ■Privacy and confidentiality:  Regulations and laws regarding protection of \\nconfidential information are not always available and hence not applied strictly during big data analysis. Enforcement of HIPAA regulations in the healthcare environment is one of few instances where privacy and confiden-tiality are strictly enforced. Location-based applications (such as on smart phones and other GPS-equipped devices), logs of user transactions, and clickstreams that capture user behavior all reveal confidential information. User movement and buying patterns can be tracked to reveal personal iden-tity. Because it is now possible to harness and analyze billions of users’ records via the technologies described in this chapter, there is widespread concern about personal information being compromised (e.g., data about individuals could be leaked from social data networks that are in some way linked to other data networks). Data about customers, cardholders, and employees is held by organizations and thus is subject to breaches of confidentiality. Jag-adish et al. (2014) voiced a need for stricter control over digital rights man-agement of data similar to the control exercised in the music industry.\\n ■Need for visualization and better human interfaces:  Huge volumes of data \\nare crunched by big data systems, and the results of analyses must be inter-\\npreted and understood by humans. Human preferences must be accounted \\nfor and data must be presented in a properly digestible form. Humans are experts at detecting patterns and have great intuition about data they are familiar with. Machines cannot match humans in this regard. It should be possible to bring together multiple human experts to share and interpret results of analysis and thereby increase understanding of those results. Mul-tiple modes of visual exploration must be possible to make the best use of data and to properly interpret results that are out of range and thus are clas-sified as outlier values.\\n ■Inconsistent and incomplete information:  This has been a perennial prob-\\nlem in data collection and management. Future big data systems will allow \\nmultiple sources to be handled by multiple coexisting applications, so prob-\\nlems due to missing data, erroneous data, and uncertain data will be com-\\npounded.

There is an inherent uncertainty about data collected from regular users using normal devices when such data comes in multiple forms (e.g., images, rates of speed, direction of travel). There is still a lot to be learned about how to use crowdsourcing data to generate effective decision making.\\nThe aforementioned issues are not new to information systems. However, the large \\nvolume and wide variety of information inherent in big data systems compounds these issues.\\n25.6.6 Moving Forward\\nYARN makes it feasible for enterprises to run and manage many services on one cluster. But building data solutions on Hadoop is still a daunting challenge. A solu-tion may involve assembling ETL (extract, transform, load) processing, machine learning, graph processing, and/or report creation. Although these different func-tional engines all run on the same cluster, their programming models and metadata are not unified. Analytics application developers must try to integrate all these ser-vices into a coherent solution.\\nOn current hardware, each node contains a significant amount of main memory \\nand flash memory storage. The cluster thus becomes a vast resource of main mem-ory and flash storage. Significant innovation has demonstrated the performance gains of in-memory data engines ; for example, SAP HANA is an in-memory, \\ncolumnar scale-out RDBMS that is gaining a wide following.\\n33\\nThe Spark platform from Databricks (https://databricks.com/), which is an off-shoot of the Berkeley Data Analytics Stack from AMPLabs at Berkeley,\\n34addresses \\nboth of the advances mentioned above—namely, the ability to house diverse applica tions in one cluster and the ability to use vast amounts of main memory for\\xa0faster response. Matei Zaharia developed the Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDD) concept\\n35 as a part of his Ph.D. work at the University of California–Berkeley \\nthat gave rise to the Spark system. The concept is generic enough to be used across all Spark’s engines: Spark core (data flow), Spark-SQL, GraphX, (graph process-ing), MLLib (machine learning), and Spark-Streaming (stream processing). For example, it is possible to write a script in Spark that expresses a data flow that reads data from HDFS, reshapes the data using a Spark-SQL query, passes that information to an MLLib function for machine learning–type analysis, and then stores the result back in HDFS.\\n36\\n34See https://amplab.cs.berkeley.edu/software/ for projects at Amplab from the University of California– \\nBerkeley.\\n35The RDD concept was first proposed in Zaharia et al. (2012).\\n36See an example of the use of Spark at https://databricks.com/blog/2014/03/26/spark-sql- \\nmanipulating-structured-data-using-spark-2.html33See http://www.saphana.com/welcome for a variety of documentation on SAP’s HANA system.'),\n",

RDDs can be configured based on how their data is distributed and how their data is represented: it can be always re-created from input, and it can be cached on disk or in memory. In-memory representa-tions vary from serialized Java objects to highly optimized columnar formats that have all the advantages of columnar databases (e.g., speed, footprint, operating in serialized form).\\nThe capabilities of a unified programming model and in-memory datasets will \\nlikely be incorporated into the Hadoop ecosystem. Spark is already available as a service in YARN (http://spark.apache.org/docs/1.0.0/running-on-yarn.html).

After giving a historical development of the technology and mentioning the Hadoop eco-system, which spans a large number of currently active Apache projects, we dis-cussed the Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) by outlining its architecture and its handling of file operations; we also touched on the scalability studies done on HDFS. We then gave details of the MapReduce runtime environment. We provided \\nexamples of how the MapReduce paradigm can be applied to a variety of contexts; \\nwe gave a detailed example of its application to optimizing various relational join algorithms. We then presented briefly the developments of Pig and Hive, the sys-tems that provide an SQL-like interface with Pig Latin and HiveQL on top of the low-level MapReduce programming. We also mentioned the advantages of the joint Hadoop/MapReduce technology.\\nHadoop/MapReduce is undergoing further development and is being repositioned \\nas version 2, known as MRv2 or YARN; version 2 separates resource management from task/job management. We discussed the rationale behind YARN, its architec-ture, and other ongoing frameworks based on YARN, including Apache Tez, a workflow modeling environment; Apache Giraph, a large-scale graph processing system based on Pregel of Google; and Hoya, a Hortonworks rendering of HBase \\nelastic clusters on YARN.\\n37See http://docs.scala-lang.org/overviews/core/architecture-of-scala-collections.html for more information \\non Scala Collections.'),\n",

The origin of this wave is traced back to the seminal papers from Google, including the Google file system (Ghemawat, Gobioff, & Leung, 2003) and the MapReduce programming paradigm (Dean & Ghemawat, 2004). The Nutch system with follow-on work at Yahoo is a precursor of the Hadoop technology and continues as an Apache open source project (nutch.apache.org). The BigTable sys-tem from Google (Fay Chang et al., 2006) describes a distributed scalable storage system for managing structured data in the petabytes range over thousands of com-modity servers.\\nIt is not possible to name a specific single publication as “the” Hadoop paper. Many \\nstudies related to MapReduce and Hadoop have been published in the past decade. We will list only a few landmark developments here. Schvachko (2012) outlines the limitations of the HDFS file system. Afrati and Ullman (2010) is a good example of using MapReduce programming in various contexts and applications; they demon-strate how to optimize relational join operations in MapReduce. Olston et al. (2008) describe the Pig system and introduce Pig Latin as a high-level programming lan-guage. Thusoo et al. (2010) describe Hive as a petabyte- scale data warehouse on top of Hadoop. A system for large-scale graph processing called Pregel at Google is described in Malewicz et al. (2010). It uses the bulk synchronous parallel (BSP) model of parallel computation originally proposed by Valiant (1990). In Pavlo et al. (2009), a number of database technology experts compared two parallel RDBMSs with Hadoop/MapReduce and showed how the parallel DBMS can actually per-form better under certain conditions. The results of this study must not be consid-ered definitive because of the significant performance improvements achieved in Hadoop v2 (YARN). The approach of resilient distributed datasets (RDDs) for in-memory cluster computing is at the heart of the Berkeley’s Spark system, developed by Zaharia et al. (2013). A recent paper by Jagadish et al. (2014) gives the collective opinion of a number of database experts about the challenges faced by the current big data technologies.\\nThe definitive resource for Hadoop application developers is the book Hadoop: The \\nDefinitive Guide , by Tom White (2012), which is in its third edition. A book by \\nYARN project founder Arun Murthy with Vavilapalli (2014) describes how YARN increases scalability and cluster utilization, enables new programming models and services, and extends applicability beyond batch applications and Java. Agneeswaran (2014) has written about going beyond Hadoop, and he describes the Berkeley Data Analysis Stack (BDAS) for real-time analytics and machine learning; the Stack includes Spark, Mesos, and Shark. He also describes Storm, a complex event-pro-cessing engine from Twitter widely used in industry today for real-time computing and analytics.\\nThe Hadoop wiki is at Hadoop.apache.org.

Object-oriented databases and \\nobject-relational systems do provide features that allow users to extend their sys-\\ntems by specifying additional abstract data types for each application. However, it is useful to identify certain common features for some of these advanced applications and to create models that can represent them. Additionally, specialized storage structures and indexing methods can be implemented to improve the performance of these common features. Then the features can be implemented as abstract data types or class libraries and purchased separately from the basic DBMS software package. The term data blade  has been used in Informix and cartridge  in Oracle to \\nrefer to such optional submodules that can be included in a DBMS package. Users can utilize these features directly if they are suitable for their applications, without having to reinvent, reimplement, and reprogram such common features.\\nThis chapter introduces database concepts for some of the common features that \\nare needed by advanced applications and are being used widely. We will cover active rules  that are used in active database applications, temporal concepts  that \\nare used in temporal database applications, and, briefly, some of the issues involv-\\ning spatial databases  and multimedia databases.

In fact, each of these areas can serve as the sole \\ntopic of a complete book.\\nIn Section 26.1, we introduce the topic of active databases, which provide addi-\\ntional functionality for specifying active rules . These rules can be automatically \\ntriggered by events that occur, such as database updates or certain times being reached, and can initiate certain actions that have been specified in the rule declara-tion to occur if certain conditions are met. Many commercial packages include some of the functionality provided by active databases in the form of triggers . \\nTriggers are now part of the SQL-99 and later standards.\\nIn Section 26.2, we introduce the concepts of temporal databases , which permit \\nthe database system to store a history of changes and allow users to query both cur-rent and past states of the database. Some temporal database models also allow users to store future expected information, such as planned schedules. It is impor-tant to note that many database applications are temporal, but they are often imple-mented without having much temporal support from the DBMS package—that is, the temporal concepts are implemented in the application programs that access the database. The ability to create and query temporal data has been added to the SQL standard in SQL:2011 and is available in the DB2 system, but we do not discuss it here. The interested reader is referred to the end-of-chapter bibliography.\\nSection 26.3 gives a brief overview of spatial database  concepts. We discuss types of \\nspatial data, different kinds of spatial analyses, operations on spatial data, types of spatial queries, spatial data indexing, spatial data mining, and applications of spatial databases. Most commercial and open source relational systems provide spatial support in their data types and query languages as well as providing indexing and efficient query processing for common spatial operations.\\nSection 26.4 is devoted to multimedia database concepts. Multimedia databases  \\nprovide features that allow users to store and query different types of multimedia information, which includes images  (such as pictures and drawings), video clips  \\n(such as movies, newsreels, and home videos), audio clips  (such as songs, phone \\nmessages, and speeches), and documents  (such as books and articles). We discuss \\nautomatic analysis of images, object recognition in images, and semantic tagging of images.\\nIn Section 26.5, we discuss deductive databases,\\n1 an area that is at the intersection of \\ndatabases, logic, and artificial intelligence or knowledge bases. A deductive \\n database system  includes capabilities to define (deductive) rules , which can deduce \\nor infer additional information from the facts that are stored in a database.

Section 26.6 summarizes the chapter.\\nReaders may choose to peruse the particular topics they are interested in, as the sec-\\ntions in this chapter are practically independent of one another.\\n26.1 Active Database Concepts and Triggers\\nRules that specify actions that are automatically triggered by certain events have been considered important enhancements to database systems for quite some time. In fact, the concept of triggers —a technique for specifying certain types of active \\nrules—has existed in early versions of the SQL specification for relational databases, and triggers are now part of the SQL-99 and later standards. Commercial relational DBMSs—such as Oracle, DB2, and Microsoft SQLServer—have various versions of triggers available. However, much research into what a general model for active databases should look like has been done since the early models of triggers were proposed. In Section 26.1.1, we will present the general concepts that have been proposed for specifying rules for active databases. We will use the syntax of the Oracle commercial relational DBMS to illustrate these concepts with specific exam-ples, since Oracle triggers are close to the way rules are specified in the SQL stan-dard. Section 26.1.2 will discuss some general design and implementation issues for active databases. We give examples of how active databases are implemented in the \\nSTARBURST experimental DBMS in Section 26.1.3, since STARBURST provides \\nfor many of the concepts of generalized active databases within its framework. Sec-tion 26.1.4 discusses possible applications of active databases. Finally, Section 26.1.5 describes how triggers are declared in the SQL-99 standard.\\n26.1.1  Generalized Model for Active Databases  \\nand Oracle Triggers\\nThe model that has been used to specify active database rules is referred to as \\nthe event-condition-action  (ECA)  model. A rule in the ECA model has three \\ncomponents:\\n  1. The event(s)  that triggers the rule: These events are usually database \\nupdate operations that are explicitly applied to the database. However, in the general model, they could also be temporal events\\n2 or other kinds of \\nexternal events.\\n  2. The condition  that determines whether the rule action should be executed: \\nOnce the triggering event has occurred, an optional  condition may be evalu-\\nated. If no condition  is specified, the action will be executed once the event \\n2An example would be a temporal event specified as a periodic time, such as: Trigger this rule every day \\nat 5:30 a.m.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 994}, page_content='964 Chapter 26 Enhanced Data Models\\noccurs. If a condition is specified, it is first evaluated, and only if it evaluates \\nto true  will the rule action be executed.\\n  3. The action  to be taken: The action is usually a sequence of SQL statements, \\nbut it could also be a database transaction or an external program that will be automatically executed.\\nLet us consider some examples to illustrate these concepts. The examples are \\nbased on a much simplified variation of the \\nCOMPANY  database application \\nfrom Figure 5.5 and are shown in Figure 26.1, with each employee having a name (\\nName ), Social Security number ( Ssn), salary ( Salary ), department to \\nwhich she is currently assigned ( Dno, a foreign key to DEPARTMENT ), and a \\ndirect supervisor ( Supervisor_ssn , a (recursive) foreign key to EMPLOYEE ). For \\nthis example, we assume that NULL  is allowed for Dno, indicating that an \\nemployee may be temporarily unassigned to any department. Each department has a name (\\nDname ), number ( Dno), the total salary of all employees assigned to \\nthe department ( Total_sal ), and a manager ( Manager_ssn , which is a foreign key \\nto EMPLOYEE ).\\nNotice that the Total_sal  attribute is really a derived attribute whose value should be \\nthe sum of the salaries of all employees who are assigned to the particular depart-ment. Maintaining the correct value of such a derived attribute can be done via an active rule. First we have to determine the events  that may cause  a change in the \\nvalue of \\nTotal_sal , which are as follows:\\n  1. Inserting (one or more) new employee tuples\\n  2. Changing the salary of (one or more) existing employees\\n  3. Changing the assignment of existing employees from one department to another\\n  4. Deleting (one or more) employee tuples\\nIn the case of event 1, we only need to recompute Total_sal  if the new employee is \\nimmediately assigned to a department—that is, if the value of the Dno attribute for \\nthe new employee tuple is not NULL  (assuming NULL  is allowed for Dno). Hence, this \\nwould be the condition  to be checked. A similar condition could be checked for \\nevent 2 (and 4) to determine whether the employee whose salary is changed (or who is being deleted) is currently assigned to a department. For event 3, we will always execute an action to maintain the value of \\nTotal_sal  correctly, so no condition \\nis needed (the action is always executed).Name Ssn Salary Dno Supervisor_ssnEMPLOYEE\\nDname Dno Total_sal Manager_ssnDEPARTMENTFigure 26.1 \\nA simplified COMPANY database used for active rule examples.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 995}, page_content='26.1 Active Database Concepts and Triggers  965\\nThe action  for events 1, 2, and 4 is to automatically update the value of Total_sal  for \\nthe employee’s department to reflect the newly inserted, updated, or deleted employee’s salary. In the case of event 3, a twofold action is needed: one to update the \\nTotal_sal  of the employee’s old department and the other to update the Total_sal  \\nof the employee’s new department.\\nThe four active rules (or triggers) R1, R2, R3, and R4—corresponding to the above \\nsituation—can be specified in the notation of the Oracle DBMS as shown in Fig-ure\\xa026.2(a). Let us consider rule R1 to illustrate the syntax of creating triggers in Oracle. The \\nCREATE  TRIGGER  statement specifies a trigger (or active rule) name—\\nTotal_sal1  for R1. The AFTER  clause specifies that the rule will be triggered after  the \\nevents that trigger the rule occur. The triggering events—an insert of a new employee in this example—are specified following the \\nAFTER  keyword.3\\nThe ON clause specifies the relation on which the rule is specified— EMPLOYEE  for \\nR1. The optional  keywords FOR EACH ROW  specify that the rule will be triggered \\nonce for each row  that is affected by the triggering event.4\\nThe optional  WHEN  clause is used to specify any conditions that need to be checked \\nafter the rule is triggered, but before the action is executed. Finally, the action(s) to \\nbe taken is (are) specified as a PL/SQL block, which typically contains one or more \\nSQL statements or calls to execute external procedures.\\nThe four triggers (active rules) R1, R2, R3, and R4 illustrate a number of features of \\nactive rules. First, the basic events  that can be specified for triggering the rules are the \\nstandard SQL update commands: INSERT , DELETE , and UPDATE . They are specified by \\nthe keywords INSERT , DELETE , and UPDATE  in Oracle notation. In the case of UPDATE , \\none may specify the attributes to be updated—for example, by writing UPDATE OF  \\nSalary , Dno. Second, the rule designer needs to have a way to refer to the tuples that have \\nbeen inserted, deleted, or modified by the triggering event. The keywords NEW  and OLD \\nare used in Oracle notation; NEW  is used to refer to a newly inserted or newly updated \\ntuple, whereas OLD is used to refer to a deleted tuple or to a tuple before it was updated.\\nThus, rule R1 is triggered after an INSERT  operation is applied to the EMPLOYEE  \\nrelation. In R1, the condition ( NEW .Dno IS NOT NULL ) is checked, and if it evaluates \\nto true, meaning that the newly inserted employee tuple is related to a department, \\nthen the action is executed. The action updates the DEPARTMENT  tuple(s) related to \\nthe newly inserted employee by adding their salary ( NEW .Salary ) to the Total_sal  \\nattribute of their related department.\\nRule R2 is similar to R1, but it is triggered by an UPDATE  operation that updates the \\nSALARY  of an employee rather than by an INSERT . Rule R3 is triggered by an update \\nto the Dno attribute of EMPLOYEE , which signifies changing an employee’s assign-\\nment from one department to another. There is no condition to check in R3, so the \\n3As we will see, it is also possible to specify BEFORE instead of AFTER, which indicates that the rule is \\ntriggered before the triggering event is executed.\\n4Again, we will see that an alternative is to trigger the rule only once  even if multiple rows (tuples) are \\naffected by the triggering event.'),\n",

The action updates both \\nthe old department and new department of the reassigned employees by adding their salary to \\nTotal_sal  of their new department and subtracting their salary from \\nTotal_sal  of their old department. Note that this should work even if the value of Dno \\nis NULL , because in this case no department will be selected for the rule action.5\\nIt is important to note the effect of the optional FOR EACH ROW  clause, which sig-\\nnifies that the rule is triggered separately for each tuple.  This is known as a row-\\nlevel trigger . If this clause was left out, the trigger would be known as a \\nstatement-level trigger  and would be triggered once for each triggering statement. \\nTo see the difference, consider the following update operation, which gives a 10% raise to all employees assigned to department 5. This operation would be an event that triggers rule \\nR2:\\nUPDATE  EMPLOYEE\\nSET Salary  = 1.1 * Salary\\nWHERE  Dno  = 5;\\nBecause the above statement could update multiple records, a rule using row-level \\nsemantics, such as R2 in Figure 26.2, would be triggered once for each row , whereas \\na rule using statement-level semantics is triggered only once.  The Oracle system \\nallows the user to choose which of the above options is to be used for each rule. \\nIncluding the optional FOR EACH ROW  clause creates a row-level trigger, and leav-\\ning it out creates a statement-level trigger. Note that the keywords NEW  and OLD  \\ncan only be used with row-level triggers.\\nAs a second example, suppose we want to check whenever an employee’s salary is \\ngreater than the salary of his or her direct supervisor. Several events can trigger this rule: inserting a new employee, changing an employee’s salary, or changing an employee’s supervisor. Suppose that the action to take would be to call an external procedure \\ninform_supervisor ,6 which will notify the supervisor. The rule could then \\nbe written as in R5 (see Figure 26.2(b)).\\nFigure 26.3 shows the syntax for specifying some of the main options available in \\nOracle triggers. We will describe the syntax for triggers in the SQL-99 standard in Section 26.1.5.\\n26.1.2  Design and Implementation Issues  \\nfor Active Databases\\nThe previous section gave an overview of some of the main concepts for speci-\\nfying active rules. In this section, we discuss some additional issues concerning how rules are designed and implemented. The first issue concerns activation, \\n5R1, R2, and R4 can also be written without a condition.

In addition to creating rules, an active \\ndatabase system should allow users to activate , deactivate , and drop  rules by \\nreferring to their rule names. A deactivated rule  will not be triggered by the \\ntriggering event. This feature allows users to selectively deactivate rules for cer-tain periods of time when they are not needed. The activate command  will \\nmake the rule active again. The drop command  deletes the rule from the sys-\\ntem. Another option is to group rules into named rule sets , so the whole set of \\nrules can be activated, deactivated, or dropped. It is also useful to have a com-mand that can trigger a rule or rule set via an explicit \\nPROCESS RULES  com-\\nmand issued by the user.\\nThe second issue concerns whether the triggered action should be executed before, \\nafter, instead of , or concurrently with  the triggering event. A before trigger  exe-\\ncutes the trigger before executing the event that caused the trigger. It can be used in applications such as checking for constraint violations. An after trigger  exe-\\ncutes the trigger after executing the event, and it can be used in applications such as maintaining derived data and monitoring for specific events and conditions. An instead of trigger  executes the trigger instead of executing the event, and it can be \\nused in applications such as executing corresponding updates on base relations in response to an event that is an update of a view.\\nA related issue is whether the action being executed should be considered as a \\nseparate transaction  or whether it should be part of the same transaction that \\ntriggered the rule. We will try to categorize the various options. It is important to note that not all options may be available for a particular active database sys-tem. In fact, most commercial systems are limited to one or two of the options  \\nthat we will now discuss.\\nLet us assume that the triggering event occurs as part of a transaction execution. \\nWe should first consider the various options for how the triggering event is related to the evaluation of the rule’s condition. The rule condition evaluation  is also \\nknown as rule consideration , since the action is to be executed only after consid-\\nering whether the condition evaluates to true or false. There are three main possi-bilities for rule consideration:'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 999}, page_content='26.1 Active Database Concepts and Triggers  969\\n  1. Immediate consideration.  The condition is evaluated as part of the same \\ntransaction as the triggering event and is evaluated immediately.  This case \\ncan be further categorized into three options:\\n /box4Evaluate the condition before  executing the triggering event.\\n /box4Evaluate the condition after  executing the triggering event.\\n /box4Evaluate the condition instead of  executing the triggering event.\\n  2. Deferred consideration.  The condition is evaluated at the end of the trans-\\naction that included the triggering event. In this case, there could be many triggered rules waiting to have their conditions evaluated.\\n  3. Detached consideration.  The condition is evaluated as a separate transac-\\ntion, spawned from the triggering transaction.\\nThe next set of options concerns the relationship between evaluating the rule \\ncondition and executing  the rule action. Here, again, three options are possible: \\nimmediate , deferred , or detached  execution. Most active systems use the first \\noption. That is, as soon as the condition is evaluated, if it returns true, the action is immediately  executed.\\nThe Oracle system (see Section 26.1.1) uses the immediate consideration  model, but \\nit allows the user to specify for each rule whether the before  or after  option is to be \\nused with immediate condition evaluation. It also uses the immediate execution  \\nmodel. The STARBURST system (see Section 26.1.3) uses the deferred consider-\\nation  option, meaning that all rules triggered by a transaction wait until the trigger-\\ning transaction reaches its end and issues its \\nCOMMIT WORK  command before the \\nrule conditions are evaluated.7\\nAnother issue concerning active database rules is the distinction between row-level \\nrules  and statement-level rules.  Because SQL update statements (which act as trig-\\ngering events) can specify a set of tuples, one must distinguish between whether the rule should be considered once for the whole statement  or whether it should be \\nconsidered separately for each row  (that is, tuple) affected by the statement. The \\nSQL-99 standard (see Section 26.1.5) and the Oracle system (see Section 26.1.1) allow the user to choose which of the options is to be used for each rule, whereas STARBURST uses statement-level semantics only. We will give examples of how statement-level triggers can be specified in Section 26.1.3.\\nOne of the difficulties that may have limited the widespread use of active rules, in \\nspite of their potential to simplify database and software development, is that there \\nare no easy-to-use techniques for designing, writing, and verifying rules. For exam-ple, it is difficult to verify that a set of rules is consistent , meaning that two or more \\nrules in the set do not contradict one another. It is also difficult to guarantee  termination  of a set of rules under all circumstances. To illustrate the termination \\nproblem briefly, consider the rules in Figure 26.4. Here, rule \\nR1 is triggered by an \\nINSERT  event on TABLE1  and its action includes an update event on Attribute1  of \\n7ST ARBURST also allows the user to start rule consideration explicitly via a PROCESS RULES command.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'RDB.pdf', 'page': 1000}, page_content='970 Chapter 26 Enhanced Data Models\\nTABLE2 . However, rule R2’s triggering event is an UPDATE  event on Attribute1  of \\nTABLE2 , and its action includes an INSERT  event on TABLE1 . In this example, it is \\neasy to see that these two rules can trigger one another indefinitely, leading to non-termination. However, if dozens of rules are written, it is very difficult to determine whether termination is guaranteed or not.\\nIf active rules are to reach their potential, it is necessary to develop tools for the \\ndesign, debugging, and monitoring of active rules that can help users design and debug their rules.\\n26.1.3  Examples of Statement-Level Active Rules  \\nin STARBURST\\nWe now give some examples to illustrate how rules can be specified in the STARBURST \\nexperimental DBMS. This will allow us to demonstrate how statement-level rules can be written, since these are the only types of rules allowed in STARBURST.\\nThe three active rules \\nR1S, R2S, and R3S in Figure 26.5 correspond to the first three \\nrules in Figure 26.2, but they use STARBURST notation and statement-level seman-tics. We can explain the rule structure using rule \\nR1S. The CREATE RULE  statement \\nspecifies a rule name— Total_sal1  for R1S. The ON clause specifies the relation on \\nwhich the rule is specified— EMPLOYEE  for R1S. The WHEN  clause is used to specify \\nthe events  that trigger the rule.8 The optional  IF clause is used to specify any \\n conditions  that need to be checked. Finally, the THEN  clause is used to specify the \\nactions  to be taken, which are typically one or more SQL statements.\\nIn STARBURST, the basic events that can be specified for triggering the rules are \\nthe standard SQL update commands: INSERT , DELETE , and UPDATE . These are \\nspecified by the keywords INSERTED , DELETED , and UPDATED  in STARBURST \\nnotation. Second, the rule designer needs to have a way to refer to the tuples that have been modified. The keywords \\nINSERTED , DELETED , NEW-UPDATED , and \\nOLD-UPDATED  are used in STARBURST notation to refer to four transition tables  \\n(relations) that include the newly inserted tuples, the deleted tuples, the updated R1: CREATE TRIGGER  T1\\n AFTER INSERT ON  TABLE1\\n FOR EACH ROW\\n  UPDATE  TABLE2\\n  SET Attribute1 = … ;\\nR2: CREATE TRIGGER  T2\\n AFTER UPDATE OF  Attribute1 ON TABLE2\\n FOR EACH ROW\\n  INSERT INTO  TABLE1 VALUES  ( … ) ;Figure 26.4 \\nAn example to illustrate the termination problem for active rules.\\n8Note that the WHEN keyword specifies events  in ST ARBURST but is used to specify the rule condition  \\nin SQL and Oracle triggers.'),\n",
