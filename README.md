 SKQA is designed to automatically generate structured KCs with multiple relationships and create diverse question-answer datasets by leveraging these structured KCs. To illustrate the capabilities of SKQA, the course Fundamentals of Database Systems (FDS) is adopted as an example to demonstrate how our proposed system generates seven structured knowledge component groups with multiple relationships, which is significantly better
than other related datasets. Moreover, SKQA generates more than 1000 pairs of questions and answers at varying levels of difficulty and cognitive development. The qualitative and quantitative evaluation results demonstrate that our system has strong potential in generating structured knowledge components and high-quality, diverse
questionâ€“answer pairs based on the relationships among KCs.
